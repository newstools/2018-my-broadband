Kaspersky Lab has discovered sophisticated new malware for Android, which it said has capabilities “reminiscent of Hollywood spy movies.” Called Skygofree, it was disguised as an update to improve mobile Internet speed on fake mobile operator websites. Once installed on a device, Skygofree can track the location of that device and turn on audio recording when in a certain place. “In practice, this means that attackers can start listening in on victims when, say, they enter the office or visit the CEO’s home,” said Kaspersky Lab. Skygofree can also connect to a Wi-Fi network, even if you have disabled Wi-Fi connections. “This lets the victim’s traffic be collected and analysed,” said Kaspersky said. The malware can also monitor apps such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. In WhatsApp’s case, it reads the messages through Accessibility Services. It is also able to operate in standby mode. On one unnamed “major” smartphone brand, which stops all apps except for certain favourites when the screen is turned off, Skygofree adds itself to the favourites list.
