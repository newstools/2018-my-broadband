Google has announced that from July, page speed will be a ranking factor for mobile searches. “People want to be able to find answers to their questions as fast as possible – studies show that people really care about the speed of a page,” said Google. Although page speed is already used in rankings, it was focused on desktop searches. Google will now add this ranking factor to mobile searches, but it will only affect pages that deliver the slowest experience to users and will only affect a small percentage of queries. “It applies the same standard to all pages, regardless of the technology used to build the page.” “The intent of the search query is still a very strong signal, so a slow page may still rank highly if it has great, relevant content.”
