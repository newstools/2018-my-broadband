Linux creator Linus Torvalds has released version 4.15 of the Linux kernel. The release was recently delayed due to the disclosure of speculative execution vulnerabilities affecting many processors. “This obviously was not a pleasant release cycle, with the whole meltdown/spectre thing coming in in the middle of the cycle. The extra two weeks were obviously mainly due to that whole timing issue,” said Torvalds. Torvalds added that the release of Linux 4.15 does not mean developers are finished dealing with the vulnerabilities. There is more work to be done on patches for ARM-based processors. Torvalds also stated that programmers need the kernel updates and a compiler with support for the “retpoline” indirect brand model to enjoy full mitigation support. “The bulk of the 4.15 work is all the regular plodding boring stuff. And I mean that in the best possible way,” said Torvalds. Two thirds of the updates in the kernel involved drivers, which include graphics processors, input, and networking driver updates.
