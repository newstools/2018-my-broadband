Nexus ISP has informed clients their services will be migrated to Webafrica and Gridhost between 1-7 February 2018. “This was not a decision we made lightly,” said Nexus. “Nexus has developed trusted relationships with both Webafrica and Gridhost over the last number of years.” Services will be migrated with virtually no disruptions and no major changes to users, it added. Webafrica acquired Nexus ISP several years ago, but the companies operated under separate brands. The migration comes after Webafrica spun off its hosting business under the Gridhost brand in November. Nexus ISP said its hosting and email products, as well as virtual private servers and FreePBX services, will migrate to Gridhost. Its Internet connectivity and VoIP services will move to Webafrica. “Webafrica and Gridhost will send you all the information you need closer to the time,” said Nexus.
