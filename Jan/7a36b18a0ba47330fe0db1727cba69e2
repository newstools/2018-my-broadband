Twitter has disputed footage from filmmaker James O’Keefe allegedly showing Twitter employees claiming that people at the company monitor users’ direct messages. “We do not proactively review DMs,” Twitter told BuzzFeed News. It explained that a limited number of employees have access to such information and that Twitter enforces strict access protocols for those employees. Quoting senior Twitter employees who remained anonymous, BuzzFeed said the access is only permitted in response to reports of abuse. Most moderation is handled algorithmically, partly due to the volume of complaints Twitter receives.
