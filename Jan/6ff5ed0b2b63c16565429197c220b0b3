The DA has objected to the ANC’s recommendation of Rubben Mohlaloga for the position of chairperson of ICASA’s council. It said that as Mohlaloga was convicted of fraud this week, he is disqualified from serving on the council. “According to a statement released by the Hawks, Mohlaloga and three others have been found guilty of defrauding the Land Bank of approximately R6 million in 2008,” said the DA. “The three transferred funds from the Agri-BEE fund into a trust account and bought a farm for R2 million, as well as an X5 BMW and a BMW 118i for Mohlaloga, who was an ANC MP.” The DA said a person may not be appointed as an ICASA councillor if he or she has at any time been convicted of fraud, according to the ICASA act.
