FICS has launched a mobile app that captures photographic and other information at the scene of vehicle accidents to assist with insurance or Road Accident Fund (RAF) claims. It uses geo-location technology to automatically capture the exact time and location of a collision and allows you to manually record other essential information, such as registration numbers and damage to vehicles. Users are also able to take photographs of license discs and videos of the accident scene directly within the app, and can take down witness contact details and statements. Details that can be stored within the app include: The FICS app also enables you to make use of emergency assistance by providing emergency numbers you can contact from the app. The app keeps a capture history of any previous accidents, and you are emailed a reference number whenever an accident has been captured. “The app is the first in South Africa that captures vehicle and road accident data, and it allows users on the scene to ensure that accident data captured is available for any future investigations or court data,” says Gerhardt Becker, FICS Founder. “This is ideal for enterprise insurance companies who require accurate accident data to assist them in reducing their operational costs.” FICS is a newly-established group of companies for the insurance market, focusing on motor vehicle accidents and making use of digital enterprise and IoT to optimise the turnaround times of insurance claims. The FICS app is available to download from the Google Play and Apple App stores. For more information, visit the FICS website. This article was published in partnership with FICS.
