Kodak has launched its KashMiner Bitcoin miner rental scheme at CES 2018. According to the BBC, Kodak’s KashMiner programme allows customers to pay upfront to rent mining capacity from the company. The mining hardware for the scheme is provided by Spotlite and resembles a standard Bitcoin ASIC miner. Kodak plans to install hundreds of these Bitcoin miners at its headquarters and allow customers to rent their mining power. Subscribers will be charged an upfront fee of $3,400 and will earn monthly payouts in Bitcoin – which will vary, depending on the price of the cryptocurrency. Spotlite then delivers the Bitcoin earnings on a weekly basis through a shared account on Coinbase. Spotlite keeps 50% of the mining earnings and states that subscribers will never own the Bitcoin equipment.
