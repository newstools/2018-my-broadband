Netflix measured a net increase of 8.3 million subscribers during Q4 2017 – its biggest quarterly increase to date. “This exceeded our 6.3-million forecast, due primarily to stronger than expected acquisition fueled by our original content slate and the ongoing global adoption of Internet entertainment,” said Netflix in its latest results announcement. Average paid streaming memberships rose 25% year-over-year in Q4 and global streaming revenue growth amounted to 35%. It also achieved a full-year positive international contribution profit for the first time, and more than doubled global operating income. Netflix had an operating income of $245 million with a 7.5% margin, compared to $154 million in the previous year, with a 6.2% margin. It now has a global subscriber base of 117.6 million.
