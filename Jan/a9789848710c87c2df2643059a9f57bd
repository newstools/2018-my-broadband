Home Affairs launched its online Smart ID and passport applications portal on 7 April 2016. It was initially only open to South Africans aged between 30 and 35, but Home Affairs gradually increased the range of people allowed to use the website. By 25 August 2016 the eHomeAffairs website was made available to everyone. When the service first launched there were eleven participating branches from ABSA, FNB, Nedbank, and Standard Bank. Since then, FNB has moved its participating branch in Tshwane from Menlyn to The Grove Mall in Lynnwood, and has added its President West Street branch to the list. Last year, a message claiming to be a notice from Home Affairs was circulated online, stating that the green barcoded ID book would no longer be accepted as identification from 31 March 2018. However, Home Affairs has said that it has made no such announcement. While there is a plan to systematically phase out the ID book, the department said the green barcoded ID remains a legal form of identification. The ID book will remain legal identification until the Live Capture System is rolled out to all Home Affairs offices, it added. Currently there are 180 Home Affairs offices equipped with Live Capture systems, Home Affairs said. South Africans not near one of the branches listed below may visit a Home Affairs office rather than using its eChannel system.
