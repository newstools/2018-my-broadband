SEACOM has scheduled routine maintenance on its subsea cable system in the Red Sea. The company said all linear transmission traffic on the East Coast of Africa to and from Europe will be affected. The maintenance will begin at 03:00 on 19 January and end at 1:00 on 23 January. “This maintenance work will disrupt transmission on the SEACOM Subsea Cable for a limited period of time during this maintenance window,” it said. SEACOM will route traffic over its West Coast transmission links and to its Asia gateways during the maintenance period. This rerouting of data traffic could result in higher latency for South African Internet users, it said. SEACOM said it performs maintenance on its cable at regular intervals to maintain a stable international data network.
