Intel has asked manufacturers and users to stop installing patches it issued for the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. “They may introduce higher than expected reboots and other unpredictable system behaviour,” said Intel. “Over the weekend, we began rolling out an early version of the updated solution to industry partners for testing, and we will make a final release available once that testing has been completed.” Intel urged customers to maintain security best practices and advised consumers to keep their systems up to date. Intel is not the only company that has had problems with patches for Spectre and Meltdown. CNET reported that Windows suspended updates to AMD PCs when users reported their machines shut down and could not boot.
