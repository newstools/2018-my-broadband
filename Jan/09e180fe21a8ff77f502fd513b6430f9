Nintendo will shut down its Miitomo smartphone app on 9 May. It has stopped selling Miitomo coins, the in-app currency, and will offer daily login bonuses of Miitomo coins and game tickets. There will also be one final Miifoto event, with Nintendo encouraging people to tweet their favourite Miimoto memories. Nintendo said none of the app’s features will work after 9 May. Answers or messages will also no longer appear in the app. “You can transfer your Mii character to your Nintendo Account by linking it to Miitomo. Its personality and other information will not be carried over,” said Nintendo.
