Toyota has unveiled its 2019 Avalon, which is its first vehicle with support for Apple CarPlay. Speaking to MacRumours, the company said all new Toyota and Lexus vehicles with Entune 3.0 and Enform 2.0 multimedia systems will include support for CarPlay. CarPlay will require an iPhone connected via USB to the car’s multimedia system, and can be interacted with using a vehicle’s touchscreen. Toyota vehicles with Entune 3.0 will also be compatible with Amazon Alexa in the US. The company has not yet added support for Android Auto integration.
