Switzerland’s Economics Minister wants the country to lead the world in cryptocurrency innovation, ETHNews reported. Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said Switzerland has been on the forefront of innovation in many sectors, and it would make sense for the country to embrace cryptocurrency. He said it is too early to tell whether Switzerland would attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies, and that the country should evaluate their potential for economic transformation. Switzerland is a popular destination for cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiasts, and its canton of Zug is known as “Crypto Valley”. It is also a popular testing ground for blockchain projects, including the uPort identity management system built on Ethereum.
