Instagram recently released a new feature that allows user you follow, or have sent a direct message to, to see when you were last active on the platform. The new feature is enabled by default, but Instagram has provided a way to disable it. To disable activity status reporting, go to your Instagram profile and enter the settings section. On iOS this is a gear icon underneath your name, while on Android it is the menu button in the top right. Once in the settings menu, scroll down and toggle “Show Activity Status” to off. Setting activity status to off in the settings menu means you will also not be able to see the status of any followers.
