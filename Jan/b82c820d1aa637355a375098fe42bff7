Kodak has released footage shot on its new Super 8 camera. The camera is set to retail for between $2,500 to $3,000, and will go on sale in 2018. Kodak said the Super 8 camera will feature many of the original Super 8’s features, along with certain digital functionality – including a digital viewfinder. The Super 8 demo reel of footage is posted below, and shows the “film-grain” look users can achieve with the camera. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
