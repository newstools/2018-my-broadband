WhatsApp is set to roll out a spam warning feature, according to a report by Softpedia. The report stated that WhatsApp is testing a method to deal with spam, but it faces a challenge – encryption. WhatsApp’s messages are encrypted end-to-end, which means the company cannot see what a message contains. For spam detection, the company will look at how many times a particular message has been sent and the users sending this message. “Users will get a warning if they get what’s considered a spam message,” stated the report.
