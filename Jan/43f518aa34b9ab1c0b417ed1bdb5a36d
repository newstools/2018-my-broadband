Niantic announced that it will launch Pokémon Go in China, according to a report by the Financial Times. The company has not confirmed a specific release date for the Chinese market, but the game is expected to launch later this year. NetEase, which licenses the games of Blizzard Entertainment, will be Niantic’s go-to-market partner for China. Pokémon Go originally launched in 2016 and quickly gained popularity worldwide, resulting in server congestion and a record number of downloads. The game’s roll-out was also affected by its initial popularity, with Niantic staggering the global release of the game as it expanded its server capacity.
