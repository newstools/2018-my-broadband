New South African businesses can now register their company and its equivalent co.za domain name at the same time. This is thanks to a collaboration between the Companies and Intellectual Properties Commission, the ZA Domain Name Authority, and the ZA Central Registry. ZACR CEO Lucky Masilela said the arrangement enables new enterprises to protect their identity online. The CIPC will act as a conduit to the co.za domain name registration platform, and will not have the capabilities or benefits of commercial domain name resellers and registrars. “The initial co.za domain name registration with CIPC is for a limited one-year period only and registrants are expected to pay the same domain name price that is charged to all our other accredited co.za registrars,” said Masilela. CIPC-registered co.za domain names will need to be transferred to registrars, added Masilela.
