Instagram is working on a video calling feature for users who have an active chat open, WABetaInfo reported. Its report included a screenshot showing a video calling icon in a non-public version of Instagram. TechCrunch reported that Instagram declined to comment, saying it doesn’t respond to industry rumours and speculation. It noted that Instgram’s response to the rumour of video calling was different to the usual boilerplate they receive on unreleased features that are in testing. It is therefore possible that Instagram might not launch video calling in the near future, the report suggested.
