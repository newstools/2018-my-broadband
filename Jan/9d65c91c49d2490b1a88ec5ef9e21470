HTC has revealed its new Vive Pro virtual reality headset. The Vive Pro sports a redesigned chassis and improved display resolution compared to the original headset. The new head-mounted display also includes redesigned ergonomics, and features improved weight balance and adjustment options. HTC has also added a pair of detachable headphones to the Vive Pro, removing the need to use standalone headphones with the device. The Vive Pro boasts a 78% increased pixel count and 37% increased pixel density over the standard HTC Vive, delivering a sharper image via two 1,440 x 1,600 AMOLED panels. This increased display quality does come with a drawback, however, as gamers will need more powerful hardware to deliver high frames per second at this resolution. The new headset is backwards-compatible with the previous generation of HTC Vive software, meaning customers will be able to purchase the head-mounted display as a standalone product and use their old tracking devices and controllers.  Along with its Vive Pro headset, HTC revealed its Vive Wireless Adapter. The adapter uses Intel WiGig technology to untether gamers from their PC – removing the need for a cable connection – when playing VR games and is compatible with the standard Vive and Vive Pro. It boasts powerful video and audio transmission, running on the 60GHz band, and includes a Lithium-Ion battery which offers many hours of playtime on a charge. Latency is kept to a minimum on the wireless adapter, meaning players will not notice any input delay. This provides true wireless VR gaming, which allows a player to move around an area without worrying about cables. There is currently no pricing, launch date, or hardware requirements for the Vive Pro or Vive Wireless Adapter.
