Lenovo has launched a new Chromebook, the 500e. The device is a 2-in-1 notebook which features an 11.6-inch touchscreen on a 360-degree hinge, an electromagnetic resonance pen, and two HD cameras. Lenovo and Google have aimed the 500e at the education environment, and equipped it with features to make it suitable for learning. This includes rubber bumpers, and reinforced ports and hinges – which make the 500e MIL-STD-810G compliant and drop resistant up to 75cm. It also features a full-sized keyboard with a sealed touchpad. This lets it resists liquid spills of up to 330ml. The Lenovo 500e will be available this month in the US, starting at $349. Its specifications are detailed in the table below.
