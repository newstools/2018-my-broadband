The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has partnered with Blockstream to launch its new Cryptocurrency Data Feed. The feed offers real-time market information, consolidating data from over 15 cryptocurrency exchanges around the world. Cryptocurrencies tracked by the feed include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Ripple, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. “With the broad array of cryptocurrencies and exchanges, and given the price variances between exchanges, it’s critical that investors have a comprehensive source of pricing information,” said ICE. The feed will be delivered through ICE’s Data Service Consolidated Feed, which provides access to over 450 real-time market data feeds.
