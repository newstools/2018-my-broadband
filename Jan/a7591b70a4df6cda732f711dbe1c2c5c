Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced the social media platform will promote more news from local sources. This follows a decision to prioritise news from sources that are trusted by the Facebook community. “People consistently tell us they want to see more local news on Facebook. Local news helps us understand the issues that matter in our communities,” said Zuckerberg. “If you follow a local publisher or if someone shares a local story, it may show up higher in News Feed.” The change is rolling out in the United States, and will expand to more countries during the year.
