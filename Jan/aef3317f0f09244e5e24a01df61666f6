Plex has revealed its new Plex VR platform, which allows you to stream content to your Google Daydream headset. Users can access the service using a Daydream headset and compatible smartphone. Plex VR grants users the ability to watch their Plex Media Server videos in a virtual environment. Environments include a “fancy apartment” and a drive-in movie theatre, and friends will be able to join your virtual environment to watch content with you. Certain VR features will only be available to Plex Pass subscribers.
