Kulula.com has confirmed that its ticket prices will not go up following the implementation of an aviation fuel levy in South Africa. The South African government recently announced that the South African Civil Aviation Authority had amended its Levies Act. The amendment is related to a 16.4-cents-per-litre levy on aviation fuel manufactured, distilled, imported, or sold in South Africa. It is set to come into effect on 1 April 2018. The levy is payable by consumers, including a wholesale distributor, stated the notice. Kulula.com told MyBroadband that the levy will not affect its ticket prices. Susan van der Ryst, Corporate Communications Head at Comair, said Comair pays a Passenger Safety Charge, which means it is exempt from paying the fuel levy cited in the government gazette. “The fuel levy is a South African Civil Aviation Authority funding mechanism aimed at general aviation – as opposed to airlines and charter services,” she said. MyBroadband’s sister publication BusinessTech contacted ACSA and SAA for comment on the levy, but the entities failed to reply to questions.
