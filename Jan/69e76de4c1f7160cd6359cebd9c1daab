Facebook is testing the ability to post Stories from a desktop browser, TechCrunch reported. The feature will allow Facebook users to upload photos or videos, or record with their webcam and post from their PC. The company is also reportedly trialing a redesigned News Feed which prioritises Stories above standard posts. “We are testing the option to create and share Stories from Facebook on desktop, and are also testing moving the Stories tray from the top right corner to above News Feed, just like on mobile,” Facebook told TechCrunch.
