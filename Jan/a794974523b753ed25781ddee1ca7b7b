AMD has revealed more details about its upcoming Ryzen 2000-series desktop processors, including pricing and performance information. The Ryzen 5 2400G and Ryzen 3 2200G feature integrated Radeon Vega graphics and are built on the Zen+ architecture. Enhancements provided by this architecture include Precision Boost 2 and compatibility with AMD 400-series chipsets. To see how the chips stack up against Intel’s 8th-gen desktop CPUs, we compared the two ranges – detailed below. The Ryzen 3 2200G and Ryzen 5 2400G are similar to the Intel Core i3-8100 and Core i5-8400 desktop chips in terms of performance. Both the Intel and Ryzen chips also feature integrated graphics – listed below: The CPU specifications of the Ryzen and Intel processors are listed in the table below. AMD marketing slides published by Tom’s Hardware details the manufacturer’s CPU and GPU performance comparison with the two Intel 8th-gen processors. The slides below show the difference in price and CPU benchmark performance between the Ryzen and 8th-gen Intel Core chips. While Intel’s chips are more powerful in the Cinebench benchmark, they are also priced higher than their Ryzen counterparts.   Graphics performance is the biggest strength of the new Ryzen processors, according to AMD’s benchmark figures. Both the Ryzen 5 2400G and Ryzen 3 2200G offer decent gaming performance, with the former boasting support for many titles in 1080p. According to AMD’s data, the new Ryzen chips are slightly better than their Intel counterparts in graphics-intensive applications, while the Intel chips boast better CPU performance. Once third-party benchmarks for the Ryzen 2000-series processors are published, however, users will be able to view more detailed performance information for both chips.
