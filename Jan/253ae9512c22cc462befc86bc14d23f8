Today is your last chance to upgrade to Windows 10 for free, according to Microsoft’s accessibility support page. Microsoft has allowed Windows 7 and 8.1 users to upgrade to Windows 10 for free via an “accessibility loophole”. “If you use assistive technologies, you can upgrade to Windows 10 at no cost,” stated Microsoft. This was used by Windows 7 and 8.1 users who had not updated to the latest OS during the first year of Windows 10’s launch – which saw qualifying users able to upgrade for free. The accessibility loophole is now closing, however, and will expire on 16 January.
