Garmin has unveiled the Approach X10, a golf band that comes preloaded with data for over 41,000 courses. Golfers can see distances to the front, back, and middle of the green, as well as hazards on the device’s touchscreen display. The band will display layups, doglegs, and hazards like bunkers and water on all preloaded courses – which includes free lifetime course updates. This device will also automatically transition holes as users move from one to another. It will also keep track of stats such as greens in regulation, putts and fairways, and measure shot distance. The Approach X10 features a 1-inch display, is water resistant, and has up to 12 hours life in GPS mode on a charge. The band is expected to be available in January for $199.
