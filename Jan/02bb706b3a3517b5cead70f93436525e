Snapchat has unveiled Bitmoji Deluxe, a feature which adds hundreds of options to customise your avatar, The Verge reported. It includes new skin tones, hairstyles, eye and hair colours, facial features, and accessories. Users can take a self portrait with their phone’s camera and use it as a reference design for their avatar. Once Bitmoji Deluxe is live, users can access the tool via settings in the Bitmoji app, and tap on “Change avatar style.” Users can also do this in Snapchat by tapping “Edit Bitmoji.”
