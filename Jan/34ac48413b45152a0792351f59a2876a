Njalla, the domain registration service from The Pirate Bay founder Peter Sunde, has published its response to a legal threat from the New York Times. Njalla launched a page on its website titled About those threats, on which it published redacted copies of its correspondence with the New York Times. The move is reminiscent of Sunde’s time at The Pirate Bay. Njalla holds the registration for paywallnews.com, which the New York Times legal department took issue with – as it lifts content from their website and posts it on its own website. In response to a letter of demand from the publication, Njalla stated: It’s always good to communicate with people that in their first email use words “we demand”, “pursue all available legal remedies” and so forth. I’d like to start out with some free advice: please update your boiler threat letters to actually try what most people try first: being nice. It’s not expensive and actually it works much better than your method. Njalla went on to request proof that the New York Times legal representative is who they said they were. The publication apologised and provided the notarised letter Njalla requested, and again stated that paywallnews.com was stealing large amounts of content from the New York Times. In a lengthy response touching on human rights and the circular arguments copyright law ends in, Njalla used irony to disagree with the use of the words “stealing” and “theft” to describe what the website was doing. TorrentFreak reported that Njalla did not hear back from the New York Times after sending the response. “If they need help from us on copyright issues, they’re totally missing what we’re doing, and that they should look somewhere else anyhow,” Sunde told TorrentFreak.
