iStore has announced its iPhone battery replacement prices for South Africa. The company made the announcement following a statement from Apple regarding iPhone battery replacements in the US. Apple offers users in the US a battery replacement for $29, which is valid for the iPhone 6 or newer – regardless of diagnostic test results. Each customer can take advantage of this once in 2018, after which the iPhone must fail the diagnostic test to qualify for additional battery replacements at $29. If a customer wants an additional battery replacement, but their device does not fail the diagnostic test, the price of the replacement is $79. Apple said iPhone batteries are designed to retain up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 charge cycles. iStore said the iPhone battery replacement cost is R429.78 – including VAT – locally. This is iStore’s out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacement, in accordance with the Apple battery replacement programme. Owners of iPhone SE, 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, and 7 Plus who suspect their battery might need to be replaced should visit www.myistore.co.za to make a technical appointment, said iStore. “Online booking is essential. The in-store technical appointment fee of R200 usually applicable to non-iStore customers will be waived for this battery replacement programme, for a limited time only, provided that an appointment has been booked online.”
