MTN has warned customers of a scam which aims to access their one-time pins (OTP). Once an OTP is obtained, the fraudsters are able to buy data or airtime from the customer’s account and transfer it to their own number. MTN said it would never contact a customer via text, email, or telephonically to request their one-time pin. “This activity is a scam and it is not part of any MTN promotion.” said MTN. “Authentic MTN promotions are backed up by advertising on a number of channels, including through broadcast and print media, at our branded stores, on billboards, in the Y’ello Trader magazine, on the MTN website, and through our social media platforms.” MTN recently improved its security through the introduction of a fingerprint biometric solution, which is used to authenticate the identity of contract subscribers as they undertake a variety of transactions. “MTN aims to protect customers from fraudulent transactions that often originate elsewhere as identity theft,” said MTN.
