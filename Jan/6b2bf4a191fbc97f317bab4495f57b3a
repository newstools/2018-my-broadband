nChain Group has taken an equity stake in Centbee, a Bitcoin wallet and payment provider. Centbee is based in South Africa, and was founded by Lorien Gamaroff and Angus Brown. “Centbee will be rolling out mechanisms for merchants to accept Bitcoin payments more cheaply and securely than current bank payment systems, without exposure to price volatility,” said Brown. “We will work closely with merchants in South Africa initially to solve local problems.” “In addition, we will help consumers move money simply and cheaply across borders to support family and friends.” nChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen said Centbee has one of the most user-friendly Bitcoin wallets and merchant payment solutions they have seen, and has support for Bitcoin Cash. “It smartly embraces Bitcoin Cash because its bigger blocks, low fees, and fast transaction network represent the true vision of Bitcoin.” The Centbee Wallet will be available in the Apple and Google app stores in early 2018.
