WeFix announced it will reduce the price of its iPhone battery replacement service as part of a back to school offer. The offer will run from 24 January to 28 February 2018, the company told MyBroadband. WeFix will run diagnostics on iPhone batteries and conduct a battery replacement where required. This involves the battery being drained, charged, and its capacity measured. The announcement follows a statement from Apple regarding iPhone battery replacements in the US. Apple is offering users in the US a battery replacement for $29, which is valid for the iPhone 6 or newer – regardless of diagnostic test results. Each customer can take advantage of this once in 2018, after which the iPhone must fail the diagnostic test to qualify for battery replacements at $29. WeFix’s special pricing is detailed in the table below.
