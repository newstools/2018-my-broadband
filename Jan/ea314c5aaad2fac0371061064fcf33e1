TorrentFreak recently released its ranking of the top 10 most popular torrent sites for 2018. The ranking lists the sites based on their relative audience, and uses Alexa rankings as its basis. TorrentFreak stated that the Alexa rankings are not a perfect measure, which it acknowledges. “We also used other traffic metrics to compile the top ten. Please keep in mind that many sites have mirrors or alternative domains, which are not taken into account here,” said TorrentFreak. It noted that last year’s second-most-popular site, ExtraTorrent, was shut down. TorrentProject had also disappeared from the web. Torrentz2.eu, a newcomer from last year, was included in this year’s ranking – even though it removed all links to externally-hosted torrents. As its future is uncertain, TorrentFreak included an additional site in its 2018 rankings. To see how the torrent landscape has changed in recent years, we have listed TorrentFreak’s top 10 rankings from 2016, 2017, and 2018. A notable absence in 2017 and 2018 is KickassTorrents, number one in 2016, following the arrest of its founder.
