The Q4 2017 MyBroadband Speed Test app results show that Midstream Estate, Cornwall Hill Country Estate, and Country Lane Estate have the highest broadband speeds in South Africa. To calculate the average speed in an area, results from speed tests performed by MyBroadband Speed Test app users were compiled. MyBroadbandâ€™s Speed Test app for Android and iOS gives smartphone users the ability to test their Wi-Fi and mobile data connections. In Q4 2017, over 200,000 Wi-Fi tests were performed by iOS and Android users. The average download speed over Wi-Fi in South Africa was 11.59Mbps, while the average upload speed was 6.99Mbps. These speeds are closely linked to the average broadband speeds in the country, as most Wi-Fi connections are linked to a fixed broadband connection. The results show that Midstream Estate was the suburb with the highest average download speed, at 42.57Mbps. Cornwall Hill Country Estate and Country Lane Estate were second on 36.42Mbps, and Durbanville and Bellville third on 34.70Mbps. The table below shows the suburb results.
