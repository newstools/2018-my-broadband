Near the end of 2017, Instagram reported impressive user figures – 800 million monthly and 500 million daily active users. The statistics showed that Instagram is most popular for people younger than 25. This group spent an average of over 32 minutes a day on the app. For those 25 and older, usage is over 24 minutes a day on average. If you look at those usage figures, your first reaction may be to scoff at how the “youth of today” are wasting their time looking at photos of other people. Before you do that, however, check your own usage. I checked my Instagram usage on my smartphone – an iPhone running iOS 11.2.2 – and was genuinely shocked. My usage was at 3.1 hours on screen in the past seven days – an average of 26.5 minutes per day. To see how long you have spent on Instagram, or any app, on your iPhone, navigate to Settings > Battery, then scroll down to the Battery Usage section. Tap the Last 7 Days tab and then tap the little clock icon on the right side of the screen. This opens “on screen” and “background” usage times. It also shows how much battery the app has used as a percentage. Android users are also able to check their apps’ battery usage, depending on their version and device. On a Samsung smartphone running Android 7.0, navigate to Settings > Battery > tap Battery Usage, and select the process/app you want to inspect. It will provide percentage CPU usage figures for the app, how much data it has used, and power usage measured in mAh.
