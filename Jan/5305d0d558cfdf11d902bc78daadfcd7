Apple and Google employee buses have been rerouted following attacks that resulted in windows being shattered while travelling on the I280 highway, Mashable reported. Speculation suggests pellet guns or rubber bullets are being used in the attacks, but local police have yet to confirm this. At least four shuttles have been attacked between 12-16 January. Mashable noted there has been anti-bus sentiment in San Francisco, with activists blaming them for driving up rent in neighbourhoods that include stops for technology company bus routes.
