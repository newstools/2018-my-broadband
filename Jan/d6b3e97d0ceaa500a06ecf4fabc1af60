Hasselblad has released its latest high-end camera, the 400MP H6D-400c. The camera features a 53.4 x 40 mm 100MP CMOS sensor and a 3-inch high-definition touch display. Its 400MP images are made up of six individual shots, which are taken and combined using Hasselblad’s Multi-Shot technology. This produces a 23,200 x 17,400 pixel, 16-bit TIFF file for one photo – which takes up 2.4GB. The camera will go on sale in March for $47,995. A demo of the camera’s capabilities are shown in this image.
