Internet Solutions has partnered with Cell C to expand the operator’s LTE services. The companies stated that Internet service providers can now offer Cell C packages ranging from 50GB to 200GB per month. “Cell C is a leading mobile network operator, and its super-fast fixed-LTE network enables our channel partners to offer more options to their customers,” said IS. 30-day top-up packages – ranging from 1GB to 20GB – will also be available through IS’s integrated billing and management platform. “Cell C has an extensive network footprint in South Africa that includes 2,900 LTE base stations in the major metropolitan areas of Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Western Cape,” said IS. “With network speeds capable of up to 100Mbps, LTE customers can enjoy high-quality connectivity which meets the standards and demands of more intense online applications used by both individual and business consumers.” “Partnering with IS and their extensive network of channel partners allows us to reach a new segment of the market as we increase our broadband footprint across South Africa,” said Cell C CEO Jose Dos Santos.
