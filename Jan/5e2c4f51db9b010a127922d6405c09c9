Google has opened an office in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, reported TechCrunch. Shenzhen is known for its electronics and technology industry, and is situated near the border of Hong Kong. “We have many important clients and partners in Shenzhen,” Google told TechCrunch. “We’re setting up this e-suite office to be able to communicate and work with them better.” The office is not a fully-fledged campus and will function as a standard workspace in a leased office space. Google has existing offices in Shanghai and Beijing, and the company also plans to build an AI-lab in China.
