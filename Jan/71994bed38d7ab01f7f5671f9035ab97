Internet Solutions and Cell C announced this week that they will launch new LTE packages, available through local Internet service providers. ISPs will offer Cell C fixed-LTE packages between 50GB to 200GB per month, with 30-day top-up packages – ranging from 1GB to 20GB – available through IS’s integrated billing and management platform. Internet Solutions told MyBroadband that more information on the products, including the packages on offer, will be available from 8 February 2018. Resellers of the packages have yet to be confirmed, added the company. “The partnership works similarly to Rain – however, it is a Cell C offer through Internet Solutions’ billing and distribution platform. IS resellers then sell the packages to their customers,” said IS. Customers who sign up for a package can expect download speeds of up to 100Mbps in major metropolitan areas wherever there is LTE coverage, said IS. “Cell C has an extensive network footprint in South Africa that includes 2,900 LTE base stations in the major metropolitan areas of Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Western Cape.” “With network speeds capable of up to 100Mbps, LTE customers can enjoy high-quality connectivity which meets the standards and demands of more intense online applications used by both individual and business consumers.”
