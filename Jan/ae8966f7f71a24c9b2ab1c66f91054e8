Philips has launched SmartSleep, the world’s first “clinically proven wearable solution to improve deep sleep quality”. SmartSleep was designed following over 2.6 billion nights of sleep data collected by Philips being examined. “Nearly 40% of people ages 25-54 get less than the recommended seven hours of sleep per night, which is reported to result in difficult concentration, memory, and focus,” said Philips. SmartSleep helps users sleep better, and get more “deep sleep”, thanks to two small sensors that detect periods of slow wave sleep and intervene with technology to boost it in real time. “Philips’ proprietary advanced sleep analysis algorithms produce customised audio tones that enhance the depth and duration of slow wave sleep.” “An accompanying app logs sleep improvement over time and provides tips and advice on how to get the best possible night’s sleep.” Pricing and launch information has not yet been announced.
