Hisense sold around 390,000 televisions in South Africa during 2017, representing a 4%-5% increase in sales over the previous year. “We are selling more middle-to-high-end TVs in South Africa,” said Youbo Li, GM of Hisense South Africa. “Our premium UHD TV, the M5010 series, was more popular than the entry-level model.” Li told MyBroadband that the company saw roughly 25% US dollar revenue growth in the country, which becomes 14% growth when converted to rand. This is impressive, considering that the market in South Africa for televisions and fridges – Hisense’s biggest product categories locally – shrunk by an average of 8%. In televisions, Hisense leads the South African market in terms of the share of units sold during the last quarter. In fridges, it had the highest market share in terms of the value of goods sold. Li said they will do even better in 2018, with the majority of their growth coming from the rest of Africa and new product categories – like smartphones and air conditioning. This is possible, in part, thanks to its factory in Cape Town, where it assembles TVs and fridges. South Africa was the first country outside of China where Hisense established a factory, said Li. “We came to South Africa in 1996.” Now the group sees South Africa as a model for the rest of the world, he said. The China-Africa Development Fund is a 45% shareholder in the local factory, and it benefits from a strong relationship between South Africa and China at a government level, said Li. Hisense and the China-Africa Development Fund are also planning a capital injection into the factory for a second phase, which will contribute more jobs to the local community. Hisense further revealed that it is considering manufacturing smartphones at the factory. The factory is currently a 27,000 square metre facility and employs over 500 people on a full-time basis. It also runs training and social upliftment projects, which Hisense estimates benefits 2,000 people in the community.
