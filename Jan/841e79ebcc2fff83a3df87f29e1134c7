NASA researchers are considering the potential applications of blockchain technology for space travel. Dr Jin Wei from the University of Akron is heading up the research and aims to leverage the Ethereum blockchain to aid in spacecraft navigation and communication. In an interview with ETHNews, NASA’s Thomas Kacpura said this was the first time the agency was considering the application of blockchain technology. If the research is successful, it will be incorporated into NASA’s portfolio and used to optimise the agency’s communication networks, said Kacpura.
