Security researcher Abraham Masri has released details about a vulnerability in Messages for iOS. The issue causes the app to crash when a specific link is posted in a chat thread, reported 9to5Mac. Dubbed chaiOS, additional testing showed the bug also affects Safari and Chrome on macOS, with the link either causing the browsers to crash or display the spinning beach ball. Masri’s proof of concept attack appears to exploit a bug in OpenGraph page titles by creating a long tag. Until Apple patches the issue, users will have to delete any conversation in which they receive the link.
