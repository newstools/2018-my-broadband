Elon Musk revealed The Boring Company Flamethrower this weekend, and the company has already sold $2-million worth of stock. The flamethrower is available for pre-order for $500, although international customers may have to pay increased shipping fees due to the legal issues surrounding bringing a flamethrower through customs. The website states that the device is the “world’s safest flamethrower” and that a $30 Boring Company-branded fire extinguisher is sold separately. Musk’s Boring Company has undertaken a long-term project to reduce traffic congestion by boring underground tunnels, and has taken to selling branded products to raise extra funds. The Boring Company Flamethrower will start shipping later this year. Great for roasting nuts A post shared by  Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Jan 27, 2018 at 4:53pm PST
