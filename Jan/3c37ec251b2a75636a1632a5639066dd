The US Secret Service is warning of an ATM attack that lets perpetrators withdraw large sums of money. According to Krebs on Security, the attack – called a jackpot hack – forces an ATM to dish out large sums of cash. Diebold’s front-loading Opteva ATMs are the primary target, and attackers often dress as technicians to conduct the attacks, stated the report. The attack uses a laptop with a mirror image of the ATM’s operating system, along with a malware program. The mirrored OS is paired with the ATM after a “reset” button inside the machine is found and pressed. A keyboard is then attached to the ATM and its funds are withdrawn. The Secret Service warned that ATMs still using Windows XP were easy targets.
