President Jacob Zuma is not going anywhere, according to a report by the City Press. The report stated that ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte insisted that Zuma will not step down in 2018. This is despite calls for his resignation, and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa now at the helm of the ANC. Duarte also distanced the ANC from comments made by Ramaphosa that Zuma was “anxious” about his future. “Duarte has also dismissed talk of a pending shake-up in government, saying they were not part of that conversation,” stated the report. The report comes after weeks of speculation that Zuma would step down, following the positive effects of Ramaphosa leading the country’s ruling party. This included the rand strengthening to below R12 to the US dollar for the first time since 2015.
