After 10 years and several deadline extensions, the XPrize Foundation has ended the Google Lunar XPrize competition without a winner. “After close consultation with our five finalist Google Lunar XPrize teams over the past several months, we have concluded that no team will make a launch attempt to reach the moon by the March 31st, 2018 deadline,” said the foundation. “This literal moonshot is hard, and while we did expect a winner by now, due to the difficulties of fundraising, technical, and regulatory challenges, the grand prize of the $30-million Google Lunar XPrize will go unclaimed.” The foundation said it is exploring ways to proceed, including finding a new title sponsor.
