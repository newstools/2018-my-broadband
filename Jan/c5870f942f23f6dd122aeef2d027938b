WIRUlink will expand its wireless Internet coverage to outlying regions across South Africa, the company has announced. The fixed wireless broadband provider said its latest deployments areas include Heidelberg and Nigel. “There is no denying that the digital divide remains a reality in South Africa,” said Riaan Maree, Chief Technical Officer at WIRUlink. Maree said there is a need for service providers to improve access to affordable connectivity, including in remote areas. WIRUlink has earmarked other smaller towns as part of its expansion strategy, which will roll out during the first half of 2018.
