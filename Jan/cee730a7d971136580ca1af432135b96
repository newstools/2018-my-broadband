Qualcomm must pay the first instalment of a T$390 million (R160 million) fine levied by the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission for antitrust violations, Reuters reported. The company has to pay a total fine of T$23.4 billion (R9.6 billion), the commission said. Qualcomm will pay the fine in 60 monthly instalments. Qualcomm reportedly had a monopoly over the chip market for several critical modem technologies used in mobile phones, and it refused to license the technology to other players, said the commission. Qualcomm is also facing regulatory and legal challenges in several other countries, including fines in the EU for predatory practices.
