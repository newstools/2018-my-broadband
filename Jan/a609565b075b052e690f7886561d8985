Samsung announced that it will unveil a curved-screen QLED monitor with Thunderbolt 3 connectivity at CES in Las Vegas next week. Called the CJ791, the 34-inch display runs at an ultra-wide 3,440×1,440 QHD resolution and will offer single-source power and processing speeds of up to 40Gbps thanks to Thunderbolt 3. The Thunderbolt 3 interface offers up to 85W of charging power to laptops. This will allow you to dock your laptop to your monitor without extensive wiring, Samsung said. The company said users will be able to enjoy connectivity across an ecosystem of docks, displays, and peripheral devices including Macs, USB type-C laptops, and other desktop accessories.
