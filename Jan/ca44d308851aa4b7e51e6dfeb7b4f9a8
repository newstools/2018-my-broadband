Researchers from NASA, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the Department of Energy are testing a small nuclear reactor for use on Mars. The Kilopower reactor aims to generate a reliable power supply for a long-term habitat on the planet. Its compact size and durability means it can be transported to the surface of Mars, with multiple high-power versions required to power a large habitat. The Kilopower reactor has been successfully tested at various power levels, and researchers plan to conduct a full-power test in the near future.
