Afrihost has confirmed reports of slow speeds on Openserve’s network in the Johannesburg, Pretoria, and surrounding areas. The degraded network performance is due to a fibre break, which is affecting subscribers on DSL and fibre connections. “Our upstream provider is urgently attending to [the break],” said Afrihost. “We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may cause, and our team are working to minimise the impact to affected clients.”
