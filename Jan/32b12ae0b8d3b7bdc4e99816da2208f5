Sphero, known for its connected Star Wars toys, has cut its workforce. TechCrunch reported that the company has let 45 employees go as part of a restructuring move. A contributing factor to the move was lower-than-expected holiday sales, which the company has not anticipated. The company produces a range of toys for brands like Star Wars, Cars, and Spider-Man – and has its own self-branded creations. Sphero’s education division is performing well, however, and will remain a focus for the company.
