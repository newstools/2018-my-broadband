Civic CEO Vinny Lingham has shared his predictions for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash on CNBC’s Fast Money. Lingham said Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are currently aimed at two different markets, with Bitcoin the better choice for investors and Bitcoin Cash acting as a payment system. He predicted that the demand for Bitcoin as a “store of value” would be outpaced by Bitcoin Cash’s adoption as a peer-to-peer cash system. “When I look at it from the product standpoint, I think the greater demand is for peer-to-peer cash than for digital gold,” said Lingham. Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain which has implemented bigger block sizes to enable faster transactions, lower fees, and less network congestion than Bitcoin.
