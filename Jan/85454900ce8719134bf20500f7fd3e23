Apple will start taking online orders for its HomePod smart speaker from 26 January, Reuters reported. The device was originally set to release in the US during December for $349. The HomePod is around seven inches high and features seven beam-forming tweeters, each with its own driver.Â The tweeters have precision acoustic horns, and directional horns. The speaker also has a 4-inch upward-facing woofer with a dynamic equaliser to ensure the sound is free from distortion.
