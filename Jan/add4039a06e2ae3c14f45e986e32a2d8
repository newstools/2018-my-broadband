Reports that Apple will stop production of the iPhone X this year are untrue, according to The Investor. Recent reports stated that when Apple reveals its new iPhones later this year, it will end production of the iPhone X. This was said to be due to lacklustre signs of demand for the device. The latest report states that the iPhone X will continue its production run until at least 2019. It added that Apple will not launch three new iPhone models this year, rather only two. The new devices are said to be 5.85-inch and 6.46-inch units.
