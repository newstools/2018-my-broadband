Telkom recently extended LIT Music and LIT Video services to prepaid subscribers. LIT Music and Video offer free data for streaming from services like Google Play, Apple Music, and Netflix. Originally, users had to be on a FreeMe 2GB contract or larger to get LIT Music, and on a FreeMe 5GB package or greater to receive LIT Video. Now it is possible for prepaid subscribers to get data for music and video streaming through FreeMe Boost bundles, and service-specific packages may be bolted onto other services. Telkom said it plans to add more supported streaming services to LIT in the future. When Telkom launched LIT, it said they were able to zero-rate streaming data thanks to optimisations on its network. When LIT Video is enabled, streams are limited to 360p definition, and traffic will be optimised for that resolution. You will also be able to turn off the optimisation and watch videos in any resolution you like, but this will consume your normal data bundle. Telkom said the lower-resolution streams use a third of the data of a typical video stream. As with the contract-based LIT Music and LIT Video services, the prepaid versions are governed by fair use limits. The LIT Music and Video bolt-ons have the same fair use limits as Telkomâ€™s FreeMe 2GB and 5GB contract packages, while the limits on FreeMe Boost bundles have been halved. This is detailed in the table below.
