Chinese researchers have unveiled a plan to remove space junk by blasting it with lasers, reported Engadget. The scientists successfully simulated an orbital laser station which can influence targets by zapping them with bursts of light. By shooting 20 bursts of light per second at space junk, the orbital station can move the debris out of harm’s way or deorbit it and let it burn up in the atmosphere. The researchers concluded this would be a feasible solution to the growing problem of space debris. The construction of orbital laser stations would require international collaboration and careful planning, they added.
