Reddit announced that it has added two-factor authentication for all users. The feature has already started rolling out and all Reddit users now have the option to enable two-factor authentication on their account. Two-factor authentication is supported across desktop, mobile, and third-party applications, and requires an authenticator app such as Google Authenticator or Authy to work. To set up two-factor authentication, navigate to the “password/email” tab under preferences and select the “enable” option.
