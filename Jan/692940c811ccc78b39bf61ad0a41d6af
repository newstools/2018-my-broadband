When Apple reveals its new iPhones this year, it will reportedly end production of the iPhone X, Apple Insider reported. KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo stated in the report that the iPhone X has not done as well as expected in China, as the device’s screen notch creates the impression it has less screen space than the iPhone 8. At the end of December 2017, analysts lowered iPhone X shipment projections for Q1 2018, due to signs of lacklustre demand. KGI expects three new iPhone models to be announced later this year. Apple will still roll the technology from the iPhone X into other models, however, and will launch an “iPhone X Plus” model, it added.
