Owners of the OnePlus 5 are now able to unlock their devices using facial recognition. The feature was added in Open Beta 3 of the smartphoneâ€™s Oxygen operating system, which is available for download from the OnePlus website. Facial recognition on the OnePlus 5 works similarly to Face ID on the iPhone X, and can be activated by a quick tap of the power button. The latest version of the Oxygen OS Beta also includes a security patch, 5G Wi-Fi connection issues, and general bug fixes and improvements.
