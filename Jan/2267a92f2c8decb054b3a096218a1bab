Samsung has started mass production of the industry’s first 16Gb GDDR6 memory. The memory is for use in graphics processing for gaming devices and graphics cards, as well as automotive, network, and AI systems. The memory is built on Samsung’s 10-nanometre process, and the new chips perform at an 18Gbps pin speed – with data transfers of 72GB per second. Samsung’s GDDR6 memory operates at 1.35V, lowering energy consumption by approximately 35% over GDDR5. “With all of its improvements in density, performance, and energy efficiency, the 16Gb GDDR6 will be widely used in rapidly-growing fields such as 8K Ultra HD video processing, VR, AR, and AI,” said Samsung.
