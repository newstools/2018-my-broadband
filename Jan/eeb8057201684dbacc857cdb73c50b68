Uber has announced that its drivers in the UK must take a break after working for 10 consecutive hours, reportedÂ Reuters. After drivers have spent 10 hours transporting passengers, they will need to take a six-hour break until they can continue using the app. Uber has come under fire from unions and lawmakers in the UK, who criticised the company and complained that its drivers were working for too long. Uber previously stated that a third of its drivers in the UK are logged into the app for over 40 hours per week, and just under 8% are online for over 60 hours. UK drivers typically spend an average of 30 hours a week in the app, but Uber said it wants to ensure they are awake and alert while driving.
