Virgin Mobile has launched a “Data Boost” promotion, which offers new subscribers free data, on-net calls, and WhatsApp usage when they recharge. “All you need to do is grab a free SIM card, RICA it, recharge with R50, R100, or R200, and you will get the equivalent amount of airtime, free V2V calls, free WhatsApp and the equivalent amount of data for 3 months,” said Virgin Mobile. When the customer recharges with the qualifying airtime amount, they will receive the first month’s data allocation. On the same day of the following two months, they will automatically receive the qualifying data amount. The Data Boost promotion is only available to new subscribers, and will run until 31 March 2018.
