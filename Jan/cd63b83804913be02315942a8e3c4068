Craige Fleischer, the head of Samsung’s mobile business in South Africa, has turned down an offer to join MTN South Africa as general manager of devices. Samsung announced in November that Fleischer would step down, with MTN confirming he was set to start his new role in January. Fleischer withdrew his acceptance of the MTN position in December, however, and Samsung promoted him to vice-president of Samsung Africa – Mobile. Fleischer joined Samsung in October 2011 in a business development role, and was previously the South African regional director of Research in Motion, which became BlackBerry. Korea IT News reported that Samsung carried out 200 executive-level promotions in November, of which 27 were to a vice-president level. This was as a result of Samsung posting its best annual performance to date.
