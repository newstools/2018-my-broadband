Apple is reportedly working on an iPhone SE 2, according to industry sources. Softpedia reported that the new 4-inch iPhone will feature the same glass body as the iPhone X. This will allow the device to use wireless charging. The report stated that the iPhone Xâ€™s Face ID feature will not come to the SE 2, however, as its small size is a barrier for the inclusion of the required technology. This means a fingerprint sensor will be available for user authentication.
