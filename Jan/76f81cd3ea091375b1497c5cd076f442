MultiChoice has announced it will stop broadcasting ANN7 on DStv when its contract ends on 20 August 2018. MultiChoice made the announcement today at a press conference in Johannesburg, which was held to deal with controversies surrounding the ANN7 channel. While MultiChoice stated its board found that the company had made some mistakes, there was no evidence of corruption or illegal activity in terms of the ANN7 deal. MultiChoice said that instead of renewing ANN7’s contract later this year, it will host a new black-owned news channel. The news channel must be owned, managed, and run by a black South African company – free from any political or other interference, said MultiChoice. The decision comes after ICASA confirmed it will conduct an investigation into MultiChoice. This followed a complaint by the DA in November 2017 requesting ICASA to conduct an inquiry into payments made by MultiChoice to ANN7 and the SABC.
