Epic Games announced it will shut down support for Paragon on 26 April 2018. Paragon is a third-person multiplayer online battle arena for PC and PlayStation 4, which was launched less than a year ago. Epic said it would offer a full refund to any player for any purchase across any platform. Users can request a refund on the Paragon website. “After careful consideration, and many difficult internal debates, we feel there isn’t a clear path for us to grow Paragon into a MOBA that retains enough players to be sustainable,” said Epic. “As the player population continues to decrease, matchmaking times and quality will further degrade.”
