Hong Kong authorities have stepped up their efforts to warn citizens about the dangers of ICOs and cryptocurrency. The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and Investor Education Centre have created a public awareness campaign to warn users of the dangers of buying cryptocurrency. The campaign includes radio, print, digital media, and television adverts, along with educational videos. “The increase in media coverage and hype around ICOs and cryptocurrencies has aroused public interest. However, the public might use these as speculative tools without fully understanding their nature and potential risks,” said FSTB Under Secretary Joseph Chan.
