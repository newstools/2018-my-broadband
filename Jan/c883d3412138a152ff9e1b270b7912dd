Blockchain services firm Bitfury has launched a toolset aimed at combating criminal activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, CoinDesk reported. The collection of tools is called Crystal and was developed over two years in conjunction with US government officials. Crystal will aid users in identifying and investigating illegal activity on the blockchain, allowing users to check whether the address they are transacting with is related to criminal activity. “The industry needs some very user-friendly tools so that you can track Bitcoin transactions and see if an address you’re getting money from is green or black,” said Birtfury CEO Valery Vavilov. A light version of the Crystal toolset will be available to individuals for free, while the full paid version will be sold to enterprises.
