Kodak and Wenn Digital have launched the KODAKOne image rights management platform and KODAKCoin, a photo-centric cryptocurrency. The initiatives are aimed at empowering photographers and agencies to take control in image rights management. The KODAKOne platform will create an encrypted, digital ledger of rights ownership for photographers to register and archive work that they can then license on the platform. KODAKOne also provides continual web crawling to monitor and protect the IP of the images registered in the KODAKOne system. “Where unlicensed usage of images is detected, the KODAKOne platform can efficiently manage the post-licensing process to reward photographers,” said Kodak. KODAKCoin is the currency behind the system, which will allow photographers to receive payment for licensing their work. The initial coin offering will open on 31 January and is open to accredited investors from the US, UK, Canada, and several other countries.
