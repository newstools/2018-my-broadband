Hyper has launched a new Kickstarter campaign for its latest 8-in-1 USB-C hub. The hub – the HyperDrive USB-C Hub + 7.5W Qi Wireless Charger iPhone Stand – is aimed at MacBook Pro users, and easily reached its $100,000 funding target shortly after listing. At the time of writing, the campaign had earned $395,000 with 29 days to go on Kickstarter. Apple’s latest MacBook Pro laptops are slim and stylish, but only feature USB-C drives and one 3.5mm audio jack. This means that many users require a hub to use existing peripherals or accessories – of which USB-A flash sticks, monitors connected via HDMI, SD cards, and Ethernet connections are common. The 8-in-1 hub takes care of this by connecting to a MacBook Pro via a single USB-C connection, and provides USB-A, HDMI, Ethernet, SD, MicroSD,  and USB-C ports. What makes the hub unique is that it also works as a Qi wireless charger and smartphone stand, which can charge devices like the iPhone X. “HyperDrive is the only wireless charger that supports all four Qi wireless charging standards – 7.5W, 5W, 10W, and 15W,” said its makers. The stand on the hub lets users elevate the top of the charging pad so their phone stands upright while resting on it – displaying its screen at a similar angle to the MacBook Pro’s screen which it is attached to. The hub can also be used as a standalone Qi wireless charging pad. The HyperDrive USB-C Hub is available to back from $109 and is set to launch in May 2018.  The hub features the following outputs: Its dimensions are 130 x 94 x 25.8 mm, and it weighs 204g.
