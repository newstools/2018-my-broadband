Facebook has created a new ad policy that prohibits promoting financial products and services that are associated with misleading or deceptive practices. This includes binary options, initial coin offerings, and cryptocurrency. “There are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs, and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith,” said Facebook. The company said two of its core advertising principles outline its belief that ads should be safe, and that they build for people first. The new ad policy will help Facebook in its quest to ensure that people will “continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception”.
