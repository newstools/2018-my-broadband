Nissan has unveiled its Xmotion concept, which is a “design exploration for a potentially groundbreaking compact SUV”. The Xmotion concept has many features of a traditional SUV, including a high stance, bulked-up fenders, and all-terrain wheels. The SUV also sports a Human Machine Interface, which makes it easy to switch from ProPILOT drive mode to manual drive mode. The Xmotion concept includes seven digital screen portions, and the displays and infotainment system can be controlled by gestures and eye movements. Other standout features include a voice command system and fingerprint authentication to start the Xmotion concept. When the driver touches the fingerprint area on top of the console, a virtual personal assistant is turned on. After linking with the driver’s smartphone, the navigation system automatically recognises destination, weather, music, and vehicle system information. The Xmotion concept also uses a camera monitoring system in place of traditional mirrors.
