Samsung has expanded its mobile service van offering to Durban and Cape Town, following its launch in Johannesburg and Pretoria in December 2017. The company’s mobile service vans will repair certain Samsung mobile devices at customer’s home or office. “All customers need to do is call 0860 726 7864. The call centre will establish the repair type required and dispatch a van from the allocated service centre,” said Samsung. The call-out fee is R150. “Should additional charges apply, customers will be alerted by the service centre allocated to the call out.”
