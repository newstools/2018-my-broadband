Internet Solutions’ CloudConnect has been incorporated into Microsoft’s Azure ExpressRoute network. Azure ExpressRoute clients in Africa will link directly to the Microsoft Cloud – including Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics 365 – hosted in Microsoft’s South African data centres when they come online in 2018. “The ability to link directly and securely to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform locally will significantly increase the performance of our customers using Microsoft’s cloud services in South Africa,” said Internet Solutions. “We anticipate that this will encourage companies to move more of their workloads into the cloud, so they can take greater advantage of the benefits that cloud technology offers.” The company said the average latency between South Africa and London is currently under 180 milliseconds, whereas Internet Solutions’ terrestrial network latency is under 20 milliseconds nationally.
