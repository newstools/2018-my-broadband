Toyota has initiated a recall of 700,000 vehicles in South Africa, according to a report by Reuters. A Toyota official told the publication that 10 models, including Lexus, are affected. The reason for the recall is defective Takata safety bags. This airbag issue is not new to the motoring industry, with faulty Takata airbags the cause of multiple recalls across multiple car brands in recent years. Toyota South Africa has a recall page on its website, which “aims to assist customers with immediate information on whether their car is affected by a recall”. “Toyota SA Motors has initiated a recall campaign to replace Takata-produced front airbag inflators,” stated the website. An issue with the inflators can cause them to rupture, resulting in metal fragments passing through the airbag cushion material, stated the page. “Affected owners will be notified by a Toyota dealer to bring their vehicle in for the service action.” Owners can also enter their car’s VIN on the site, using the “Is my vehicle affected” search function, to see if they fall into the recall campaign.
