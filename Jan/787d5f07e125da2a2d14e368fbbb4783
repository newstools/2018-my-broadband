Otto Wireless Solutions, a leading wireless industrial connectivity hardware supplier situated in Randburg, has introduced their range of high-gain LTE Antennas, aptly named Ottennas, to the market. Otto Wireless Solutions has used their extensive experience in the industrial connectivity and IoT market to select and introduce these products to the commercial market. The first two models have been strategically chosen for a wide variety of customers, catering for industrial and commercial needs. By adding a small RF adapter, the Ottennas become compatible with many popular commercial LTE routers such as the popular Huawei B315 and B618 routers, and provide users with an immediate enhancement to their signal strength – leading to an improvement in download speeds and general wireless connectivity stability. The first models for sale are the directional MIMO, 11dB device (part number LTE-MD-11), and the Omnidirectional MIMO, 6dB device (part number LTE-MO-6), which are available online. Otto Wireless Solutions has also taken the initiative to ensure that the product is presented to the customer well packaged, with all installation instructions simplified and printed on the side of the box.
