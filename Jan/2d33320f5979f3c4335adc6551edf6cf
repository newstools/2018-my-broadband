Daily routines and the traffic on our roads returned to normal this week as schools reopened in South Africa. The first day of school was always special to me. It was the only day of the year when I wasn’t behind on my homework. To commemorate the special day, a quote from Epictetus, a Greek Stoic philosopher who was born a slave, is in order. “It is impossible for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows.”
