Nvidia has appealed to PC retailers to prioritise gamers over cryptocurrency miners. The company reportedly told German site ComputerBase.de that retailers should sell no more than two of the same cards per customer. This comes after demand for graphics cards from cryptocurrency miners has resulted in global shortages – including in South Africa. Nvidia said it is merely making a recommendation, however, and distributors and retailers will have the final say. “For Nvidia, gamers come first. All activities related to our GeForce product line are targeted at our main audience,” said Nvidia.
