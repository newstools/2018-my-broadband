Falcon Heavy will attempt its first launch on 6 February, said SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. SpaceNews reported that although Musk did not reveal a time for the launch, SpaceX has reserved a three-hour launch window opening at 20:30 South African time. The news comes after SpaceX conducted a static test fire of all 27 Merlin engines on the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle. The engines are split between three Falcon 9 boosters and generate thrust equal to about 18 Boeing 747 aircraft. “Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit,” said SpaceX.
