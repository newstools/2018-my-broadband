BMW has acquired Sixt SE’s stake in DriveNow, which the company said will help it become a customer-centric mobility company. DriveNow was founded in 2011 as a premium car-sharing project by BMW and Sixt SE. The service is used by over one million customers in 13 European cities. Its fleet comprises over 6,000 BMW and Mini vehicles, including the BMW i3. BMW said the growing field of mobility services is one of the cornerstones of its corporate strategy. BMW’s range of mobility services now include on-demand mobility (DriveNow and ReachNow), parking (ParkNow), and charging (ChargeNow).
