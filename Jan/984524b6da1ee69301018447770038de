The Department of Basic Education will announce the 2017 National Senior Certificate examination results on 4 January. The outcome of the matric examinations will be announced on SABC 1, eNCA, and the departmentâ€™s website. Matriculants will receive their individual results on 5 January at 12:00, except for those in the Western Cape, who will receive them an hour earlier. Apart from going to their school or exam centre, there are several ways learners can get their 2017 matric results. The 2017 matric results will be published in most major newspapers. Exam numbers will be used instead of names. Learners can send their ID number and exam number via SMS to 35658. Both numbers must have 13 digits to be accepted and there is a once-off cost of R3.00 to register. Once registration is completed, results will be delivered by SMS when they are released. Matrics can dial *120*35658# and provide their ID number and exam number to register. Once available, per-subject results will be delivered to users. Partial results will be made available on the Department of Basic Education website on 5 January. Students can get their results online using the matric 2017 results portals from News24, eNCA, and EWN.
