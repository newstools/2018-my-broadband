Amazon has revealed a Send SMS feature which allows users to ask Alexa to send an SMS using an Alexa-enabled device. Alexa sends the SMS using their mobile phone, which means that carrier charges may apply. The feature is currently only available to people with Android phones which run version 5.0 and up. Users who want to send an SMS using an Echo device must sign up for Alexa Calling and Messaging in the Alexa app. “Please note that text-to-911, group messages, and MMS are not supported,” said Amazon.
