The next update to iOS 11 will let users disable battery-linked CPU throttling, which Apple introduced in iOS 10.2.1. The Verge reported that Apple CEO Tim Cook said the update will be available to developers next month. “We’re going to give people the visibility of the health of their battery so it’s very, very transparent. This hasn’t been done before,” he said. Apple previously confirmed it slowed down iPhones when their batteries degraded beyond a certain point. “In iOS 10.2.1, we delivered a software update that improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns,” said Apple. “With the update, iOS dynamically manages the maximum performance of some system components when needed to prevent a shutdown. In some cases users may experience longer launch times for apps and other reductions in performance.” The same support for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus was recently added in iOS 11.2.
