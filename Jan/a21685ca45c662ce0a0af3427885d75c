Panasonic has revealed its new lineup of OLED TVs at CES 2018, reported TechHive. The new TVs will support the improved HDR10+ display standard to deliver improved contrast ratios, and the FZ950 and FZ800 models boast a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160. Both are also powered by Panasonic’s HCX processor. The panels also include an Absolute Black Filter, which allows them to absorb ambient light and reduce glare. There is currently no pricing information available for the new Panasonic OLED TVs.
