Michael Jordaan and Yatin Narsai will launch an app-driven bank that “offers added control and transparency”. Called Bank Zero, the new bank has been granted a provisional licence after an evaluation process by the South African Reserve Bank. “The 45% black-owned bank is set to launch in the fourth quarter of 2018,” stated the company. “Bank Zero will make use of a mutual bank licence.
