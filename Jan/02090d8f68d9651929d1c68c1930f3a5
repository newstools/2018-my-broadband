Coinbase has hired the engineering team from Memo.AI, a startup which worked on a Slack bot for technical teams. Memo.AI recently announced it failed to bring its product to market and would shut down. Most of the team has now joined Coinbase. “We decided to join Coinbase because we’re super excited about the company’s mission of building an open financial system,” wrote cofounder Mircea Pasoi. Coinbase is constantly scaling its infrastructure and engineering efforts to cope with the massive influx of new cryptocurrency buyers, and the Memo.AI team may help with this process.
