Walmart and Rakuten have reached an exclusivity agreement that will see co-branded Kobo e-readers introduced through Walmart, The Verge reported. Kobo was founded in Canada and sold to Japanese ecommerce giant Rakuten in 2011 – which rushed to beat Amazon to its local market with e-readers. Rakuten has made similar deals to place Kobo e-readers in bookstore chains, including with WHSmith in the UK. Its alliance with Walmart will also see the companies launch an online grocery delivery business called Rakuten Seiyu Netsuper in Japan later this year. Seiyu is a Walmart-owned supermarket chain in Japan which operates a grocery delivery service through local stores.
