Opera has added cryptocurrency mining protection to its mobile browsers. The protection prevents malicious scripts from hijacking a device’s resources to mine cryptocurrency while browsing. Malicious scripts can cause your device to run slowly and heat up, due to the increased workload of mining. The new security feature is activate by default when turning on the ad blocker on Opera Mini and Opera for Android. Users can check if their device affected by cryptojacking by visiting Opera’s Cryptojacking Test website.
