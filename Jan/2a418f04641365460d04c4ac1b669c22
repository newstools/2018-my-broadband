The FCC in the US has released a statement on its Draft 2018 Broadband Deployment Report, which includes the definition of broadband. According to the FCC, the benchmark speed for a fixed broadband service is 25Mbps download / 3Mbps upload. The FCC also stated that a mobile broadband service is not a full substitute for a fixed service. There are differences between the two technologies, including clear variations in consumer preferences and demands. “Because fixed services and mobile services are not full substitutes, it is important to evaluate progress in deploying fixed broadband service as well as progress in deploying mobile broadband service,” said the FCC.
