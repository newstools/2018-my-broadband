Land Rover has unveiled its 70th anniversary limited-edition Defender. The new Defender – called the Defender Works V8 – features a 5.0-litre V8 engine which produces 298kW and 515Nm of torque. The company has described the Defender as the “most powerful and fastest version that Land Rover has ever created”. It will take its driver from 0-100km/h in under 6 seconds, while its top speed is limited to 170km/h. “The V8 powertrain will be fitted to 150 specially-selected and re-engineered Defenders for the 70th edition, complemented by an eight-speed ZF automatic transmission with sport mode, uprated brakes and handling kit, plus exclusive 18-inch diamond-turned Sawtooth alloy wheels and 265/65 R18 all-terrain tyres,” said Land Rover. A lighting upgrade – including bi-LED headlamps – Windsor Leather interior trim, Recaro sports seats, and Land Rover’s Classic Infotainment System is also included in the off-roader. 90 and 110 wheelbase Defender Works V8 derivatives will be available from Land Rover Classic, with prices starting from £150,000.
