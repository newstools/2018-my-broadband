Johannesburg-based hosted telephony solutions provider New Star Networks SA (NSN) is looking to expand their IP telephony partner family. New Star Networks is one of the UK’s leading providers of cloud phone systems, IP telephony, hosted phone systems, and office services. The high-performance technology company has focused on growing through partnerships and is currently recruiting partners for the first quarter of 2018. NSN SA has been supporting its parent company in the UK since December 2010, after which the company has seen global growth. With the launch of their partner programme in the South African marketplace in August 2017, NSN has achieved phenomenal traction. As a partner of NSN, you will enjoy world-class service delivery, cutting-edge products, commercial support, and competitive pricing. The company is currently paying out excellent commission rates to multiple partners and has headroom to onboard at least another 70 partners in the first quarter of 2018. Partners earn as much as 50% of the margin on all recurring revenues signed through the Platinum Partner Programme. NSN also enables partners to achieve ongoing revenue streams with minimal effort or fuss, fully supported by their desk and field-based sales teams. On top of that, NSN provides funding to help you go out into the world, win business, and enjoy success. NSN also has special promotions on new handsets, flexible contracts, and new client sign-up bonuses on request. By becoming a partner now, you will enjoy being the first wave of lifelong Platinum Partners – among the first to spread the NSN promise across South Africa.
