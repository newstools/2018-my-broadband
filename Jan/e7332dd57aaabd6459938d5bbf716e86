Global branded motherboard shipments are expected to drop 10% in 2018, DigiTimes reports. This follows a continued setback experienced by the global PC market in 2017, with the PC DIY market expected to fall by over 15% in the coming year. The report highlighted Gigabyte’s significant drop in motherboard shipments over the past year, with the company shipping only 12.6 million units in 2017 compared to the 16.2 million motherboards it shipped in 2016. However, the gaming sector is still growing and is dominated by ASUS which owns nearly 70% of the market.
