Two law firms have targeted AMD for class action lawsuits over its products’ Spectre vulnerability. Firms Rosen and Pomerantz have filed suits against AMD for failing to disclose its knowledge of the vulnerability to investors. The public knowledge of the Spectre vulnerability led to a drop in stock value, the suits claim. Speaking to Tom’s Hardware, AMD said the allegations are without merit and it intends to defend itself. Hardware manufacturers are continuing to push out updates to protect users against the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities.
