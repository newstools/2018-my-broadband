Vox and its subsidiary Frogfoot have ambitious fibre targets for South Africa in 2018. With the demand for fibre high in the country, players like Frogfoot, Vumatel, and Openserve are expanding their networks to meet this demand. Frogfoot, which is expanding its fibre footprint in South Africa, said it has passed over 11,000 homes – a number which will increase. The company aims to pass over 33,000 homes with fibre by June, and 60,000 homes by December. The fibre-to-the-business sector is also set to experience strong growth, with Frogfoot aiming to connect around 10,000 buildings by June, and 15,000 buildings by December. The company currently has over 7,600 buildings connected, and 60 ISPs selling services on its network. While fibre growth made headlines throughout 2017, Frogfoot expects even faster growth in 2018. Abraham van der Merwe, Managing Director of Frogfoot, said he expects growth to accelerate this year. “With fibre to less than a million homes, we still have a long way to go and I would guess that we can expect the current number of homes passed to double in 2018,” he said. Besides the big growth plans for 2018, Frogfoot said it would like to see several initiatives takes place in the local fibre scene this year. This includes unrestricted access to buildings when deploying fibre and for landlords to stop demanding payment for access to their buildings. This essentially amounts to an unnecessary tax on connectivity, said the company. It would also like to see fibre spreading to rural areas, and for multi-gigabit FTTH services to be deployed.
