Rain Mobile plans to make mobile data much more affordable for South Africans. It will not do this by only offering cheaper data bundles, however. This is according to Rain Mobile CEO Willem Roos, who took control of the company on 31 December 2017. Roos told MyBroadband his aim at Rain Mobile is to build a business that brings affordable Internet to many South Africans. He said Rain Mobile will launch “innovative pricing tariffs” in the coming months, but declined to provide further details on this. Rain Mobile is currently running an internal Alpha trial, and plans to launch commercial products on a limited scale after the trial is complete. While the company previously said it may only launch commercial mobile products on its own network, it is not certain if this will still be the case. Roos said he could not comment on a potential roaming agreement with another network operator, describing this information as “commercially sensitive”. He stated that coverage is a challenge to a new network, and their initial focus will be on clients in metropolitan areas. “We are also working on ensuring that we have good coverage in high-traffic malls,” said Roos. While the full details of Rain Mobile are yet to be released, consumers can expect the company to address the following customer concerns: Roos said Rain Mobile will address these issues with the pricing tariffs they will make public at launch.
