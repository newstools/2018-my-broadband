Core Group has announced that Apple-authorised iPhone screen replacements will be available in South Africa for the first time from 29 January. The replacements will be available from iStore and Digicape stores. Authorised screen repairs use a genuine Apple replacement screen, ensure that full functionality is retained, and that the manufacturer’s warranty remains valid. Repairs will be completed within four working days, subject to demand, said Core. iStore Sandton Drive will also offer an express service where customers can have their screen repaired in one day.
