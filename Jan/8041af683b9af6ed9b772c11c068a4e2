Tag Heuer has unveiled its Connected Full Diamond smartwatch, which features an array of diamonds. The watch features 589 diamonds and a bracelet made from 18K white gold, but is otherwise the same as the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 smartwatch. It runs Android Wear 2.0, packs an Intel Atom Z34XX processor, and features an AMOLED screen, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, and GPS. Reports have stated this is the most expensive Android Wear watch ever made, and dwarfs the likes of Apple’s $17,000 solid-gold Apple Watch Edition.
