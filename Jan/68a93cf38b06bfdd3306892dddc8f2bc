Vivo has launched its X20 Plus UD in China, which it said is the world’s first smartphone with an in-display fingerprint sensor. The Verge reported that the smartphone is a result of a partnership between Vivo and Synaptics, a US-based sensor maker. The in-display fingerprint sensor technology provides opportunities for smartphone makers to produce devices with thinner bezels – and therefore bigger screens – without having to place a sensor on the rear of a device. The X20 Plus UD also features a 6.43-inch 2,160 x 1,080 OLED screen, dual 12MP cameras, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor. No international pricing or release date for the device was announced.
