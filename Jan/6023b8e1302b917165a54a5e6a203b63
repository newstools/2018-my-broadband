ICASA has confirmed it will conduct an investigation into MultiChoice. This follows a complaint by the DA in November 2017 requesting ICASA to conduct an inquiry into payments made by MultiChoice to ANN7 and the SABC. The payments were allegedly in exchange for political influence over the government’s policy on digital migration (in its favour). ICASA indicated that the matter has been referred to its Compliance and Consumer Affairs division for investigation. The DA said in a press statement it is “pleased that ICASA has agreed that the payments require investigation”. “South Africa deserves to know whether the payments were indeed above board, as MultiChoice has maintained,” said the DA. “While companies like MultiChoice should be allowed the space to do business and create much-needed employment, their conduct must at all times be within the bounds of the law, in line with business ethics, and in an environment where competition is not stifled.” The DA said that while there is no issue with companies lobbying for policy positions through debate, a situation where policy is bought cannot be allowed.
