Another adventure unfolds with the DJI Mavic Air Drone. It is foldable and ultraportable – the most portable DJI drone to house a 3-axis mechanical gimbal. When folded, it is as tall and wide as a smartphone. To maintain a low-profile, aerodynamic design, even the remote controller is foldable so you can take it with you anywhere you go. This sleek and aerodynamic consumer drone is for you if you want to capture new aerial perspectives: Take 12MP stills, 32MP sphere panoramas, 4K 30fps video, and even 1080p 120fps slow-motion video of your epic high-speed adventures. Use the SmartCapture feature to control the Mavic Air using hand gestures. It is fun, simple, and intuitive. For those who are after the thrill of the flight, the Mavic Air impresses with max speeds of 68.4km/h, advanced Wi-Fi Video Transmission, and even boasts a flight time of up to 21 minutes.
