Google is rolling out a new feature for Android 8.1, which shows users the speed of a Wi-Fi network before they connect to it. In the past, the signal strength of Wi-Fi networks was visible to users, but they did not know what speeds the networks offered. The latest Android update shows the connection speed under the names of the networks. There is an option to disable the service in Android if you do not wish to see the speeds.
