The Q4 2017 MyBroadband Speed Test app results show that Google smartphone owners enjoy the highest broadband speeds through their Wi-Fi connections at home and work. MyBroadbandâ€™s Speed Test app for Android and iOS gives smartphone users the ability to test their Wi-Fi and mobile data connections. In Q4 2017, over 200,000 speed tests over Wi-Fi were performed by MyBroadband iOS and Android app users. The average download speed over Wi-Fi in South Africa was 11.59Mbps, while the average upload speed was 6.99Mbps. These speeds are closely linked to the average broadband speeds in the country, as most Wi-Fi connections are linked to a fixed broadband connection. The app results show that Google smartphone users enjoy the highest average download speed at 21.48Mbps, followed by BlackBerry Android users at 20.62Mbps. The slowest Wi-Fi speeds are experienced by Vodafone, Hisense, and Huawei smartphone users. These results are expected, as Google and BlackBerry Android are high-end devices which are typically purchased by tech-savvy people. These people are likely to have high-speed broadband connections at home and at work, which is reflected in their high average Wi-Fi speeds. The table below provides an overview of the Wi-Fi speed results in South Africa.
