Samsung has sent out invites for its Unpacked event on 25 February, where it will unveil the Galaxy S9. As part of a teaser video for the event, the company promises “the camera, reimagined” for the Galaxy S9. Speculation suggests that it will feature a variable aperture camera, while Android Authority published “leaked specifications” on the back of a retail box. It stated that the S9 will sport a “12MP rear camera capable of switching between f/1.5 and f/2.4 apertures”. Forbes reported that the device is set to feature a 5.8-inch QHD+ display, and dual cameras on the Plus model. The camera will also offer a “Super Slow-mo” mode, which is expected to allow 120 frames-per-second 4K video recording. The device will reportedly feature stereo speakers tuned by AKG, bundled earphones from AKG, and headphone jacks.
