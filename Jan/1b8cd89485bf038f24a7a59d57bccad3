A new version of Google’s Chrome web browser – Chrome 64 – is releasing this week, and will let you permanently mute websites, The Verge reported. The browser will also introduce support for high dynamic range content on Windows. To use Chrome’s HDR capabilities, you will need a Windows PC with the Fall Creators Update installed and an HDR-compatible monitor and graphics card. Chrome 64 also includes 53 security fixes, including additional mitigations against speculative side-channel attack techniques.  Google has also introduced a feature to its advert settings that lets users mute reminder ads in apps and on websites that use Google’s ad platform. Reminder ads are advertisements for a product that you browsed for in the past. “We plan to expand this tool to control ads on YouTube, Search, and Gmail in the coming months,” said Google.
