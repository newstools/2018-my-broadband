Cotton On has launched a new ecommerce portal in South Africa, offering products across multiple brands. The online store features seven brands, including Cotton On, Rubi, Typo, Factorie, and Supré, and is designed to be mobile-friendly. When purchasing an item from the online store, customers can opt to collect the product from their closest store or have it delivered to their door. “With service like free Click & Collect, free delivery on any order over R500, and free in-store returns, our customers can ship with ease and confidence,” said Cotton On South Africa Country Manager Johan van Wyk. “It’s a competitive offer and one we know our customers will love,” he said. Cotton On has also launched its first rewards programme, allowing shoppers to earn points when shopping at any affiliated stores.
