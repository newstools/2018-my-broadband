BlackBerry has launched a cybersecurity product called Jarvis, which is initially aimed at automakers. According to BlackBerry, the motoring industry’s software supply chains create compelling use cases that Jarvis can work in. Jarvis is a cloud-based static binary code scanning solution that identifies vulnerabilities in software used in automobiles. BlackBerry said Jarvis is applicable to other industries, including healthcare, industrial automation, aerospace, and defense. Offered on a pay-as-you-go basis, Jarvis is customised for the needs of each OEM and their software supply chain. This includes the ability to evaluate new software under consideration as well as existing software in production. Once scanned, development teams have access to the results via dashboards with cautions and advisories. BlackBerry has started trialing Jarvis with several of the world’s largest automakers.
