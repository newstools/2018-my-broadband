LG has announced that its 2018 lineup of smart TVs will feature Google Assistant. Google Assistant will be built-in to LG TVs under its ThinQ AI operating system. In addition to using ThinQ AI to control TV-specific tasks using voice commands, the built-in Google Assistant will allow users to control other connected devices at home. LG said that its new TVs will be able to serve as a central smart home hub, similar to a Google Home. The companyâ€™s upcoming TVs will also feature a more powerful image processor with support for 120 frames per second content.
