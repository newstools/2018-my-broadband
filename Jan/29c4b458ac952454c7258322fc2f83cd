WhatsApp has launched a Business app, which lets companies connect with customers. The app is initially available for Android and will be available in Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, the UK, and the US. “The app is rolling out around the world in the coming weeks,” said the company. WhatsApp Business will allow companies to have a business profile on WhatsApp with their contact details, and feature quick replies to FAQs. Companies will also be able to review metrics like message reads. The app will also work on PCs, via WhatsApp Web.
