Thousands of users regularly use MyBroadband’s Speed Test App to test their mobile networks, and we would love more people to join in. MyBroadband’s Speed Test App is free to download and use, is ad-free, and allows users to test the download speed, upload speed, and latency of their Internet connection. By running a speed test, you also provide network operators with valuable insight into their network performance and where they can improve. To celebrate the strong growth of the Speed Test App, we are giving away R3,000 cash and other cool prizes to users who run speed tests on their mobile networks. To enter the giveaway, here is what you must do: Please note that mobile data used for speed tests on your mobile network will count towards your monthly usage allowance, and these speed tests can use a lot of data when testing a high-speed network. Good news is that MTN has zero-rated the MyBroadband Speed Test App, which means MTN subscribers will not be charged for the data used when running speed tests. The giveaway winners will be selected and announced on 5 February.
