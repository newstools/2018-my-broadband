Effective Measure has released its website traffic statistics for December 2017, which show that News24 is the most popular website in South Africa. Effective Measure is the official traffic measurement partner of the IAB South Africa and provides accurate traffic and demographics statistics for SA’s top websites. December is usually a time when website traffic drops significantly, as many people are on vacation and break their usual Internet usage patterns. December 2017 was still a busy time for many South African news websites, however, due to the interest in the ANC presidential elections. News24 attracted 6.3 million unique South African browsers last month, with TimesLive notching up 3.3 million browsers, IOL 3.2 million, and EWN 3 million. The table below shows the top websites, based on South African unique browsers. Only IAB-affiliated websites running Effective Measure’s tracking code are included in the table. Effective Measure also lists the biggest websites per category, with the most popular categories listed below. While Effective Measure provides a good overview of the most popular South African websites, it does not list international websites. Alexa and SimilarWeb provide an estimate of the most popular websites per country, but this is not based on definitive measurements as with Effective Measure.
