The final release of Linux kernel 4.15 has been delayed, according to a report by Softpedia. The release was delayed after Linus Torvalds announced the ninth Release Candidate in its place. “​I really wanted to just release 4.15, but things haven’t calmed down enough for me to feel comfy about it. So I’m doing an rc9 instead. I don’t particularly like to, but I like it even less releasing something that doesn’t seem baked enough,” said Torvalds. The final release of Linux kernel 4.15 is now set to take place next week, stated the report. The last Linux kernel branch to get over eight Release Candidates was Linux 3.1 in 2011, said Torvalds.
