GPD has launched its Win 2 pocket-sized gaming laptop on IndieGoGo. The device runs Windows 10 and sports a built-in gamepad similar to Xbox One controller along with a keyboard. The Win 2 boasts a large performance improvement over the original GPD Win, offering over double the frames-per-second in triple-A titles compared to the older model. The device can also be used as a conventional PC and includes display outputs for use with monitors. The Win 2 is available for pre-order on Indiegogo for $649 and is expected to ship in May 2018. The Win 2 can deliver acceptable frame rates in newer titles, due to its 720p display resolution. GPD said the device offers over 60fps in games like Dota 2, League of Legends, and Overwatch at maximum settings. The device is also modifiable and overclockable.
