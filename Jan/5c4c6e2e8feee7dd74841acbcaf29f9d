Malwarebytes recently published a protection update that caused connection issues for many of its customers. As a side effect of the web protection blocks, the product also spiked memory usage and possibly caused crashes. The company subsequently pushed a new protection update that should resolve the problem for most users. “If the update does not resolve the issue automatically for you, please shut down web protection, check for protection updates, and restart your computer,” said Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski. The cause of the issue was a malformed protection update that the client couldn’t process correctly. “We are going to overhaul how we publish these protection updates so that this never happens again,” he said.
