Epic Games, the creators of popular battle royale game Fortnite, announced that it will release an online gaming store to compete with Steam, reports TheNextWeb. The Epic Games store will offer developers 88% of their games’ revenue, as opposed to the 70% offered by Steam. Additionally, games that use the Unreal Engine – which Epic Games owns – will have their 5% royalty expense voided. However, the store will be open to games built on any engine, said Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. As part of this new venture, Epic Games will also be driving a support-a-creator program that allows game developers and content creators to connect, offering the former exposure, and the latter an income. Fortnite is one of the most successful PC games not to release on Steam’s store. Sweeney said that the company’s experience managing Fortnite’s heavy load of transactions will help them to run the new Epic Games store efficiently.
