Elon Musk stated on Twitter that Tesla would probably open a dealership in South Africa at the end of 2019. Tesla tweeted earlier today that 11 new Tesla stores are opening this week across the United States. Replying to the announcement of new Tesla stores in the US, Monero lead maintainer and South African cryptocurrency expert Riccardo Spagni asked Musk when locals can expect a Tesla store to open in South Africa. Elon Musk replied to Spagni’s tweet, stating that a Tesla store would probably open in South Africa at the end of 2019. Musk provided no additional information regarding the availability of Tesla vehicles in South Africa. While South Africa’s electric vehicle infrastructure is relatively sparse compared to Europe and the United States, major carmakers have begun to invest in EV charging networks to improve the proposition of buying an electric car in the country. For example, Jaguar recently announced the installation of public charging stations at every one of its retailers in South Africa.
