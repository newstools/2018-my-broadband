Cell C is giving customers 1GB of free data to apologise for network downtime today. “We want to thank our customers for their patience during the unprecedented network outage earlier today,” it said on Twitter. “To show our appreciation, we will provide each customer with 1GB of data valid for 5 days.” “We will notify you of when data will be loaded. Again, our sincere apologies.” Cell C’s network went down after the Neotel Data Centre experienced a power surge due to load shedding, which tripped the air-conditioning. “This resulted in the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) system, that enables the routing of traffic on the network, to overheat and power down.”
