Popular online stores in South Africa are listing the PlayStation 4 console as “out of stock” following the festive season sales period. Big retailers including Takealot, Raru, Dion Wired, BT Games, and Incredible Connection all list the PlayStation 4 as either unavailable or out of stock. Of the retailers checked, Makro was the only one with stock which was available to order online. However, the store provided a delivery time of 7-10 working days. A MyBroadband reader said he has also tried to buy a PlayStation 4 from several South African stores, including Makro, but the console has been unavailable this week. The apparent shortage affects standalone consoles, including the PlayStation 4 and Playstation 4 Pro, as well as console bundles which include games – such as the FIFA 19 and Spider-Man bundles. The shortages may be a result of Black Friday sales and other specials in the build-up to Christmas, with the PlayStation 4 a popular gift option. MyBroadband asked PlayStation’s distributors in South Africa for comment on the reported shortage, but it did not immediately reply to questions. South Africa is not the only country affected by console shortages of late, however. In October 2018, there were reports of the PlayStation 4 Pro not being available at many stores in the US – with even Amazon affected by stock shortages. Polygon reported that the best was to secure a Pro console was to buy a bundle deal which included games, as these were more readily available toward the end of 2018.
