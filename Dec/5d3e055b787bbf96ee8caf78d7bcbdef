South Africans can expect a big drop in the petrol price in 2019, according to the AA. The unaudited month-end fuel price data from the CEF is “showing a substantial drop across the board”. The expected price changes are: “The main driver of these reductions has been sagging international petroleum prices, spurred on by the USA which is trending towards becoming a nett exporter of oil,” said the AA. “Our outlook for 2019 is that South Africa’s economic fundamentals and investor confidence which influences the rand will be the biggest factors affecting fuel prices,” it added.
