Netflix has announced its first ever original series from South Africa, called Queen Sono. South African actress Pearl Thusi will star as the title character, who is a “highly trained top spy in a South African agency”. The series will track her on her most dangerous mission, while simultaneously following her changing relationships in her personal life. Queen Sono will be directed by South African comedian Kagiso Lediga. “We are excited to be working with Kagiso and Pearl, to bring the story of Queen Sono to life, and we expect it to be embraced by our South African users,” said Netflix. The news comes after Netflix recently announced that it was “looking at opportunities in Africa” for new content. Netflix said the series will begin production next year.
