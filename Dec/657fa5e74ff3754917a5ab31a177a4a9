Webafrica has told MyBroadband that it plans to launch new products in 2019. “We’re in talks with major infrastructure providers and plan to launch exciting new products in the first quarter of next year,” said Webafrica. These new products follow several launches for the company in 2018. This included Webafrica offering fixed-LTE services which run on the Cell C network. The fixed-LTE packages were brought to the market by Cell C and Internet Solutions, which are then sold to consumer by ISPs such as Webafrica. The ISP said that sale of fixed-LTE package running on Cell C far surpassed its “wildest expectations” this year. Webafrica stated that another highlight for it in 2018 was the successful separation of its business into two operating units. The Webafrica brand now handles all connectivity services for users, while its hosting services are now under the 1-Grid brand. Both businesses are based in Cape Town, said the company. 1-Grid, which was formerly called Gridhost, was separated from Webafrica earlier this year as part of its vision to grow into a specialised web hosting business for SMEs. Following its renaming to 1-Grid, the company said it will launch a refreshed product range for users.
