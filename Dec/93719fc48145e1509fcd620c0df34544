AMD recently launched a new, high-end GPU in its Radeon RX 500 series product line-up – the Radeon RX 590. This card is set to compete with Nvidia’s high-end GTX 10 Series GPUs, including the popular GeForce GTX 1060 6GB graphics card. The Radeon RX 590 – like other Radeon RX 500 cards – is built on AMD’s advanced Polaris architecture which is based on a 12nm manufacturing process. It is the most powerful Radeon RX 500 Series graphics card launched by AMD, superseded only by the manufacturer’s Radeon RX Vega GPUs. The RX 590 is more powerful than both the Radeon RX 570 and RX 580, but it is also more expensive. To help buyers determine which of these three popular graphics cards to purchase, we have compared their specifications, performance, and South African pricing below. Both the AMD Radeon RX 590 and RX 580 boast 8GB of GDDR5 memory and the same amount of stream processors, with the more powerful card having a substantially higher clock speed than the RX 580. The Radeon RX 570 is a slightly smaller chip which is notably less powerful thanks to its relatively small 4GB of GDDR5 memory. Below are the specifications and South African pricing for the Radeon RX 590, RX 580, and RX 570 graphics cards. To see how the cards stack up against each other, we used data from AnandTech’s benchmark database to compare their FPS performance in games. All three graphics cards are capable gaming products, and subsequently we compared benchmarks conducted using Ultra or Very High settings in both 1080p and 1440p. As the Radeon RX 590 was released some time after the two older cards, it has not yet been through the same benchmarks and there are subsequently some games for which a single card does not have a score recorded. Below is a comparison of the three graphics cards’ FPS scores in a number of demanding games. While the benchmark data above is not comprehensive, it does point to incremental performance increases as you progress up from the Radeon RX 570 to the RX 590. Looking at the degree of these increments, the Radeon RX 580 seems to offer the best value, with the Radeon RX 590 offering big performance boosts in certain titles, but very little in others. These graphics cards were once made extremely expensive due to their demand among cryptocurrency miners, but the opposite is now true. With miners selling their hardware to recoup their losses, adventurous buyers on a budget can opt to pick up some very cheap Radeon RX 580 graphics cards at great prices. Despite their relatively low prices, the Radeon RX 500 Series cards offer impressive performance and would be more than suitable for any 1080p gaming rig.
