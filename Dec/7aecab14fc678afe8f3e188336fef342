New Year’s Eve is a time for celebrating with family and friends, whether it is at home or out on the town. It is also a time when South Africans will be making many payments at restaurants, stores, and other outlets. For Samsung smartphone and smartwatch owners, this process is made quicker, easier, and more secure thanks to Samsung Pay. Samsung Pay lets users pay with confidence at almost every card payment terminal in the country, thanks to its support for Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) and near field communications (NFC). This technology lets users “tap and pay” with their devices, or allows their device to mimic a traditional card swipe. All of this takes place through Samsung and local banks’ secure payment ecosystems, with the tokenisation of bank cards in Samsung Pay ensuring card information is never at risk. Your bank and card issuer effectively generate a virtual card for Samsung Pay to use which doesn’t have an expiry date, or any other features that would allow a criminal to use it if they intercepted it. This is particularly important for holidays like New Year’s Eve, where you may make multiple card payments at a location you have never been to before – such as a restaurant or event. Samsung Pay allows you to leave your bank cards at home and let your smartphone be the only device you need on your night out. It also provides peace of mind that your card information will not be compromised when paying at a point of sale. Samsung Pay is available on the following devices: This article was published in partnership with Samsung.
