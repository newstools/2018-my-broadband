LG announced that it will launch a new capsule-based craft beer making machine at CES 2019. The device will be named LG HomeBrew and will work similarly to a Nespresso machine, brewing beer from single-use capsules. After inserting a capsule into the machine and pressing a button, the device will automatically do everything required from fermentation and carbonation to serving and cleaning. LG will also allow HomeBrew owners to monitor the status of their craft beer with an Android or iOS companion app. “An optimized fermentation algorithm intelligently controls the fermenting process with precise temperature and pressure control for guaranteed brewing success,” said LG. Multiple flavours, including American IPA, English Stout, and Czech Pilsner, will be available. LG said HomeBrew can produce up to five litres of beer in approximately two weeks, depending on the beer type.
