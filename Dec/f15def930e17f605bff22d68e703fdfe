South Africa’s Tari Labs expects the Tari blockchain protocol to be used by a new application in the ticketing industry. This application is being developed by Big Neon, and will use the Tari digital assets protocol to manage the issuance and resale of tickets. Big Neon’s platform will be open-source, allowing ticketing companies around the world to use its code base. Developers and entrepreneurs who are working on similar digital assets projects will also be able to use libraries, patterns and other code from the Big Neon codebase. Tari’s Riccardo Spagni said Big Neon’s use of the Tari protocol underscores his view that blockchain technology has the ability to deliver value to modern businesses. “It’s inspiring to be involved in the development of a digital assets-focused blockchain protocol that supports the needs of real businesses like Big Neon,” said Spagni. “By allowing digital asset issuers to create rulesets around their digital assets, the Tari protocol will empower them to make the best decisions that benefit all parties involved.”
