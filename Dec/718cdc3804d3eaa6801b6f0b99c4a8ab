Liquid Telecom announced that it is investing $400 million in network infrastructure and data centres in Egypt over the next three years. Telecom Egypt CEO Ahmed El Beheiry and Econet executive chairman Strive Masiyiwa signed the infrastructure development agreement at the Africa 2018 Forum. This network will be used to connect Egyptian businesses to the rest of Africa, and Telecom Egypt will also partner with Liquid Telecom to build data centres across the country. The signing of this agreement follows the recent completion of Liquid Telecom’s Cape to Cairo terrestrial fibre network. “Through its data centre offering, Africa Data Centres (ADC), Liquid Telecom is facilitating the growth of Africa’s cloud by providing a platform for cloud services to be delivered locally in many markets for the first time,” it said.
