Chipmaker Qualcomm is asking China to ban sales of Apple’s Xr, Xs, and Xs Max iPhones in the country, reports Engadget. This move comes after Qualcomm successfully secured an injunction against Apple’s sales of various older iPhones in China on Monday. Qualcomm alleged that Apple infringed on two Qualcomm patents regarding managing apps and editing photographs. As of now, Apple is not allowed to sell smartphones from the iPhone 6, 7, 8, and X ranges in China. Apple has appealed against the ruling, and continues to sell both the older and newer iPhones in China. Apple claims that the ban applies to devices running iOS 11 and earlier, whereas their new devices have been updated to iOS 12. Qualcomm’s allegations come after Apple accused it of unfairly increasing its royalty fees due to its dominance over the chip market.
