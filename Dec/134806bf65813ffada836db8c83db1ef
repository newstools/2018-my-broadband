South Africans have recently experienced the return of load-shedding as Eskom struggles to keep up with energy demands. Eskom’s energy output is insufficient for the country, and this shortfall is expected to continue for years to come. In fact, it will reportedly take 6 months for energy availability to return to stable levels – signalling an extensive period of energy problems for South Africans. While load-shedding presents many problems for businesses and individuals at home, its impact on traffic is often overlooked. Road safety organisation Arrive Alive has released a statement discussing how drivers can be safe when load-shedding takes place, as it takes down robots and street lights. The most important aspects to remember are: Arrive Alive also warned drivers to be on the lookout for reckless motorists who do not obey these rules. Drivers should also be aware that other road users may make innocent mistakes, and are asked to remain patient and polite at all times. “We are all annoyed with load-shedding, but we also have the same objective – to arrive alive at our destinations,” said Arrive Alive. Arrive Alive also highlighted the potential danger that a lack of functioning street lights can pose. Without these lights to assist with night-time or bad weather driving, it is imperative that drivers are particularly alert to potentially dangers. Recommendations include driving slower to allow for more reaction time, as well as using your brights if it won’t blind oncoming traffic. Arrive Alive urged motorists to be aware of their surroundings to ensure that they don’t fall victim to hijackers and “smash and grab” criminals, too.
