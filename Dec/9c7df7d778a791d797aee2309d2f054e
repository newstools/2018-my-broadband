A bug within iOS 12.1.1 is causing issues with mobile data usage on several iPhone models, Forbes reports. The latest version of the software reportedly causes problems with the use of cellular data, making it impossible for many iPhone users to go online without using Wi-Fi. While some users cannot use their mobile data to access the Internet at all, others are reporting that the software issue only interferes with mobile data in certain applications. A number of iPhone users reported that browsing websites works just fine, while connecting to the web through applications does not work properly. Apple is reportedly aware of this bug and is working to resolve the problem.
