Uber has announced a 5% price hike in South Africa, which will take effect from 7 December 2018. “While we have always tried to keep prices as low as possible, we need to be aware of the increased costs for driver-partners,” the company said in a statement. Uber said the change in fare prices will allow drivers to earn more in order to make up for the rising cost of business. It also said the new prices would allow Uber to invest in further development of technology features. Fares for UberX and UberXL trips are affected by this price change, although it is important to note that UberXL rides are not available in Johannesburg, Pretoria, or Port Elizabeth. Below are the old Uber prices compared to the new fares.
