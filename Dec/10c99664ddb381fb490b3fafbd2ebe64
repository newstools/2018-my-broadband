Microsoft is planning a major overhaul of its Windows 10 icons along with changing the icons for its Office Suite. The company unveiled its new icons for Office 365 applications earlier this week, but this is just the beginning of the icon redesign for Windows 10. Microsoft head of Office design Jon Friedman posted on Medium, stating that the new system would be expanded across Microsoft software. “It is a huge undertaking to build a common system and design 10 icons at the same time,” Friedman said. “Now that we have established the system we will start to scale it across all of Microsoft.” He added that the Office redesign is the first step in a major overhaul of Windows 10 icons. “Stay tuned, this is the beginning of a cross-company effort to update all icons in the same style,” Friedman said.
