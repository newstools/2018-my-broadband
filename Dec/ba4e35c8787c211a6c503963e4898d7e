Intel’s 11th-generation integrated graphics will feature over one teraflop of computing power, reported Engadget. This will let users play an array of games without the need for a dedicated GPU, it said. The new integrated graphics will be twice as powerful as the 9th-generation hardware, and provides roughly a quarter of the power of the PlayStation 4. Intel said the integrated graphics will be packed with its 10 nanometer CPUs coming in 2019. The news comes after Intel confirmed that development of its upcoming discrete graphics cards is on track and that it will launch its GPU products in 2020.
