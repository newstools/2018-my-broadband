The Bloodhound SSC project was reportedly shut down recently due to failing to raise $32 million to keep operations running. The goal of the project was to surpass the current land speed record of 1,228km/h in the Hakskeen Pan in the Northern Cape – but this now seems unlikely to be achieved any time soon. Expectations had been that the Bloodhound SSC would have begun running towards the end of 2019 in its bid to break the 21-year-old land speed record. The vehicle is now reportedly for sale for $320,000 (R4.5 million), but the project would cost millions more before it could reach a point where it could attempt the land speed record. One of the supporting companies for the project was MTN, and saw the operator setting up an LTE network in the Hakskeen Pan for the speed runs. With the project shutting down, however, MTN was asked about its investment in the area. “MTN previously supported and we’re willing to continue supporting the project,” said executive for corporate affairs at MTN South Africa, Jacqui O’Sullivan. “We met with the Bloodhound SSC team earlier this year to express our commitment to the project.” O’Sullivan said MTN cannot yet confirm that the project has officially been shut down, despite the project’s joint administrator Andrew Sheridan publicly saying as much. “We have noted recent media reports regarding Bloodhound SSC but we haven’t received official communication from them at this stage,” said O’Sullivan.
