Eskom announced on Twitter that it will implement stage 2 load-shedding once again today. According to Eskom, stage 2 load-shedding will take place from 9:00 to 22:00 today due to a shortage of power grid capacity. The power utility apologised for the inconvenience caused to affected South Africans. Eskom has also previously asked residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during load-shedding periods. This is the fifth consecutive day of stage 2 load-shedding, with a recent reportÂ suggesting that South Africans should expect load-shedding to continue for years to come.
