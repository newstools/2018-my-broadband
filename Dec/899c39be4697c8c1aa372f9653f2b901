Windows 10 has a built-in tool which allows you to inspect the health of your laptop’s battery. As outlined by Softpedia, laptop users can make use of an integrated feature to generate a detailed battery report, potentially identifying any issues with their device’s battery. Using this tool requires a use to have administrator privileges and access to an elevated Command Prompt instance. After launching Command Prompt, users can enter the following command (substituting “Username” in the file path with their Windows 10 username) to generate a battery report for their laptop: powercfg /batteryreport /output “C:\Users\Username\Desktop\batteryreport.html” This will generate a battery report and save it to your desktop, after which you can open the report in your browser. The report offers a range of information including technical specifications, design capacity, full charge capacity, recent usage, and battery life estimates.
