Absa’s online and mobile banking platforms have gone down, the bank confirmed in a tweet. Customers began reporting Absa online and mobile banking issues from after 11:00, with Absa’s Down Detector page showing a large spike in problems at this time. When attempting to log into the Absa banking app, users were told “Oops! We’re experiencing technical difficulties. Please try again shortly.” On Absa’s online banking login page, attempts to log in fail and customers are told that the server did not respond. Absa has released an update on why their system went down today. “We experienced a technical problem which resulted in several of our services becoming unavailable. We have resolved the main issue and we are gradually restoring services in phases,” Absa told MyBroadband. “Customers can make card payments and cash withdrawals in the meanwhile. We apologise for the inconvenience and are working as quickly as we can to restore full services.” Absa added that as of 15:00, it had restored all branch services, app functionality, and internet banking.
