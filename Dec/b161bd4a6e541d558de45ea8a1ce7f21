As 5G-capable smartphones begin to appear on the market next year, they will command a premium over 4G handsets. Speaking in an interview with Engadget, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau said he aims to keep this premium to around $200-$300 more than a standard 2018 flagship smartphone. Lau added that he would do his best to keep OnePlusâ€™s 5G smartphone priced at under $1,000. The premium of $200-$300 added on to the price of a flagship OnePlus smartphone means that a new 5G flagship from the company could be priced from $750 (around R10,000). OnePlus aims to offer flagship devices at cheaper prices than its competitors, so users can expect 5G-capable smartphones from other major manufacturers to be more expensive than this. Major manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung have not yet given an idea of how much their 5G smartphones will cost, but the higher price of the new components required for 5G capabilities mean that they will be notably more expensive than their 2018 flagship devices.
