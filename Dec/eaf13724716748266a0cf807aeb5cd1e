Microsoft’s new Chromium-based browser will support existing Chrome extensions, Edge project manager Kyle Alden said in a Reddit thread. One of the biggest drawbacks of the current version of Edge is its significant lack of extensions, with the browser only supporting some essential add-ons through the Microsoft Store. In addition to the the availability of Chrome extensions on the new browser, Alden also confirmed that current UWP apps which run on Edge’s existing HTML engine will also be supported. Alden explained that while these UWP apps will be offered through the Microsoft Store, Microsoft also expects to offer these apps directly through the browser. The first version of the new Chromium-based Edge browser is expected to be released in early 2019.
