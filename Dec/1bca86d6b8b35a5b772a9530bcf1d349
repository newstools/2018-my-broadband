Microsoft is working on a consumer version of its Microsoft 365 subscription bundle, according to job postings online. A job posting for a Product Manager for the company’s M365 Consumer Subscription states that Microsoft is building a team to create a new subscription bundle aimed at consumers. “The Subscription Product Marketing team is a new team being created to build and scale the Microsoft 365 Consumer Subscription,” the job posting said. “This is an exciting opportunity to define the target audience for Modern Life, understand the needs of our customers, and develop consumer value propositions that drive business growth.” The division working on the product is the same one which heads up Windows, Surface, Skype, and Cortana. It is currently unclear which software will be offered within the new Microsoft 365 Consumer bundle.
