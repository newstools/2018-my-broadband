Samsung’s next flagship smartphone might feature a notch on the corner of the device, Engadget reports. A leaked image of a Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus prototype (code-named Beyond 2) posted on Facebook – which has since been removed – shows the device with a corner-mounted front camera system. The smartphone pictured is reportedly a test device with a blockier design than would be sported by the final product, but the corner notch layout lines up with recent reports of screen protectors that accommodate the unique design. This leaked design also lines up with Samsung’s design strategy outlined at the company’s developer conference earlier this year. Samsung said its design strategy would see its smartphones adopting the increasingly-popular notched display design, eventually phasing out the notch in favour of a true full-screen smartphone.
