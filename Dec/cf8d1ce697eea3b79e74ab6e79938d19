South African professional gaming team Bravado Gaming has placed second in the Dreamhack Winter 2018 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tournament. Bravado moved to the United States earlier this year to play against high-level international teams and compete in bigger and more competitive tournaments. Since moving overseas, the Bravado CS:GO squad won the ESEA Mountain Dew League and qualified for Dreamhack Winter 2018. Dreamhack Winter 2018 saw some of the top international teams in the world competing, with Bravado taking victories against high-ranked squads including Optic and G2. Optic and G2 are the 13th and 28th-highest ranking CS:GO teams in the world respectively, and Bravado’s performance against these top international squads placed the South African team in the global spotlight. After an impressive run of victories throughout the tournament, Bravado was pitched against ENCE in the final of the Dreamhack Winter 2018 tournament. The team was beaten 2 – 0 in the best-of-three final, taking home $20,000 in prize money while ENCE took home $50,000.
