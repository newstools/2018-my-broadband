Intel is on track to release its 7nm processors in accordance with the company’s private roadmap, reports AnandTech. Intel has struggled to keep up with its plans for 10nm processors, which were expected to become widely available in the second half of 2016. Today, Intel’s 10nm technology is still only available in a limited number of CPUs, reportedly due to the company’s excessively aggressive targets for scaling and transistor density. However, Intel has assured the public that the failures of the 10nm processor are not holding back the development of its 7nm processors. “7nm for us is a separate team and largely a separate effort. We are quite pleased with our progress on 7nm,” said Intel’s chief engineering officer Murthy Renduchintala. “We are very, very focused on getting 7nm out according to our original internal plans.” The news comes at a time when Qualcomm has just announced its first 7nm processor for Windows, the Snapdragon 8cx.
