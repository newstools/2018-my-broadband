SpaceX has failed to land its Falcon 9 rocket on its landing pad at Cape Canaveral for the first time since it began recovering its Falcon 9 rockets. The rocket ferried a payload to orbit and began its descent back to Earth, but encountered some problems when navigating back to the landing pad near the launch site. A stalled hydraulic pump for one of the booster’s grid fins caused it to enter into a rapid spin on its return flight. The rocket was directed away from the coastline and out to the Atlantic Ocean, where it managed to recover from its spin just before landing safely in the water. Despite failing to land safely on its landing pad, the Falcon 9 rocket accomplished its mission of sending SpaceX’s Dragon cargo capsule to the International Space Station to provide the crew with food and supplies. A video of the Falcon 9 rocket recovering from its spin and landing in the Atlantic Ocean is embedded below.
