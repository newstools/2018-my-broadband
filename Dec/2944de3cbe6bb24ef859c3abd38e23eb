WeFix confirmed that it has shut several stores in the country as part of a process of “right-sizing the business”. The company made the statement following questions sent to it by MyBroadband. WeFix was founded in 2006 and specialises in repairing Apple, Huawei, LG, Samsung, and DJI devices. This includes smartphones, tablets, and MacBooks. MyBroadband was informed this week that several of WeFix’s stores had closed in various locations. Megan Quy, WeFix spokesperson, confirmed the closures and said that they were in the process of “right-sizing the business by closing non-profitable stores that are in close proximity to each other”. This was a result of over-saturation, or in certain cases the stores being situated in malls where foot traffic had decreased significantly. “Ultimately, though, we are just wanting to be in the right place where enough customers need ‘a good fix’, and that involves analysing traffic and making smart choices through consolidation,” said Quy. WeFix did not detail how many stores it has closed this year, but its website currently lists 24 stores operating across the country. MyBroadband also received information that Blue Label Telecoms is looking to potentially invest, through one of its subsidiaries, in WeFix. Blue Label is heavily involved in the mobile telecoms space in South Africa, and owns a large chunk of Cell C. It also own 3G Mobile, a business which specialises in distributing mobile phones to retailers. Blue Label told MyBroadband it has no comment at this stage when asked about an investment in WeFix. WeFix, however, confirmed to MyBroadband that it is currently in discussions with multiple potential new investors. “There is nothing concrete at the moment, and won’t be for the remainder of this year,” it said.
