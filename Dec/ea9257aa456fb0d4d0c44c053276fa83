Eskom has announced the implementation of stage 1 load-shedding from 09:00 to 22:00 today. This is the first time in a week that the energy provider has not implemented stage 2 load-shedding. Eskom said that this is due to an improvement in their generation capacity. Between 15 December and 15 January, load-shedding is expected to stop due to businesses shutting down. The tweet below details todayâ€™s load-shedding announcement.
