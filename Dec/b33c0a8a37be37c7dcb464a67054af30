Digicape, Apple Premium Reseller and business solutions provider, has appointed Gaynor MacArthur as its new Managing Director, effective immediately. MacArthur, who is one of Digicape’s founding partners and formerly occupied the role of Sales Director, succeeds co-founder and former MD Robin Olivier, who will be immigrating to New Zealand in early 2019. There will be a handover period, with Olivier remaining at the company in a consultant capacity, ensuring a seamless transition for clients and stakeholders. Says MacArthur, “Robin has an incredible vision and has played a key role in building the business, together with our other co-founders and shareholders. While he will be missed immensely, we are excited for the next chapter, as we enter our 20th year in operation.” MacArthur began her career journey at ‘Hirt & Carter Graphic’, which specialised in Apple technology and software. Starting in an entry-level position, MacArthur studied Computer Graphics after hours to increase her knowledge in the field, working her way up to the role of trainer, and later Training Manager. Discovering a deep-seated passion for the fast-paced, target-driven nature of the business’ sales function, MacArthur later moved to the Sales department. MacArthur continued to rise rapidly through the ranks, occupying the position of Sales Manager and ultimately Sales Director at Hirt & Carter Graphic. Several years later, MacArthur decided to start her own venture together with several former colleagues, and Digicape was born. MacArthur fulfilled the role of Sales Director at Digicape, where she was responsible for implementing an effective sales strategy and meeting Apple’s stringent targets, before stepping into her current role as MD. Says MacArthur of her plans for Digicape; “We have always had a very strong foundation in technical expertise and service, and we pride ourselves on offering our clients complete business solutions; products and software that not only streamline operations and enhance day-to-day productivity, but which also solve a particular business challenge. “I look forward to expanding on the traction we’ve gained in the b2b vertical, while continuing to offer our retail clients premium products and unrivalled service.” This article was published in partnership with Digicape.
