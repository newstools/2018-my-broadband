Tesla Powerwall battery units are selling as fast as they land in South Africa, and it may be a long time before they are readily available in the country, Rubicon sales director Greg Blandford has told MyBroadband. Rubicon is an authorised Tesla Energy distributor for South Africa. While Powerwalls are like hen’s teeth in South Africa, Blandford said there are several alternatives South Africans can choose for their solar power  and “off-the-grid” systems, or to just help take the sting out of load-shedding. Recent reports suggest that load-shedding will continue until at least March next year, with some commentators warning that years of electricity problems lie ahead for South Africa. Eskom is suffering from a lack of skills, a legacy of deferred maintenance, and is feeling the repercussions of using poor quality coal. There are also a multitude of other problems plaguing individual power stations, which have resulted in almost 17.4 gigawatts (38%) of Eskom’s total generation capacity being offline. Blandford said they are offering several types of battery backup and solar kits that have become popular since Eskom started load shedding again.      Rubicon provided the following graphics to illustrate how its Synapse-based systems work.
