Tesla may reveal an electric bakkie prototype in 2019, according to CEO Elon Musk. “I’m dying to make a pickup truck so bad… we might have a prototype to unveil next year,” Musk said on Twitter. Musk has previously mentioned that he would like to produce a Tesla bakkie, stating in April 2017 that he would like to unveil a bakkie in 18-24 months. Additionally, Musk asked Tesla fans what features they would like to see in a Tesla pickup truck in a tweet earlier this year, gauging interest in the concept of an electric bakkie. This follows a recent tweet by Musk which pointed to the possible opening of a Tesla dealership in South Africa at the end of 2019.
