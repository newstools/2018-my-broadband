Microsoft is giving up on its default Edge browser for Windows 10 and is working on replacing it with a Chromium-based alternative, WindowsCentral reports. The Edge browser was designed using Microsoft’s own EdgeHTML engine, which it will now reportedly drop in favour of Google’s Chromium engine, which powers the Chrome browser. According to the report, this new browser is code-named “Anaheim” and will replace Microsoft Edge as the default browser for Windows 10. There is no information regarding a re-branding or change in user interface which may accompany this switch in rendering engine, but the adoption of Chromium should ensure that Windows 10’s default browser works just as well as Google Chrome across web applications. Microsoft has struggled to get Windows 10 users to keep Edge as their default browser, even going so far as to post pleas to try the browser out when navigating to the Chrome download page or changing the default browser.
