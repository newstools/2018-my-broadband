Zando has issued an apology to customers apologising for the delay in sending out orders and answering customer calls. Zando posted the apology on its Facebook page, and said it understands customers are frustrated by the problems. “However, be assured that our warehouse and customer service teams are working tirelessly to ensure that we deliver on our promise.” The apology comes as multiple Zando customers have contacted MyBroadband complaining that their Black Friday 2018 orders have not been delivered. Users have also taken to Zando’s Facebook page to complain about their orders not being delivered. This included hundreds of comments in reply to Zando’s apology, with customers telling the company to get their act together and that they have been waiting for long periods for orders. Following the completion of its Black Friday sale in November, Zando stated that it had increased its trading volumes compared to 2017. Mobile sales reached 67% of total sales, up from 52% from last year, it said at the time. “By midday on Black Friday, Zando had already exceeded the total order volume of last year’s entire Black Friday.” Zando added that it ensured 100% uptime on its website, and that the top-selling categories were sneakers, womenswear, and shoes. Zando was asked for comment on why its deliveries were delayed and how many orders were outstanding, but the company did not reply to questions.
