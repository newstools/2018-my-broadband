Huawei shipped over 200 million smartphones this year, breaking the company’s record, reports Engadget. By comparison, Huawei shipped 153 million mobile phones last year. Huawei released numerous successful smartphones over the course of 2018 that were key to this growth. The P20 and Mate 20 smartphones shipped 16 million and 5 million devices respectively, while over 65 million mid-range Nova devices were shipped this year. Huawei has also touted the performance of its Honor range over the course of 2018. The superb performance of Huawei’s smartphones this year stands in stark contrast with rival company Apple, who has struggled to sell their new iPhones. Huawei continues to grow a substantial international market share, despite the USA’s moves in opposition to the tech giant.
