Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou has been arrested and faces extradition to the USA due to allegations she violated the latter’s trade sanctions against Iran, reports The Globe and Mail. Wanzhou, who is also the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested on Saturday, and her bail hearing will take place tomorrow. “She is sought for extradition by the United States,” said US justice department spokesperson Ian McLeod. “As there is a publication ban in effect, we cannot provide any further detail at this time.” New York prosecutors have been investigating the alleged violations, which were first reported in April. “The company has been provided with very little information regarding the charges and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng,” said Huawei in a statement. “The company believes the Canadian and US legal systems will ultimately reach a just conclusion.” The USA has previously expressed its concerns regarding the possibility that Huawei may use its equipment to spy on American citizens.
