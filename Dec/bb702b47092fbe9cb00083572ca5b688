The latest MyBroadband Android Speed Test app results show that mobile broadband users in Gauteng enjoy higher speeds than their counterparts in other areas. In November, MyBroadband speed test app users conducted 147,258 upload, download, and latency tests across the country. These results provide a good overview of the network performance of Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, Telkom, and Rain across South Africa. As part of this research, MyBroadband looked at the average performance of the different mobile networks at a suburb level. What emerged is that mobile users in Gauteng, Cape Town, and Durban enjoy significantly higher speeds than those in rural areas. This, however, is not surprising as the latest network technologies are typically deployed in metropolitan areas first. There were some exceptions. MTN subscribers in Bloemfontein and Paarl enjoy higher average speeds than most people in large cities. Hartbeespoort is another area which produced higher average speeds than most suburbs in large cities. The tables below provides an overview of the suburbs with the highest average speed for each mobile network.
