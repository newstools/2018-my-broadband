Netflix is testing an instant replay feature which would offer viewers the opportunity to replay a scene, the company told the LA Times. The feature will allow users to pause a movie or TV show and re-watch a scene at the touch of a button. According to the report, this instant replay functionality is currently only available within certain Netflix content, and presents viewers with a prompt to rewatch a memorable scene. The company added that this feature is currently in testing and it may not be rolled out in the future. Certain viewers have expressed frustration at the sudden appearance of “watch that scene again” pop-ups however, taking to social media to vent their feelings.
