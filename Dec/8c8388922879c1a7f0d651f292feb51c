Eskom has implemented stage 2 load-shedding, which will run from 08:00 and “is likely to continue until 22:00”. “Eskom would like to sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and uncertainty caused by this,” it said. “Generation plant continues to be out on planned maintenance (approximately 5,000MW) and there is a higher than expected number of units (currently at approximately 10,000MW) on unplanned maintenance due to technical faults,” said Eskom. “Over and above these challenges, we are experiencing low diesel reserves due to the continued pressure on the national grid resulting in excessive usage of open-cycle gas turbines.” Eskom asked residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period.
