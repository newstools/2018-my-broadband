Cell C’s network went down earlier today, and the company took to Twitter to inform their customers that the outage was due to load-shedding. The outage extended to users in various provinces, including Gauteng, the Western Cape, and Mpumalanga. Cell C explained to MyBroadband the specifics of why their network went down. “Cell C has identified the fault that affected data and voice services on its network for approximately 2 hours on Saturday,” said Cell C. “The Neotel Data Centre experienced a power surge due to load shedding, which tripped the air-conditioning. This resulted in the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) system, that enables the routing of traffic on the network, to overheat and power down.” Cell C added that they have deployed additional generators, and that their equipment has been restored. “Customers are urged to restart their devices as service restoration is in process. Cell C again apologises for the inconvenience and thanks its customers for their patience.”
