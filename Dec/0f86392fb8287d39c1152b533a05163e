Reviews for the PlayStation Classic are coming in and it’s not looking good for Sony’s latest console. Engadget reviewer Devindra Hardawar has labeled the console a “mistake”, adding that it “betrays the memory of the original PlayStation”. Other complaints from Hardawar include “lackluster” emulation quality, a lack of DualShock, and no AC adapter. GameSpot writer Peter Brown warns buyers to “prepare for disappointment”, adding that users would enjoy emulating old games on newer consoles like the PlayStation 3 more than using the PlayStation Classic. He added that the console features poor image stretching – making images even more ugly than they already are due to their age – as well as frame rate issues. The Guardian reviewer Keith Stuart adds that while the PlayStation Classic can offer some fun, the functionality is “bare-bones” and “all the swagger is gone” from the experience of playing these old games. The PlayStation Classic is incredibly easy to hack, although this may end up being to the console’s benefit, as hacks and projects have begun bringing other classic games to the console.
