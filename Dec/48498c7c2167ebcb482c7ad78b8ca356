MultiChoice reported that between April and September it contributed over a billion rand to South Africa’s local entertainment industry, and R682 million to local sports. This represents an increase of 8% in local entertainment production contributions compared to the same period last year, and a 9% decrease in local sports production. “Investing in the local production industry remains an imperative for MultiChoice,” the company stated in Naspers’ interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2018. Mzansi Magic is still one of M-Net’s most popular channels, featuring weekday telenovelas, Sunday-night drama, and reality shows driving appointment viewing. MultiChoice said that the M-Net channel (DStv 101) continues to be an important channel for Premium subscribers, which includes a schedule of first and exclusive international series, as well as a local content slate that has continued to drive viewership. “Both local and international content is key to viewership success, and we look forward to the next local venture, The Girl from St Agnes, which started filming in October 2018,” MultiChoice said. SuperSport also acquired rights to the Serie A Italian Football League and the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) franchises. “Other notable broadcast rights extended include the UEFA Champions League, the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Masters Golf Tournament,” MultiChoice said. It added that SuperSport hosted a successful broadcast of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, with viewership increasing significantly across both the Compact and Premium packages where all 64 matches were broadcast in high definition. “The 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup takes place in Japan in October 2019 and SuperSport has been selected as one of four main broadcasters of the event to audiences across the world,” MultiChoice said.
