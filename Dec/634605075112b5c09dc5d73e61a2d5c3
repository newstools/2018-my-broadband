MyBroadband’s November 2018 Internet service provider rankings reveal that Cybersmart is the top-rated service provider in South Africa. The ISP rankings are based on thousands of consumer ratings on the MyBroadband Speed Test platform. MyBroadband’s HTML5 speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure a neutral testing environment. Many of the users who perform speed tests also rate the service which they receive from their ISP on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. The November 2018 results show that Cybersmart is the top-rated ISP, with a score of 4.50, followed closely by Cool Ideas on 4.27, and BitCo on 4.08. Cybersmart’s good performance is not unexpected, considering its recent moves in the market. The company recently upgraded all its Lightspeed users to 500Mbps for free, and also offers the most affordable fibre connectivity in South Africa. The table below provides an overview of the ratings of South Africa’s top ISPs.
