The inaugural South African Gaming Awards will be hosted at Comic Con Africa 2019. These awards have been established to celebrate individuals, teams, developers, streamers, and journalists in the gaming industry. “We came to the realisation that there is no platform of this nature on the African continent where those who are excelling in the gaming industry have an opportunity to be acknowledged,” said Carol Weaving, MD of Reed Exhibitions. Weaving added that the goal was to bring like-minded individuals together to celebrate the gaming industry, while simultaneously building the South African gaming community. Comic Con Africa 2019 will take place from 21-24 September 2019.
