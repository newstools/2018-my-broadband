The Portfolio Committee on Communications has received a letter from President Cyril Ramaphosa in which the president formally accepted the resignation of four non-executive board members of the SABC. The resignations of Khanyisile Kweyama, John Matisonn, Krish Naidoo, and Mathatha Tsedu come at a time when the portfolio committee was filling four other vacancies, and the combined eight vacancies leave the SABC board without a quorum. Committee chairperson Hlengiwe Mkhize said that the committee will use the existing advertisement for the initial four vacancies to fill all eight vacancies. Mkhize also highlighted the committee’s belief that exit interviews should be conducted with board members who resign before their term of office expires to ascertain the real motive of the resignation. She thanked the four resigning members for the role they played at the SABC and wished them well moving forward. The resignations are believed to be a result of Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams going “to war” with the SABC board over proposed job cuts.
