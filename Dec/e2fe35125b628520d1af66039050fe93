Microsoft has confirmed that it is rebuilding its Edge desktop browser on the open-source Chromium project. Chromium is the same web rendering engine which powers Google’s Chrome browser, and will replace Microsoft’s EdgeHTML rendering engine which is currently used within the Edge browser. Initial reports of this change surfaced earlier this week, and Microsoft has now confirmed it will change its browser over to Chromium, with the new browser also set to launch on MacOS. “Ultimately, we want to make the web experience better for many different audiences,” Microsoft said. “People using Microsoft Edge (and potentially other browsers) will experience improved compatibility with all websites, while getting the best-possible battery life and hardware integration on all kinds of Windows devices.” The overhauled version of Microsoft Edge will launch as a standalone executable across Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10. Microsoft said it expects to have a preview build of its new Chromium-based browser ready in early 2019.
