Eskom has implemented stage 1 load-shedding for today, which will last from 09:00 to 22:00 it said. Eskom asked users to save power today in an attempt to cut down on their usage. All senior managers at Eskom have been asked to cancel their leave and personally visit power stations to see what the state of affairs is, due to constant load-shedding in recent weeks. Between 15 December and 15 January, though, no load shedding is expected due to businesses shutting down. Power cuts may return in the new year, however.
