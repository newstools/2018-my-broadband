A Vodacom store at Mall of the North in Polokwane has been ransacked, according to posts on Twitter. Crime Stoppers’ Yusuf Abramjee posted a video and images of the attack on Twitter. A separate video was also posted by another Twitter user who was at the mall at the time of the incident. The Twitter user said the store was attacked by EFF members, as they were protesting a statement made by Corruption Watch chairperson Mavuso Msimang at the recent Vodacom Journalist of the Year Awards. Reports have shown that Msimang said Julius Malema and the EFF were abusers of democracy, and showed an image of them during a presentation. This was seen as Vodacom declaring war on the EFF, according to social media posts. Vodacom confirmed that Msimang spoke at the event, and said his views were his own, but that they supported free speech. The videos below show the attack.   Following the videos being posted, Abramjee posted images of “EFF members” gathering at a Vodacom store in East Gate Mall.  Vodacom told MyBroadband it has received a report from the franchise store owner at the Mall of the North about an incident that took place today. “Three women were assaulted and goods stolen from the store. We understand that the business owner is cooperating with authorities,” said Vodacom. “Vodacom respects the right of every South African to freedom of expression and to hold legal and peaceful protests, but condemns any form of violent behavior, including wanton destruction of property associated with such actions.” It added that the incidents are “seemingly linked” to the comments made by Msimang at the awards event.
