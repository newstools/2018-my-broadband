Eskom has announced on Twitter that stage 2 load-shedding has been implemented. According to Eskom, stage 2 load-shedding will take place from 9:00 to 22:00, and will also include stage 2 load curtailment. “We apologise for the inconvenience,” added Eskom. Stage 2 load-shedding was also implemented yesterday, which Eskom blamed on planned and unplanned maintenance. A recent report in the Sunday Times suggested that South Africans should expect load-shedding to continue for years to come.
