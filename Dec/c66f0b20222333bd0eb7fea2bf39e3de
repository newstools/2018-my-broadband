Towards the end of November, Telkom increased the expiry windows of its data bundles. This coincided with the announcement that Telkom had enabled transferring data from any of its plans to other subscribers. Smaller data bundles have a six-month expiry, while bundles over 500MB are valid for two calendar months. Telkom has since confirmed that it also made changes to its FreeMe bundles, and that the extensions only apply to non-promotional data. FreeMe bundles below 500MB have a validity of 14 days, while larger bundles now have two expiry windows – 61 days for the data, and 31 days for all the other features. The other features included in Telkom’s FreeMe bundles are free data for chat services like WhatsApp and Viber, SMS messages, and minutes for calling any other Telkom number. FreeMe Bundles with 2GB of data or more include LIT Music, which offers 5GB of data for streaming audio over Google Play Music, Apple Music, Simfy Africa, and CliffCentral. Bundles that have 5GB or more include 25GB of free data for video streaming over Google Play, iTunes, Netflix, Showmax, and YouTube. These benefits are different for FreeMe contract subscribers, who get 10GB of LIT Music data, and 50GB of LIT Video data. Telkom’s data bundle prices and expiry windows are summarised in the tables below.
