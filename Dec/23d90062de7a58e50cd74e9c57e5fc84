Apple has come under fire for the exorbitant prices it is charging for its latest iPhone Xs and Xr ranges. The latest iPhone Xs Max’s price reaches as much as R32,000 for the 512GB version. This has resulted in disappointing sales numbers for Apple’s latest devices, with suppliers suffering due to weak demand. This poor performance has also resulted in Apple’s brief loss of their title as the world’s most valuable company. The poor performance of the iPhone Xs and Xr has benefited second-hand dealers and iPhone repair stores, however. According to CEO of Cellucity and joint MD of AppleDoctor Sean Joffe, iPhones are particularly popular in the second-hand smartphone market. “The demand for second-hand iPhones is best illustrated by their relatively higher values compared to most Android devices,” said Joffe. He added that second-hand iPhones are difficult to source because so many South African customers hand down their old iPhones within their families, or keep them as spares. According to Joffe, demand is high for devices from the iPhone 7 and up. “The iPhone X holds a very high resale value as they are extremely difficult to buy second-hand due to very limited supply,” he added. He adds that while discounts tend to be between 40% and 50% on a second-hand iPhones, the iPhone X only offers a 30% discount due to how difficult it is to source. According to Joffe, there is a trend to keep phones far longer than before. “The average person now keeps their phone for 31 months, and that number is growing,” he said. He added that AppleDoctor has seen a three-fold increase in demand over the past year in new batteries. “Service and repair is definitely the trend, with consumers not rushing out to buy a new phone,” said Joffe. “This can clearly be seen in the contraction in upgrade numbers in retail, where upgrades are down conservatively by 10%-15%”
