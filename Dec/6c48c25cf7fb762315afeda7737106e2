Buying a Christmas present for a gamer or techie is easier than you think. Step 1, ask them what they want. They will provide a detailed description, a photo of the item, and a link to where you can buy it online. Step 2, buy the item. If you insist on selecting your own gift, at least find out which platform the person games on – PC, PlayStation 4, or Xbox One – and what they enjoy doing. Example, coding, Raspberry Pi builds, and so on. To help you make the best choice possible, we have listed a range of cool PC Christmas gift options.
