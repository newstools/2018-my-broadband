MTN has confirmed to MyBroadband that it met with the EFF yesterday as part of “the company’s ongoing stakeholder engagements with political parties, business organisations and civil society bodies”. Jacqui O’Sullivan, Executive for Corporate Affairs at MTN SA, said it was an insightful session with a strong focus on the economy. The statement comes after Vodacom and its CEO Shameel Joosub met with EFF leaders yesterday, too. The EFF said in a Twitter post that its “leadership met with Black Business Council, MTN Management, and Vodacom Management”. The meetings took place after EFF members vandalized Vodacom outlets in protest of an image of their leaders at the Vodacom Journalist of the Year Awards. “In the meeting, the parties discussed the matter in detail and have resolved the issue. Vodacom acknowledged that it is politically neutral and it doesn’t influence party political positions in any way,” Vodacom said. “Vodacom and EFF appreciate that the matter could have been handled differently to avoid the misunderstanding that occurred.”
