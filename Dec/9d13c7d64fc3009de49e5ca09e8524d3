Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo has confirmed that over 100 million registered Quora users had their personal information accessed by an unauthorised third party. The breach, which Quora discovered on 30 November, accessed account information including email addresses, encrypted passwords, public content such as questions and answers, and private content including direct messages. To combat this breach, Quora logged all users out, and forced all accounts using a password as authentication to reset it. Quora is still investigating the exact cause of the breach, and has acquired the services of digital forensics teams to assist in this process. Anonymous questions and answers were not affected by the breach because Quora doesn’t store the information of anonymous contributors. Quora users that were affected by the breach can expect an email from the website, outlining all of the relevant details.
