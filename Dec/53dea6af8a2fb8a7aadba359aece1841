Nvidia has officially announced its new top-of-the-range GPU for consumers, the Titan RTX. Labeled “the world’s most powerful desktop GPU”, it sports 72 Turing RT and 4,608 CUDA cores – outperforming the RTX 2080 Ti, which offers 68 and 4,352 respectively. It also includes 24GB of GDDR6 VRAM – double that of the RTX 2080 Ti – and is aimed at the hardcore computing needs of researchers as well as wealthy gamers. It offers a TU102 GPU, and can be used in combination with a second Titan RTX if users buy an $80 NVLink Bridge. In terms of gaming, it is likely to be 10%-20% more effective than the RTX 2080 Ti. Nvidia also highlighted the Titan RTX GPU’s ability to edit 8K video in real time. The Titan RTX will cost $2,500, which is over twice the price of the RTX 2080 Ti.
