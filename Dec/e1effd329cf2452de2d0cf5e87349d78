Eskom has started stage 2 load-shedding, due to severe pressure on the power grid. “Due to continued pressure on the national grid, Eskom will implement stage 2 load-shedding from 4pm to 10pm today,” it said. “Apologies for the inconvenience and uncertainty that this is causing. Eskom will continue to provide regular updates on this matter.” Load-shedding has already taken a severe toll on Cell C customers today, following it resulting in a power surge at a Neotel data centre which took down Cell C’s network. The operator said services were down for 2 hours as a result.
