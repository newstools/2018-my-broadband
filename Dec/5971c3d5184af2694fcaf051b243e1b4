Facebook Inc. buildings in the Silicon Valley town of Menlo Park were evacuated after a bomb threat. A bomb threat unit was on the scene, searching a building in the 200 block of Jefferson Drive, the Menlo Park Police Department said in a statement. The headquarters of Facebook-owned Instagram is on that block. A Facebook spokesman said a few buildings were evacuated, but all employees are safe. The company will send further updates once the situation is clearer.
