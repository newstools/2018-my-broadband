Apple has added a $29 (R400), 18-watt USB-C power adapter to the Apple Store that can be used to fast charge your iPad or iPhone. The new charging device serves as an alternative to the more expensive 30-watt USB-C charger that is usually shipped with MacBooks. Apple recommends the charger is paired with either the 11-inch iPad Pro or the 12.9-inch 3rd generation iPad Pro, for optimal performance. However, if you want to use the new power adapter to fast charge your iPhone, you will need to purchase Appleâ€™s official USB-C to Lightning cable for another $19 (R250). iPhones have supported fast charging since the iPhone 8 range, but do not come packaged with a fast charger. This new charger will allow owners of these phones to join the owners of most high-end Android phones in having access to this functionality.
