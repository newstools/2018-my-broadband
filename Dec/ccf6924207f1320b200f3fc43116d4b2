HackerRank has released its 2018 student developer report, which outlines what students look for in job opportunities. The research is based on questions posed to 10,351 student developers. According to the report, the most important criteria student developers are looking for is the potential for professional growth and learning – which 58% of respondents deemed to be important . Second on the list was a good work/life balance, which 52% of respondents said was important. Having interesting problems to solve came in at third place with 46%. These were significantly more important to student developers than compensation and perks, which came in at 18% and 11% respectively. The study also found that 65% of students rely at least partially on self-learning to improve their coding skills, while only 32% learned to code entirely in their classes. The survey said that students most commonly used Stack Overflow and YouTube to learn new programming languages. “Today’s average CS curriculum is not a clear indicator that a student will possess the skills needed to enter the workforce,” added HackerRank.
