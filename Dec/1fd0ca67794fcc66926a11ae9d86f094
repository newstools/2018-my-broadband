MTN has implemented new data usage notifications, marking the first step in its shift towards compliance with ICASA’s End-Users and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations. The mobile operator said that from 14 December 2018, all customers would begin receiving notifications when they have depleted 50%, 80%, and 100% of their monthly data balance or inclusive data. These notifications allow users to better track their data usage and spend, allowing them to recharge when they need to and prevent out-of-bundle data usage. This change applies to both prepaid and postpaid customers. “Over the past weeks we have worked around the clock to do extensive system changes to comply with the requirements of the new regulations,” said MTN South Africa executive for corporate affairs Jacqui O’Sullivan. “We are pleased that we have successfully taken a step towards complying with the new regulations, which will go a long way towards improving customer experience and helping customers to manage their data spend,” O’Sullivan added. All South African mobile networks have until 28 February 2019 to comply with the new regulations. Under ICASA’s new regulations, all Internet service providers – including mobile networks – are prohibited from charging subscribers for out-of-bundle usage without consent. They also require networks to offer the ability to roll over unused data, and allow for the transfer of data to another subscriber on the same network. These regulations also require that operators allow customers to transfer data to other subscribers on the same network.
