Liquid Telecom South Africa announced that it will establish a multi-billion rand 4G network in South Africa. From early 2019, wholesale roaming services will be made available across Liquid Telecom’s network nationwide. “This development will enable us to provide Mobile Network Operators and ISPs with open access to our mobile 4G network,” Liquid Telecom South Africa CEO Reshaad Sha said. “Using our 1,800MHz spectrum, the network will handle 4G mobile data traffic to meet the needs of the most demanding users across the country.” Liquid Telecom has been investing heavily across the continent where it operates Africa’s largest independent fibre network. Its African network is almost 70,000km in length and linked to more than 600 towns and cities in 13 countries. This includes the recent completion of Liquid Telecom’s ‘Cape to Cairo’ network which represents the first direct land-based terrestrial fibre link from Cape Town to Cairo.
