Netflix has revealed its ISP Speed Index for November 2018, with Cool Ideas retaining the top spot. South Africa’s ISPs achieved an average speed of 2.53Mbps during the month, a slight increase over last month’s average. The country’s overall rank on the charts also increased to 52 out of 59, up from 53 last month. However, South Africa’s rank still remains lower than its previous best of 50th place, which it last achieved in August. The index is a measure of prime-time Netflix performance on particular ISPs, and not a measure of overall performance on the networks. Netflix said it calculates the average bitrate of Netflix content, in Mbps, streamed by its members per ISP. “We measure the speed via all available end-user devices. For a small number of devices, we cannot calculate the exact bit rates, and streaming via cellular networks is exempted from our measurements,” said Netflix. Netflix recommends a 5Mbps connection for full HD streaming, which may explain why the average speeds are all below the 5Mbps mark. The fastest 10 ISPs for prime-time Netflix streaming in South Africa are listed below.
