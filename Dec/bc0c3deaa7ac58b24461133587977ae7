MTN has launched a “world first” music streaming service called MusicTime. The service is an offering from the team at Simfy Africa, said MTN. It is a “fully inclusive time-based music streaming service” which offers users premium trending and locally relevant music through partnerships with music labels and providers. “The MusicTime offering is set to revolutionise Africa’s music industry with a fully inclusive music streaming offering that includes a countdown timer, top trending music, and data included in the price,” said MTN. MTN said the service works based on a timer clock that counts down as users listen to music. MusicTime is available as either: Both packages are valid for 7 days from purchase. “Prepaid customers can purchase music time using airtime at affordable price points. All new users receive 60 minutes free upon their MusicTime app download, valid for seven days.” MTN said the MusicTime catalogue boasts “millions of tracks” and that it works on Android and iOS. “With the app being completely transparent and requiring no subscription, users can listen to the music they want, when they want, with no hidden data costs, advertisements, or other interruptions.” Jacqui O’Sullivan, Executive for Corporate Affairs at MTN SA, said MusicTime will let their customers be among the first to listen to premium local and international tracks from the latest albums as they launch globally for only R5, with data included.
