Althon Beukes has been appointed as chief information officer for the Telkom Group. According to an email sent to Telkom staff by CEO Sipho Maseko, Beukes will assume the role of group CIO with immediate effect. The position of CIO has been vacant since May this year, following Len de Villiers’ retirement. Beukes most recently held the post of chief commercial officer at Openserve, and previously served as BCX chief of international business, BCX chief operations officer, and Cybernest managing director. In his new position, Beukes will focus on Telkom’s IT and digital strategy, governance and enterprise architecture, and business procurement. Maseko said that Smangele Nkosi will serve as Openserve chief commercial officer following Beuke’s appointment to group CIO. MyBroadband reached out to Telkom, who confirmed that Beukes has been appointed to the CIO position. “Althon has worked for the Telkom Group in various capacities since 1994 and I am confident that he will go from strength to strength in his new role,” said Maseko.
