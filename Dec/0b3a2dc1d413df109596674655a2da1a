Capitec can’t accommodate Home Affairs service desks for Smart ID and passports in its branches, a spokesperson for the bank has told MyBroadband. “Capitec strives to give our customers the most affordable banking solution – that means smaller optimised branches allow us to keep fees as low as possible,” the bank stated. “For this reason our branches cannot accommodate the addition of smart offices.” This follows the launch of the eHomeAffairs programme in South Africa, which lets you apply for smart IDs and passports online and then visit a bank branch to have your biometric data captured. Once the smart ID or passport is ready, you collect it through the same bank branch. Last month, the Department of Home Affairs revealed that another 20 bank branches will be added to the 13 that are already part of the Smart ID programme. BusinessTech reported that banks will add Home Affairs services to branches in Durban, Pietermaritzburg, East London, Nelspruit, and Polokwane. Home Affairs has not responded to questions regarding which banks will be included, but Absa did reveal to BusinessTech where it would roll out ID services. Currently there is only one branch in the programme located outside of Gauteng – Standard Bank in Canal Walk. The table below summarises which bank branches currently participate in the eHomeAffairs programme.
