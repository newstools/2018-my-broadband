South African Airways, working alongside Nedbank, has launched the SAA Voyager Cheque card. This card allows users to earn SAA Voyager Miles when they swipe. “The launch of the new SAA Voyager Cheque Card allows even more people access to this globally recognised frequent flyer programme,” said Nedbank executive Chris Wood. Voyager Miles can be used for a wide variety of travel expenses, including flights, accommodation costs, car hire, duty-free shopping, and cruises. “SAA Voyager Premium cardholders enjoy an enhanced travel experience thanks to preferential check-in and lounge access when flying on SAA-operated flights or SAA marketing flights where Mango is the carrier,” said executive for customer loyalty at SAA, Suretha Cruse. Beyond earning miles based on their spending, customers can earn other bonuses, including 2,500 miles for signing up, double miles for the first month, and bonus miles upon reaching spending thresholds. Applications are available online or at any Nedbank branch, and the SAA Voyager Cheque Card can be added to selected Nedbank transactional accounts.
