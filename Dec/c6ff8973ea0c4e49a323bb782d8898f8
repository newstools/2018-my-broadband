Afrihost has told MyBroadband that 2018 was a good year for the popular ISP, and it is pleased with the growth it has seen. This is particularly true in the fixed-wireless space, said the company. Afrihost offered a range of packages in this category, including fixed-LTE services which run on the Rain network and the Cell C network. Rain stopped offering fixed-LTE packages towards the end of 2018, but the products which run on Cell C’s network are still available. “We’ve also invested heavily in our client service. Afrihost was the first ISP to launch WhatsApp support – which we’re constantly improving,” said Afrihost. “We’ve also seen an improvement in response times on all platforms – which we’re extremely pleased with.” Afrihost currently offers support via WhatsApp, Live Chat, email, ClientZone, and a call centre. Going into 2019, Afrihost said its focus will start with its clients. “We’d like to make even more improvements in our client service and ensure that we’re maximising our resources to our client’s benefit,” it said. Afrihost added that it also wants to bolster its existing product range to see where it can “add additional value to our clients”. Afrihost’s current range of products include fibre, DSL, fixed-wireless, mobile, hosting and domain services.
