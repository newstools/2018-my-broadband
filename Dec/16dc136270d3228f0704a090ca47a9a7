Twitter user @HackerGiraffeÂ has hacked 50,000 printers, causing them to print a message asking users to subscribe to PewDiePie. Popular gaming YouTuber PewDiePie has had the most subscribers on the platform for years, but was recently overtaken by Indian record label T-Series. As a result, his fans have been driving various campaigns to attract new subscribers to his channel. According to HackerGiraffe, he manipulated vulnerable printer protocols to keep users informed about the vulnerabilities of these printers. The PewDiePie message, said the hacker, was not the purpose of the hack, but rather the result of needing something to print. Similar printer hacks have been executed in the past, including one by hacker Weev, who hacked thousands of printers to print anti-Semitic messages.
