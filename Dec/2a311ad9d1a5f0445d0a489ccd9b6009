A new class action lawsuit has been filed against Apple for allegedly selling certain iMac and MacBook models without dust filters, reports 9To5Mac. Law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro claims that the lack of appropriate dust filters means that dust gets inside the devices, affecting the screen as well as performance. “The computer intakes air to cool its components, but with no filter, dust gets trapped inside,” says the lawsuit. The lawsuit also alleges that Apple is unwilling to fix the problem, and is instead making customers pay hundreds of dollars to fix the issues caused by this flaw. “We believe Apple owes it to the purchasers of these premium, high-end computers to pay for the widespread defect,” it said. This isn’t the first time the law firm has taken on Apple. Previously, they won a $450-million lawsuit against alleged price fixing in the iBooks store.
