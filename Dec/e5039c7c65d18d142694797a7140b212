Many Telkom Mobile customers have reported experiencing network problems this evening, with no data throughput and slow connection speeds. Telkom fixed-LTE services are also reportedly affected. Customers took to Twitter, the MyBroadband Forum, and Down Detector to post complaints about problems with their mobile data connections. The problems appear to be country wide, and started between 18:00 and 19:00. MyBroadband has also received emails from Telkom customers about their mobile services being down. Telkom was asked for comment on what was causing the problem, but it did not immediately reply to questions. The company did state on Twitter, however, that there has been “network downtime” this evening. It must be noted that Openserve fibre has not been reported as affected by the downtime. The tweet is shown below.  The graph below shows the big increase in complaints about Telkom from around 19:00 on Friday, 7 December.
