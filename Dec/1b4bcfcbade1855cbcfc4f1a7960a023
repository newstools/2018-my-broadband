Tesla’s Powerwall batteries are completely sold out in South Africa and suppliers that manage to secure stock are selling them as fast as they can land units in the country. This is according to Greg Blandford who is the sales director at Rubicon, an authorised Tesla Energy distributor in South Africa. Blandford said that they recently received six of the original Tesla Powerwall units and they were all sold to installers on the same day. No more Powerwall units are expected to be allocated to South Africa until 2020. “If we get lucky,” Blandford told MyBroadband. Demand for backup power solutions in South Africa has spiked in recent weeks as load-shedding hits the country. Citizens who can afford backup power solutions, like the Powerwall, can mitigate the effects of load-shedding and keep essential devices like lights, PCs, TVs, and routers running despite their Eskom power being out. Tesla unveiled the Powerwall 2 in October 2016, just over a year after CEO Elon Musk introduced the original Powerwall at a product launch. The Powerwall 2 started selling in South Africa during 2017, but demand soon outstripped supply. When Tesla first launched the Powerwall 2, it was priced at $5,500 per battery, excluding installation, with an additional $700 for supporting hardware known as the Gateway. Tesla has hiked the price of the Powerwall 2 twice this year – first to $5,900 and most recently to $6,700. It has also increased the price of the Gateway from $700 to $1,000, Greentech Media reported. “We occasionally adjust our global pricing to best reflect what we’re offering to customers and the value of our products. The price adjustments made today are the latest example of that,” Tesla said in a statement.
