Intel has confirmed that development of its upcoming discrete graphics cards is on track and that it will launch its GPU products in 2020. Speaking in an interview with HotHardware, Intel Visual Technologies Team general manager Ari Rauch said that Intel’s first discrete graphics products will be available in 2020, adding that the company will launch GPUs for both consumer and server applications. Rauch did not state whether Intel would work with OEM partners to sell its GPUs or sell the products directly. “Intel works with an incredibly large and diverse channel ecosystem and our decisions will be centered around bringing great products and solutions to market quickly that focus on the overall experience in unique form factors,” he said. Despite the company struggling to move from 14nm to 10nm architecture across its CPU lineup, Rauch said Intel is confident about its product roadmap for the next few years. Intel remained tight-lipped regarding the performance or pricing of its upcoming discrete GPUs, but the company did say it would consider input from the community as it continues to develop its products.
