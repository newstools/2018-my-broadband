A “reliable source” has told the DA that arrests have been made after the vandalism that took place at Vodacom’s Mall of North store in Polokwane. The DA’s Limpopo Premier Candidate Jacques Smalle said that more arrests are likely in the coming days. The attack was allegedly carried out over an image of Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu which was captioned “abusers of democracy,” used by Corruption Watch chairperson Mavuso Msimang at Vodacom’s 2018 Journalist of the Year Awards. “These arrests are welcomed and are a beginning to quell the inherent thuggery and bullying dished out by the EFF whenever someone expresses a view divergent to theirs,” said Smalle. “We also thank the South African Police Service (SAPS) for their professional conduct in this matter and also hope for the process to conclude without fear or favour,” he added. MyBroadband was previously told by Vodacom that three women were assaulted, and goods were stolen as part of the vandalism.
