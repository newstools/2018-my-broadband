Vodacom has re-launched its Vodacom World mall in Midrand, Gauteng, with it offering a new look and layout. The mall was shut down for renovations on 17 March, and has only just opened following extensive changes. Unlike the previous Vodacom World, the redesigned building forgoes the standard tenant model and instead partnered with multiple companies to deliver extensive product displays, consumer technologies, and demos. Vodacom World mall now includes dedicated experience rooms which allow customers to experience mobile-enabled technologies offering IoT products, gaming demos, coding workshops, and more. The venue also offers visitors the ability to rent connection labs and workspaces which offer high-speed connectivity and digitally-enabled environments. A coffee shop is also situated within the venue, catering to both visitors and employees. Speaking at the official opening of the venue, Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub said the location was the biggest digital telecommunications mall in the world, boasting 6,000m2 of shopping floor space. Joosub added that the mall would cater for all age groups, and will offer coding lessons for children in addition to dedicated areas for gaming, virtual reality experiences, and product showcases. Vodacom World will officially open to the public on 7 December 2018. MyBroadband attend the opening event, and photos of the redesigned mall are posted below.
