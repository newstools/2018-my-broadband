Multiple MyBroadband users have reported that Netflix is working on their Telkom LIT TV boxes. The media player from Telkom was set to support Netflix when it launched in 2017, but users quickly found the streaming service was not available. Telkom stated in February 2018 that this was due to Netflix approval for the LIT box taking longer than initially expected. “When we were preparing to launch LIT, Netflix wanted to certify the LIT box and explained that it’s a standard procedure that should be completed before we go live,” said Telkom at the time. Before Telkom was set to launch LIT, however, Netflix said it had a backlog of devices that needed testing. In October 2018, Telkom said it was upgrading its LIT media player to Android 8.0 – finally making it Netflix compliant. Following the announcement that Telkom was upgrading the LIT box to Android 8.0, Telkom unveiled a “new partnership” with Netflix in South Africa in November. The company stated that as a result, Netflix will be available on the LIT box “later this year”. Telkom further stated that Telkom and Netflix are working on “exciting mobile and broadband service offerings”. These will be launched before the end of 2018, and will include enhanced LIT video options and data offerings, said Telkom. Following these announcements, MyBroadband forum members who own Telkom LIT boxes have stated that firmware updates were rolled out and Netflix was now working on the devices. Users with “older” version of the LIT box reported issues with streaming Netflix, however. The model numbers referenced by affected users were the “B05” box. Telkom was asked for comment on the rollout of Netflix to the Telkom LIT platform, but the company did not reply to questions.
