As businesses continue to move towards the cloud, it’s imperative that your business isn’t left behind. Office 365 by Microsoft is undoubtedly the pinnacle of all the office suites available to businesses today. It allows you to access desktop versions of all the popular office applications – including Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Access. Not only can you use all these state-of-the-art programs, but you can also access your documents and data from anywhere in the world. Additionally, however, users will get access to web versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint – while premium subscribers also get access to a web version of Outlook. Microsoft’s new Office 365 Business Premium product offers a range of incredibly useful extra features that are not available with the standard 365 Business product. Premium subscribers can run video conference calls with up to 250 people, allowing businesses to hold long-distance meetings efficiently. The Premium version of Office 365 Business also allows businesses to implement a company-wide intranet system, as well as team sites, through SharePoint. Other tools included in the Office 365 Business Premium include Microsoft Teams – which creates a hub for teamwork – Outlook Customer Manager, Microsoft Bookings, and Microsoft Planner. Office 365 Business subscribers will also get access to OneDrive, through which these businesses can manage and store all data by utilising the power of the cloud.
