Cell C has confirmed on Twitter that it is experiencing a network outage due to Eskom load-shedding. Many Cell C users took to Twitter and Down Detector to report network downtime, with users in Gauteng, Cape Town, George, and Mpumalanga complaining of having zero service. Users on Cell C-backed MVNOs – such as FNB Connect – also reported that they were not receiving any service. Tests by MyBroadband with a smartphone using a Cell C SIM revealed that there was no service in the Centurion area. The image below shows one of many tweets from Cell C support on Twitter explaining the downtime.  Fixed-LTE customers who have ISP packages that run on Cell C’s network have also been told that there is a “national outage” on their services. Cell C’s network team were said to be working to restore normal service as quickly as possible. Cell C told MyBroadband it is aware of a problem at one of its data centres that is affecting the voice and data services of customers. “Technicians are working on a resolution to the problem. We apologise for the inconvenience caused and will continue to provide updates on the situation.” Users were quick to complain on Twitter about the downtime. Users reported that despite being in areas which were not affected by load-shedding, the network was down for them.  Down Detector saw a massive spike in Cell C downtime reports from after 10:00 this morning.
