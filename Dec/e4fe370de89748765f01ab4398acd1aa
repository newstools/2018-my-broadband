Businesses, schools, and other locations around the world have begun receiving waves of bomb threats, causing numerous evacuations. According to authorities from multiple countries, there is no evidence of any bombs actually being planted – but the threats have prompted numerous investigations by police departments around the world. The bomb threats appear in the form of an email sent by an anonymous address with the subject line “Do not waste your time”. The email warns the reader that a person has hidden an explosive device in the building where the recipient’s business is conducted and threatens to detonate the bomb if the recipient does not transfer $20,000 in Bitcoin to the scammer’s address. “If the explosive device detonates and the authorities see this letter: We are not terrorists and don’t assume any liability for explosions in other places,” the email reads. These emails have reportedly been sent to businesses in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with most authorities stating that these threats are not considered credible.
