MTN was recently awarded the title of joint best network at the 2018 MyBroadband Conference, as the network continues to strive towards creating the best network possible for its subscribers. MTN General Manager of enterprise marketing, Llewellyn Ramsagar, said that the award serves as proof that MTN’s network investments are paying dividends not only for consumers, but also for enterprise clients. Ramsagar added that it is only through having a reliable, high-speed network that MTN business’ enterprise division can deliver to its clients.  MTN has spent around R40 billion on infrastructure over the past few years, helping the network continue to keep its position atop the African mobile network industry. MTN Business has also been assisting app developers, small businesses, and even medium enterprises with sizeable investments, as MTN hopes to keep on the cutting edge of innovation. This will ensure that MTN will be able to better identify the “killer applications of the future.” “We’re in the middle of the 4th industrial revolution,” said Ramsagar, “and speed really is the new currency.” Through high-speed data and connectivity, he added, MTN is enabling the world of next-generation technology to become closer to reality.
