Samsung Pay was launched in South Africa on 21 August 2018, offering users a secure and easy-to-use platform to make contactless mobile payments. Samsung Pay provides consumers with a new, secure way to pay almost anywhere you can swipe or tap a card – covering millions of merchant locations. This is achieved by combining NFC (near field communication) with Samsung’s proprietary MST (magnetic secure transmission) technologies. Samsung Pay is compatible with select cards and Samsung devices, and leading providers. MyBroadband has partnered with Samsung to give you a chance to win great prizes, including a Samsung multiroom speaker and a Samsung 11,300mAh battery bank. This giveaway will end on Wednesday, 19 December 2018.
