South Africans attempting to renew their driver’s licences are encountering a host of problems, with the Department of Transport unable to deliver new cards. A number of drivers have expressed frustration surrounding the process behind their licence renewal, with delays reportedly lasting months. The Centurion Rekord recently reported that many motorists are waiting for their licences, and were being told to apply for temporary cards. These problems started in August 2018, when employees on strike at the Driving Licence Card Account (DLCA) caused a delay in the printing of new cards. “We had a strike that went on but equally at that time we had an upgrade of the production system, and we had taken about three weeks to do that,” DLCA CEO Collins Letsoalo said in an interview. “As a result, we had a backlog of a number of cards.” Radio 702 has also reported that many users were encountering delays with their driver’s licence renewals through to October 2018. More recently, The Mercury reported that drivers in KwaZulu-Natal were worried about driving illegally due to constant delays in the driver’s licence renewal process. As of December 2018, the temporary driver’s licences delivered to those waiting for new cards have since expired – leaving drivers without a legal way to drive their vehicles. As of 8 December 2018, the Department of Transport has told users still waiting for their new driver’s licence cards to apply for temporary cards. These cards are valid for six months and will ensure that drivers comply with regulations while the delays at the DLCA are resolved. “An outstanding 90,000 driver’s licences will be printed within the next three weeks,” a spokesperson told the Centurion Rekord. “We are pleased that affected employees have since agreed to resume their duties. Since then, over 800,000 cards were printed with over 500,000 cards dispatched.”
