According to analyst Anne Lee, next year’s iPhones will remain similar to the current iPhone Xs and Xr ranges, reports Softpedia. “We think the three new iPhones in 2019 will likely have the same form factors as the 2018 iPhone Xr, Xs, and Xs Max, with some added AR-related features,” said Lee. According to Lee, this is due to Apple’s planned 2020 release of 5G devices, which will signal more significant changes to Apple’s smartphones. Apple’s 2018 iPhone sales figures have been underwhelming, which makes Lee’s prediction particularly surprising. Lee predicts that Apple iPhone sales could decrease even more next year, estimating the figure to be around 204 million units. Reports have indicated that while Apple only plans to release its first 5G mobile devices in 2020, a variety of Android 5G devices will release in 2019.
