Lotus will release a new, £2-million (R36-million) electric car that will pack 1,000HP, according to leaks from Autocar. The new vehicle would be the fastest and most expensive Lotus vehicle ever. This new, aggressive move towards creating more expensive vehicles comes as the new owner of Lotus – Geely – seeks to make Lotus the flagship brand of the company, using it to show off Geely’s technologies and capabilities. The new vehicle would look to compete with other powerful electric vehicles. When asked for comment, Lotus said: “Lotus’s development team is exploring numerous engineering projects, across multiple vehicle sectors, using several propulsion systems. As part of the development process, these projects undergo continual and stringent valuation and only the best will reach production.”
