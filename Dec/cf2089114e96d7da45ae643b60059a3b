The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has successfully passed a vote to classify SMSs as Title 1 information under the USA’s Telecom Act, which will allow phone companies to block spam SMSs, reports Cnet. “We shouldn’t allow unwanted messages to plague wireless messaging services in the same way that unwanted robocalls flood voice services,” said FCC chairman Ajit Pai. He added that classifying SMSs as Title 1, as opposed to Title 2, will help ensure that this doesn’t happen. The only opposing voice on the FCC, democrat Jessica Rosenworcel, said the FCC is misleading people about the real point of the new classification. “Today’s decision offers consumers no new ability to prevent robotexts,” she said.”It simply provides that carriers can block our text messages and censor the very content of those messages themselves.” The FCC has also voted to build a database of phone numbers, allowing those who don’t want to receive “robocalls” to remove themselves from the list.
