Makro recently said it is working hard to deliver all its Black Friday orders after its Black 5 Day Sale 2018 exceeded expectations. The retailer informed customers that orders during its Black 5 Day Sale would be delivered within 7-to-10 working days. Makro said it has already fulfilled 87% of online purchases within 7-to-10 working days and is working around the clock to fulfil the remaining orders. For those waiting to have their orders delivered, there is unfortunately a problem of miscommunication from the company. MyBroadband tested the delivery of many major retailers over Black Friday, and Makro is one of the companies which has not completed its orders yet. MyBroadband received an SMS on 6 December to collect a television it ordered from a local Makro store. The SMS states: Your order MAK******* is ready for collection at Centurion. Please bring your order confirmation and ID in store within 7 days. 0860 600 999. This message was surprising, as we had paid for delivery for the television. However, we accepted that there may be delivery problems and went to the store. When we arrived at Makro we were directed to the online shopping area, where we were told that our order was unfortunately cancelled. When we queried the cancellation, we were referred to a manager who seemed to know exactly what had happened, but had an entirely different explanation. She said they were tasked with validating TV licences at the local Makro branch, and that the SMS and the cancellation of the order were both incorrect and should be ignored. Despite the fact that the order showed “cancelled” on the Makro system, the manager said it would be delivered from their main warehouse. There was no indication of when the item will be delivered. What is clear, however, is that the SMS message was a mistake and that you will waste your time if you try to collect your order set for delivery at your local Makro branch.
