Black Friday 2018 was the biggest online shopping period ever in South Africa, with strong growth in ecommerce sales when compared to the same period last year. This big spike in online sales put tremendous pressure on ecommerce shops and courier companies to get products to clients. Apart from the challenge to pick and pack products in warehouses, overloaded courier companies can result in delivery delays. A test by MyBroadband showed that only 50% of Black Friday products were delivered within a week. Parcelninja, which helps South African online shops with their fulfilment needs, was one of the standout performers on Black Friday. Parcelninja processed around 20,000 products through 7,000 orders over the Black Friday weekend without any problems or delays. Parcelninja CEO Justin Drennan explained that they were able to do around 80% of deliveries the day after the product was purchased. This, he said, was made possible by their investment in advanced IT systems which allocate deliveries across multiple couriers – based on load and delivery volume commitments from couriers. Parcelninja has one of the biggest outsourced warehouse and distribution operations in South Africa, which makes it a popular choice for local ecommerce companies. Parcelninja therefore does the heavy lifting for online shops, which allows them to focus on sales and marketing to grow their businesses.
