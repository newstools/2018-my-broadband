Mobile networks are often on the receiving end of angry customers who feel they are not treated fairly. Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, and Telkom have come under fire for a range of reported problems, from “disappearing data” to being signed up for WASPs without their permission. Other complaints which are often posted online include poor customer service, not having complaints resolved, and in Telkom’s case customers not being able to cancel contracts. To see how mobile networks are fairing in terms of customer reviews, we looked at the latest ratings on Hellopeter. Hellopeter describes itself as South Africa’s top reviews company, and lets users read reviews online from customers who have rated a company’s services – from 1 to 5 stars. Hellopeter also provides functionality for users to provide specific complaints and list their problems, or provide positive feedback about a good experience. Companies can then choose to have a profile on Hellopeter and provide feedback to users. The table below lists the “star” ratings of Cell C, MTN, Vodacom, and Telkom on Hellopeter at the time of writing. It also lists the companies’ “TrustIndex” score out of 10. The Hellopeter TrustIndex is a way for customers to “determine how credible a business is”. It is calculated by looking at a company’s average review star ratings, time to reply, the Bayesian average, and review depreciation over time, said Hellopeter. It must be noted that Rain Mobile was excluded as it only had 9 reviews. The images below are screenshots of comments posted on the mobile networks’ profiles on Hellopeter.
