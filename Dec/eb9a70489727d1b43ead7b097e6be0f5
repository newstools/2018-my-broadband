TorrentFreak has released its list of the 10 most pirated TV shows of 2018. Topping the list is The Walking Dead, which TorrentFreak said has been downloaded “millions of times.” The highest new entry on the list is Titans, which features at fifth place after releasing its debut season in October 2018. Other new entries on the list include Westworld and DC’s Legends of Tomorrow. Game of Thrones, which topped the list for the past six years, is not present on the list due to not releasing any new episodes this year. However, the series is still so popular that if the list included torrenting of episodes released before 2018, Game of Thrones would be in first place. View the full list below.
