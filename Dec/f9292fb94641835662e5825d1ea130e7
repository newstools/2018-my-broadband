South African ICT distributor Pinnacle has reminded users that Windows Server 2008 support will end in January 2020. Pinnacle spokesperson, Michelle Losco, said it is therefore urgent to upgrade from the 2008 version now. “Windows Server 2008 was limited to 64 logical processors, which by today’s standards leaves it in the slow lane for modern business operations,” she explained. “Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019’s enhanced security protects on various layers, and in so doing disrupts attacks and isolates vulnerable targets.” She added that the latest Windows servers also have different hardware requirements to 2008. “Most legacy servers are unsuitable and un-optimised for newer Windows Server versions (2016 and 2019),” said Losco. “To take full advantage of modern security, performance and efficiency features, running Windows Server 2016 and 2019 on modern servers is recommended,” Support will continue until at least 2023 for both Windows Server 2016 and 2019. Windows Server 2019 will become available towards the end of December 2018, she added.
