Netflix announced in October that its was launching Netflix gift cards in South Africa. The cards provide a way of paying for the streaming service besides credit card, and were said to be available with denominations from R150 to R1,000. The card were also said not to expire. Existing Netflix members can use the gift cards to top up their Netflix account credit, while those who don’t have an account can redeem the cards on Netflix’s website. Netflix stated that the gift cards were available from a range of local retailers, including CNA, Makro, Checkers, and Game. Several users have reported to MyBroadband that the gift cards are not available in South Africa, however, and when they contacted the retailers they had no record Netflix gift cards coming in. MyBroadband visited the online stores of several of the retailers which were listed as having the cards from Netflix, but could not find the item. Makro, CNA, and Game did not have the Netflix gift cards listed in their inventory, while Checkers also did not have a listing for the cards. The absence of the cards in South Africa was further confirmed when we visited Netflix’s help section on their website. A message on the Netflix website stated that “Netflix Gift Cards are not currently sold in your country” when South Africa was selected. MyBroadband contacted Netflix about the lack of gift cards almost a month after their launch, but the company did not provide feedback on why they were not available. “We are happy that we have launched Netflix Gift Cards in South Africa. We are continuously working on making them available at all designated sales points,” said Netflix.
