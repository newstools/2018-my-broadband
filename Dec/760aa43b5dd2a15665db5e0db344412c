Internet Solutions has offered a preview of its new Parklands data centre in Rosebank, Johannesburg. The Parklands data centre is a R500-million investment by the company, which owns and operates a network of 17 data centres across South Africa. The new data centre is set to officially begin operating in January 2019 and boasts 1,600 square metres of floor space along with 572 racks and 2.2MW of power. IS Data Centres executive head Matthew Ashe said the Parklands data centre will be a world-class facility designed to be ideal for low-latency application environments. “People and businesses are producing and consuming vast quantities of data and the security of that information has never been more important,” Ashe said. “The Parklands Data Centre allows data to be collected, stored and processed locally from a purpose-built modern facility that will help run our services faster and more efficiently.” Energy efficiency is a central consideration for the design of the data centre, Ashe said. “IS remains committed to reducing energy consumption across our data centres, and we won’t stop looking at new ways to advance,” said Ashe. “The benefits are threefold – we keep our costs down, we dramatically reduce our impact on our environment, and ultimately pass the savings on to our customers,” he said.
