Netflix has announced that it will look to acquire original series from Africa in 2019, Variety reports. Netflix vice president Erik Barmack told attendees of the Content London conference that the streaming giant is “looking at opportunities in Africa.” The streaming service has already moved into the European, Asian, and Latin American production markets. “There’s going to come a time when half of the top 10 of most-watched shows in a given year are going to come from outside of the US,” added Barmack. ICASA recently stated that Netflix is not obligated to abide by any local content quotas or requirements in SA. “Netflix is a streaming service and not a licensee,” ICASA told MyBroadband, adding that this rendered them exempt from local content expectations.
