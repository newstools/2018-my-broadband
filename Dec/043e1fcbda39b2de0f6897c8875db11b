Afrihost has launched its “Summer of ’18” promotion with a range of prizes on offer. The competition is celebrating Afrihost’s 18 years of operation in South Africa. There are three set of prizes up for grabs as part of the promotion, with the main prize four Weber braai sets. To enter to win a Weber braai worth R6,000, customers must sign up for any paid Afrihost month-to-month product before the end of December 2018. Afrihost is also giving away mystery gifts throughout December, and users will be randomly selected to enter the mystery prize draw.
