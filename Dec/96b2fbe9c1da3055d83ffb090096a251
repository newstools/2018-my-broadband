Eskom is planning to retrench at least 10 senior executives in an effort to cut costs, according to a report in The Sunday Times. The power utility said a number of senior managers who report directly to Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe could be laid off in the near future. “We are indeed looking at a ballpark figure of about 10 executives but these retrenchments have not yet been finalised,” the company said. Eskom is reportedly looking at cutting down on senior management after previously acknowledging that it had too many executives. “The unions have said there are far too many managers at Eskom and if there are to be retrenchments, it should start there,” the power utility said. “We are now dealing with that part of the management structure.” Eskom is facing a financial crisis as it continues to rack up debt in its efforts to provide enough power for the national grid. The company plans to implement its turnaround strategy in 2019, but will be forced to continue load-shedding into next year due to massive coal shortages.
