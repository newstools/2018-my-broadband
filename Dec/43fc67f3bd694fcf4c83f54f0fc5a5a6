GfK South Africa’s data indicates that panel TV sales increased by 66% to over 93,000 units on Black Friday 2018 compared to the year before. Additionally, retailers sold 29,000 panel TVs in the week after Black Friday – evidence that Black Friday deals are extending in duration. “Hype about panel television sales has definitely shifted from December to November as consumers look out for the best Black Friday deal,” said Kali Moahloli, GfK South Africa. Moahloli added that 151% more panel TVs were sold on Black Friday 2018 than on Black Friday 2016. In contrast, Black Friday smartphone sales only grew by around 4% compared to last year. The rise in smartphone sales between Black Friday 2016 and 2017 was 63%, making the relative lack of growth in 2018 surprising. “Slower smartphone sales growth can be attributed to consumers taking strain from a weak economy and from the gradual saturation of the market,” says Moahloli. Moahloli added that December is traditionally a stronger month for smartphone sales than November.
