Former president Jacob Zuma has joined Twitter in his personal capacity, putting up his first posts this morning. Zuma said he wanted to move with the times and join the platform, which was an important place for discussions to take place. “Thank you for the warm welcome, I look forward to engaging with you,” said Zuma in his first tweet. His second tweet referenced a “false” fundraising campaign in his name, which contained details of a Capitec bank account. The video below details Zuma’s reasons for joining Twitter.
