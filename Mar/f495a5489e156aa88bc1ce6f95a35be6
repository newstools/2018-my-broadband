The Yellow Pages are “moving into a new era”, and will go digital to optimise search efficiency. As of April 2018, the Yellow Pages will have a new look and feel, including a new logo, new brand positioning, and a new strategy to “increase its footprint with younger and digitally-savvy audience”. “This includes existing clients, with offerings of bundled digital products and potential customers with offerings of self-registration and the greater opportunity to be found,” according to a statement from Trudon. “As part of this, the Yellow Pages is also relaunching its app, which will eventually see over 100,000 small and medium businesses registered.” The app also features a chat function which allows consumers to chat to potential suppliers in real time. The app also allows a consumer to see average costs as well as ratings and reviews of previous work done.
