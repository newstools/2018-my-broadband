The ANC has resolved that the SABC needs rebranding and a turnaround strategy. This is according to the ANC’s 54th National Conference report. “The SABC should primarily focus on cultural identity and development as a repository of our heritage and identity,” said the ANC. It added that the migration from analogue to digital broadcasting will allow the SABC to introduce multichannel programming. Multichannel programming will allow the SABC to host a TV channel which will broadcast parliamentary news and other local content. “The channel should be interactive to enable public participation in the unfolding discourse on various topical issues,” said the ANC. Community TV channels could also be on the SABC’s platform, and channels serving communities in all local languages. “Language used in the public media, especially the SABC, should be accessible.” The ANC said South Africa’s migration to digital broadcasting remains a priority and should be completed by June 2019. “The success of this initiative will depend on… the availability of new content that appeals to the broader South African viewership, and the uptake of STBs and integrated digital television sets.” The government will subsidise STBs for the poorest households in the country, as these decoder-like boxes will be necessary to receive new digital TV signals on many existing TVs. “The completion of this programme will also enable the freeing of the critical radio frequency spectrum needed for the rollout of broadband,” it said.
