Samsung has provided details on its Samsung Mobile Care (SMC) programme for the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+. SMC for the new smartphones was announced earlier this week, and gives device owners the option to repair their screen and replace their battery. Users who register for SMC on the Samsung Rewards Platform will receive two screen replacements within a 24-month period. This is limited to one repair every 12 months. Samsung said users will also receive a free battery replacement with each screen repair. Users must register within 30 days of purchasing their new device. Samsung has now detailed the fees involved in the SMC offering for South Africa. The company said if users register for SMC before 30 March 2018, the first six months will be free. “Thereafter you will pay a monthly fee of R69.99,” it said. “If the device is purchased after 30 March, the first month will still be free, and thereafter from month two you will pay a monthly fee of R69.99.” Samsung said there is also an incident fee. “For example, if the screen of your device cracks, for the first month you will pay an excess fee of R1,500, and after the one-month free period you will pay an excess fee of R1,000.”
