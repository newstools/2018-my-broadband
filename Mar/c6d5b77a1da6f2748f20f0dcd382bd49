The Dell EMC Forum 2018, a free one-day technology experience for IT professionals, took place in Johannesburg on 27 March. At the Forum, Dell EMC offered delegates the opportunity to connect with experts and peers, discover strategies, gain insights, and explore solutions that drive IT innovation, enhance workforce mobility, and reduce risk in the digital era. Technology innovation is advancing at an exponential rate, powering a new era of digital transformation. This is why Dell EMC aims to equip customers with what they need to realise their digital future, showing them how to revolutionise their businesses and become more agile and more responsive – while digitising that response. “There are fundamental changes happening in this industry right now, and we haven’t entirely grasped the meaning and significance of all of them,” said Nigel Moulton, EMEA CTO, Converged Platforms and Solutions Division, Dell EMC. According to Doug Woolley, General Manager, Dell EMC South Africa, everyone has the opportunity to grab onto this digital future, and the time to embrace the digital transformation journey is now. “By looking at technology over the course of the past decade, it is evident that there are many changes that have happened and continue to happen, and Dell is at the forefront of driving that change and helping enterprises realise their digital future.” “Digital transformation is a journey that you have to start,” he added. “It’s really about automating your business and digitising your processes so that you can cut overheads, increase agility, and embrace your customers in alternative fashions.”” Moulton delved into Dell Technologies’ mission to help enterprises embrace the digital transformation journey at the forum, explaining what Dell EMC can deliver to the market: 1. Digital transformation: How to embed digital technology into a company’s culture. 2. IT transformation: How to transform the IT delivery that supports the digital transformation a company is going through in terms of people and technology. 3. Workforce transformation: How the nature of work, people, the devices used, and the way they are being use are changing. 4. Security transformation: How to take new approaches to securing corporate resources, both the company’s people and the technology they use. “We see IT as a fundamental piece of investment that we as organisations make, because it drives the way our organisations behave, it drives the front part of our organisation, the way that we do systems of engagements with customers and how it forms the way we do systems of record, and how we then record and keep an audit trail around those interactions,” said Moulton. In South Africa, there is a digital divide in terms of skills, and one of the ways to bridge that gap is through social change by means of partnerships. “Our corporate social responsibility is part of our ethos and part of our DNA, which is why we have invested in partnerships that help drive social change,” said Woolley. This includes the company sponsoring South African teams to go to the world High-Performance Computing Championships, competing against universities from all over the world. Furthermore, over the last few years, Dell EMC has launched 10 digital solar schools in South Africa. As a result of these initiatives. and more, the company has been voted one of the most ethical companies in the world. This forms part of the Dell EMC legacy of effectively building partnerships that are meaningful, and as a result, further endorse their reputation in the industry.
