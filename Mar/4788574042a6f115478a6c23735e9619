MTN has released its financial results for the year ended 31 December 2017. The group reported a revenue figure of R132.8 billion, and a group service revenue figure of R124.4 billion. Digital revenue was R13.0 billion, while total subscriber numbers were reported as 217.2 million. EBITDA increased by 2.5% to R46.9 billion, while EBITDA margin decreased by 1.4 percentage points to 34.0%. A final dividend of 450 cents per share was declared. MTN Group CEO Rob Shuter said MTN delivered a solid overall performance for the year, with progress on many fronts. This was despite “difficult economic conditions as well as operational and regulatory challenges”. “The group’s top-line growth was driven by robust growth in data revenue (on a constant currency basis), supported by the combination of improving customer service and more stable and competitive networks,” said Shuter. “Over the year, we further strengthened our management structures and specialist skill capabilities to drive operational execution and to support our risk management processes.” “We are confident that the foundation is in place for MTN to deliver strong growth over the medium term,” he said.
