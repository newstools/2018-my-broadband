Toys R Us South Africa has experienced phenomenal growth in recent years and is unaffected by the challenges faced by Toys R Us in the US. The statement from Toys R Us South Africa follows an announcement by Toys R Us in the United States that the company is selling or closing all its US stores as part of a liquidation plan. In September 2017, Toys R Us, certain US subsidiaries, and its Canadian subsidiary voluntarily filed for bankruptcy. In South Africa, the situation is vastly different, said the company. Toys R Us South Africa said Toys R Us and Babies R Us South Africa is a privately-owned enterprise. It operates independently from its global counterparts and has shown strong growth, opening seven new local stores in 2017, it said. “We have maintained our momentum. Our revenue growth is solid, and Toys R Us and Babies R Us continues in a clear path of strengthening our brand footprint throughout South Africa,” said the company.
