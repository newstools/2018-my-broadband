EvoNet Telecommunications CEO Brian Seligmann passed away suddenly on Sunday afternoon. Seligmann, an IT and telecoms veteran, started his career with Apple in the early nineties. In 2002, he moved to MTN as a senior manager, where he was responsible for the development, strategy, and management of MTN SAâ€™s messaging and data services. After leaving MTN, he served as the executive head of products and innovation at Cell C, and as the vice president for carrier software and core network solutions at Huawei. Seligmann then founded EvoNet with Crystal Web CEO Shaun Kaplan, a company which deploys and offers broadband and other telecoms products. Seligmann was also a non-executive director at Crystal Web.
