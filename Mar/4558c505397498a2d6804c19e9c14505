Windows 10 launched in South Africa in July 2015, following an extensive programme by Microsoft to encourage users to upgrade. Microsoft offered a free update to the operating system to Windows 7 and 8 users, but not all took the offer. According to the latest figures from Microsoft, however, Windows 10 adoption is steadily increasing. Figures from Windows and Microsoft Store trends show that, as of February 2018, global Windows 10 adoption was 48%. By comparison, in February 2017 Windows 10 adoption was 39%. This is based on PC and tablet user data, which is obtained from users who have opted to send Microsoft their telemetry data. For February 2018, Windows 7 was at 39%, while Windows 8 was at 13%.
