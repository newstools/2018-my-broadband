Microsoft has detailed upcoming features for Windows 10, which will be implemented in the next update for the operating system. A major focus for the next update is improving the Ease of Access features on the platform. Microsoft said it would add new Ease of Access settings, including the ability to increase overall size and brightness of content, and a dedicated page for speech and eye control. The company will also improve the usability of its Narrator tool, adding features for improved reading and writing outcomes while enhancing performance and navigation. Many of these features are currently available in Windows 10 Insider builds.
