Facebook is testing a messaging tool which lets companies broadcast messages to users, TechCrunch reported. The self-service tool allows small businesses who cannot build their own bots to send messages to all users who have started a conversation with them. A public test version of Facebookâ€™s Messenger Broadcast Composer has been rolled out to certain pages in the United States, Mexico, and Thailand. The tool is currently free, but Facebook will reportedly charge businesses to use it in the future. The number of messages which can be sent through the tool are also capped.
