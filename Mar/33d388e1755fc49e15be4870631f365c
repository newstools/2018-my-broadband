Tinder announced it has started rolling out its new social timeline feature to users worldwide. “Feed” shows users real-time updates from their matches, such as when they add new photos or change their profile. Users are also able to comment on individual items, allowing them to easily strike up conversations with matches based on their photos and music interests. By connecting their Spotify account with their Tinder profile, users can share updates to their Top Artists on their Tinder Feed. Users can manage what they share with their matches via the in-app settings.
