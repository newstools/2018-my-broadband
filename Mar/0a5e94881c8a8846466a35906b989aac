SensePost has launched its Managed Detection and Response service – “Managed Threat Detection” – for the enterprise. SensePost’s Managed Threat Detection service provides a managed and proactive solution to organisations looking to strengthen their cybersecurity. The cloud-based solution can easily be deployed by companies and collects data from multiple sources at a customer’s premises. These sources include firewalls, networks, and endpoints – and security devices like honeypots – and do not require agents to be installed by the user. SensePost’s dedicated threat intelligence and research team, working with a proactive threat hunting team, identifies whether alerts indicate an attack or compromise. Detailed reports, delivered in real-time, then enable users to respond to issues as quickly as possible. “Historically, a lot of money has been spent on protecting against threats, and not enough on actually detecting and engaging them,” said Charl van der Walt, Chief Security Strategy Officer at SensePost. “Prevention is stagnating – it’s a futile battle in a cyber game that sees the attackers slowly gaining the edge on distracted and unaware organisations. This is where SensePost can provide value.”
