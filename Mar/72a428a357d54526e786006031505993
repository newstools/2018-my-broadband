BlackBerry is suing Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram over patent infringements related to its BlackBerry Messenger platform. Reuters reported that BlackBerry said Facebook and its subsidiaries copied technology and features from BlackBerry Messenger. The report stated the lawsuit is part of BlackBerry CEO John Chen’s strategy to generate revenue for the company. BlackBerry said in a statement that protecting shareholder assets and intellectual property is the job of every CEO, but denied it was central to BlackBerry’s strategy. “As a cybersecurity and embedded software leader, BlackBerry’s view is that Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp could make great partners in our drive toward a securely-connected future, and we continue to hold this door open to them.” “However, we have a strong claim that Facebook has infringed on our intellectual property, and after several years of dialogue, we also have an obligation to our shareholders to pursue appropriate legal remedies.” Facebook said BlackBerry’s suit “sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business”.
