Google has acquired Tenor, a GIF platform for Android, iOS, and desktop. Tenor was founded in 2014 and backed by a range of investors – including Redpoint Ventures and Menlo Ventures. Tenor has shown exceptional growth since launch, and passed 300 million users in 2017. The acquisition will help the company to execute its mission to help “all three billion mobile users find the perfect way to visually express themselves”. “The acquisition will enable us to accelerate improvements to Tenor’s service for our users, API partners, content partners, and advertisers,” said Tenor. Tenor will continue to operate as a separate brand, it added.
