Open access fibre provider Octotel has announced its plans to pass 100,000 homes within the next year. The company stated that it has passed 60,000 homes in Cape Town to date, and aims to extend its coverage. “We have been overwhelmed by the response from Capetonians and their appetite for fibre,” said Rob Gilmour, Octotel MD. Octotel built over 700km of trenched fibre network covering Cape Town’s Atlantic Seaboard, City Bowl, Southern Suburbs, Blouberg, and Northern Suburbs in 2017, it said. “The network will likely double its size in the next year.” There are 35 ISPs selling FTTH services on the Octotel network, with speeds from 10Mbps up to 1Gbps, it added.
