Playboy has given up on a case where it sued Happy Mutants, the publisher of Boing Boing, for linking to a collection of “Every Playboy Playmate Centerfold Ever”. Playboy accused Boing Boing of copyright infringement for reporting on a historical collection of Playboy centrefolds and linking to an Imgur gallery. A federal court dismissed Playboy’s claims, but gave Playboy permission to try again with a new complaint. The deadline for filing the new complaint passed this week, and Playboy released a statement suggesting it was standing down. “That means both Boing Boing and Playboy can go back to doing what they do best: producing and reporting on culture and technology,” said the EFF.
