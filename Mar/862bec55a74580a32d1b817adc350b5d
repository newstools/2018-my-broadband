Netflix has launched a bug bounty programme through the Bugcrowd platform. The launch builds on Netflix’s responsible disclosure and private bug bounty programme, which has been running for 18 months. Netflix hopes that its public bug bounty will strength its security and its relationship with the security community. Netflix started its responsible vulnerability disclosure programme in 2013 and has received, and remediated, 190 valid issues, it said. The company then launched its private bug bounty in 2016, and has received 145 valid submissions (out of 275 in total) of various criticality levels. “These submissions have helped us improve our external security posture and identify systemic security improvements across our ecosystem,” said Netflix. To date, the highest reward in the Netflix bug bounty programme was $15,000.
