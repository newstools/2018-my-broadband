General Electric has tested the world’s largest jet engine, the GE9XTM. The unit was tested on the company’s Boeing 747 test plane during a flight, and is set to power Boeing’s new 777X aircraft. The engine will be in the “100,000 pound thrust class” and will have a front fan which measures 134 inches in diameter. “Other key features include a next-generation 27:1 pressure-ratio 11-stage high-pressure compressor, and a third-generation TAPS III combustor,” said General Electric. Engine certification is expected in 2019, added the company.
