Upgrading to a solid state drive can make a big difference to your computer’s performance, but faster drives come with a higher price tag. Cloud storage provider Backblaze recently said hard disk drives will still be used in enterprise applications for a long time before they are replaced by SSDs. This is due to the higher price per GB of SSDs compared to mechanical drives. SSDs use flash memory to store data, offering increased speeds and a reduction in moving parts – which increases shock absorption and decreases the footprint of the drive. Conversely, hard drives store data magnetically on spinning platters and are limited by the speed of their mechanical components. To see how big the price differences are, we compared the pricing of 2.5-inch SSDs with that of HDDs to determine the price per GB of each device. All pricing information was taken from Wootware to avoid retailer price differences playing a factor. The cheapest drives available for each capacity were selected for the comparison. The price comparison shows the pricing difference between solid state and mechanical storage, with consumer SSDs costing over 10-times as much as HDDs per GB. It is a high price to pay for the improved speed, but an increasing amount of laptops are shipped with SSDs – due to the substantial performance benefits. Whether you are a gamer looking to shorten your load times, or a travelling professional who wants their device to boot up as quickly as possible, an SSD is a must-have. However, if faster read and write speeds do not greatly affect your PC use, the higher price of a solid state drive may not be worth it.
