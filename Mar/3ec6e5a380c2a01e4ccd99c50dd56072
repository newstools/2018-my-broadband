Facebook Watch – a video service operated by Facebook – will live-stream The Oscars: All Access this weekend. Facebook Watch lets users stream shows on PC and in the Facebook TV apps. The Oscars: All Access provides viewers with backstage coverage at the 90th Academy Awards – including interviews, red carpet coverage, and behind-the-scenes footage. The Oscars: All Access does not include coverage of the Oscars awards ceremony, however. It should be noted that geographic blocking may be applied, which means South Africans may be blocked by Facebook Watch.
