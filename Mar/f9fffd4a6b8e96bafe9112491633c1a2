Cloudflare now has a data centre presence in Durban and Port Louis, Mauritius. This expands the Cloudflare network to 137 cities globally, said the company. “Just in March, so far, we’ve launched new data centres across Beirut, Phnom Penh, Kathmandu, Istanbul, Reykjavík, Riyadh, Macau, and Baghdad,” it said. Cloudflare’s first deployment in Africa was in Johannesburg three years ago. Since then, it has expanded to Cape Town and several other African cities. “Durban is our third deployment in South Africa, where mobile adoption continues to drive traffic growth amongst 20 million Internet users.” “In addition to better serving KwaZulu-Natal, our Durban data centre will provide additional redundancy and expand the surface area for Cloudflare to withstand potential DDoS attacks.” “We are participants at two interconnection points: NAP Africa IX Durban and DINX (Durban Internet Exchange),” it said.
