Telkom has announced price increases to its services, due to the upcoming VAT hike. “Dear Customer, the Minister of Finance announced an increase in VAT from 14% to 15%, effective 1 April 2018,” Telkom told customers in a message. “Our products and services are subject to VAT and therefore the increase in VAT will result in price adjustments.” “The updated rates will be available on our website from 31 March 2018. We value your continued support,” said Telkom. The company’s announcement follows similar price hike statements from Vodacom, MTN, and Cell C.
