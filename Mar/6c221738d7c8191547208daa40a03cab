Multiple South African government websites on the gov.za domain are down this morning. Attempts by MyBroadband to visit several sites – including https://www.gov.za/ – saw pages failing to load. Information from IsItDown also stated that gov.za was not reachable for users. MyBroadband contacted SITA for comment on the downtime, but the organisation was not immediately available. The gov.za downtime this morning follows prolonged downtime for the SA Post Office website last week.
