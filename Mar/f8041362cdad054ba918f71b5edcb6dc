MTN has announced price changes to certain prepaid call rates, which will take effect from 23 March 2018. MTN has sent messages to MTN “Pay Per Second” and “Talk Free” price plan customers, informing them of the new call rates. MTN executive Jacqui O’Sullivan told MyBroadband that a portfolio and pricing overhaul for post-paid products was initiated in 2017, and that a similar roadmap was put in place for prepaid products in 2018. “Earlier this month, we introduced new data bundles. We have introduced the MyMTNOffers, and we will be rolling out a series of new products over the next three months, all in line with the transformation of our prepaid portfolio,” said O’Sullivan. She said that certain products will be affected in different ways as this takes place. “In some areas, there will be price decreases, in others there’ll be increases, and others will remain the same. Our focus is to create a product portfolio that better supports what our customers require from us and allows us to move away from outdated legacy products that no longer meet our customers’ needs.” O’Sullivan said the price changes that take place on 23 March are part of the prepaid overhaul, and not linked to recent VAT-related price hikes. “At any time, customers may change their plans if they decide they would prefer to migrate to a different option. Customers can simply dial *141*0# and select option 5.”
