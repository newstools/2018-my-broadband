The Internet Society and African IXP Association will hold the 9th annual Africa Peering and Interconnection Forum in Cape Town, hosted by the Internet Service Providers’ Association (ISPA). The event will be held from 21-23 August 2018, in conjunction with iWeek. ISPA said the forum is aimed at expanding the Internet in Africa, connecting infrastructure, service, and content providers with policymakers. “We are delighted to be hosting AfPIF at iWeek for the very first time. This is a fantastic example of the kind of pan-African ICT cooperation envisioned by the Abuja and OR Tambo declarations of the 1990s,” said ISPA Chair Graham Beneke.
