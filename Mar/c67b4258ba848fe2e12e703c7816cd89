ICASA recently released its latest tariff report, which reveals a huge difference between in-bundle and out-of-bundle (OOB) data prices. The regulator’s tariff report is based on 160 tariff notifications which it received between 1 July 2017 and 31 December 2017. It also included an analysis of standard prepaid data tariffs, which compared the in-bundle and out-of-bundle data prices of South Africa’s major mobile operators. ICASA’s analysis shows the difference between the fee for a data bundle, and the equivalent out-of-bundle price for the same data volume on that network. The results are telling, with the in-bundle and OOB difference as high as R21,729 for a 20GB data bundle. The table below shows ICASA’s analysis of in-bundle and out-of-bundle data prices.
