If you already have a Spotify subscription, your switch to the local offering will be seamless, said the company. Spotify representatives said that when you log in from South Africa you will be able to change your region, and your payment method, to access the South African price. You won’t lose any of your playlists and there will be no difference between its South African catalogue and what it has on offer internationally. Only a “very very tiny amount of content” may not be available in one market that is available in another. This is due to minor differences in global licensing, said Spotify. “There will absolutely be no geoblocking when traveling internationally,” it said. Features such as personalised Discover Weekly playlists will be available immediately. New subscribers will have to wait a few days for the service to learn about their listening habits, however. The announcement comes after the service launched in South Africa on 12 March. Spotify currently only offers the option to pay by credit card. The ability to generate gift vouchers on its website, which are bought by credit card, are also available. Spotify said it is also exploring local partnerships with network operators – looking at integrated billing and zero-rating data for its service. It is also investigating alternative payment methods, such as vouchers. Spotify expects to launch family and student pricing options in the country in the future, it said.
