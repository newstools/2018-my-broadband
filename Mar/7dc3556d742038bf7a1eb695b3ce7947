Spotify bought the BitTorrent client uTorrent in 2006 to bring in star programmer Ludvig Strigeus, Breakit.se reported. Spotify then sold uTorrent to the developers of BitTorrent, BitTorrent Inc. When Spotify initially bought uTorrent, the assumption was that it wanted to build on its technology for its own peer-to-peer distribution system, reported Breakit.se. However, former Spotify CTO Andreas Ehn said that was not the case – they wanted Strigeus. While his current shareholding is unknown, a 2009 ComputerSweden article reported that Strigeus held a 2.6% share of Spotify. This has led to speculation that Spotify has made the developer a Swedish billionaire.
