Google Lens, the object recognition software, is now available on iOS. Lens allows a smartphone camera to detect objects and pulls up relevant information to the user. The feature is available on version 3.15 of the Google Photos iOS app, and Google noted that Lens activity will be saved to the userâ€™s Google account if the web and app activity setting is enabled. Google Lens will continue rolling out to iOS users over the next week.
