Twitter has introduced Bookmarks, which makes it easier to share Tweets or save them for access later. “With our new share icon on every Tweet, you’ll be able to bookmark a Tweet, share via Direct Message, or share off of Twitter any number of ways,” said Twitter. To bookmark a Tweet, users tap the share icon under the Tweet and select “Add Tweet to Bookmarks”. To find it later, users can tap “Bookmarks” from their profile icon menu. Bookmarks are rolling out globally on Twitter for iOS and Android, Twitter Lite, and mobile.twitter.com.
