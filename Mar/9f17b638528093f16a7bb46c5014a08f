The National Assembly has approved legislation that aims to allow the FPB to regulate the distribution of online content in South Africa. Known as the Internet Censorship Bill, the Film and Publications Amendment Bill includes provisions to give the FPB powers to have online content blocked in South Africa. This includes “user-generated content”, such as posts published to Facebook, Twitter, and other social media services. According to reports, the National Assembly vote was 189 in favour, 35 against, and no abstentions. Having gone through the National Assembly, the Bill must now be debated and approved in the National Council of Provinces before it can be sent to President Cyril Ramaphosa to be signed into law. According to the government, the aim is to protect children from sexually-explicit material, and curb hate speech and revenge porn. Opposition parties and detractors of the Bill have warned that it is unenforceable, however, and in many cases it is unconstitutional.
