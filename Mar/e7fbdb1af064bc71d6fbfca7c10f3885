2018 will be the year when smartphone usage broadens into artificial intelligence and becomes more “inclusive” into our daily lives. This is the view of LG Mobile South Africa’s GM Deon Prinsloo, who further predicts that the use of smartphones is set to increase significantly. According to the recent Deloitte TMT report, smartphone owners will interact with their phones on average 65 times per day in 2023 – which is a 20% increase over 2018. This increased use presents a big market for LG to tap into, and “constantly position what we have to differentiate ourselves”, said Prinsloo. The report further predicts that by 2023, 5G networks should have launched in most developed markets, offering much greater capacity and connectivity speeds. Prinsloo said LG is in the process of refining its smartphone ranges to be more aligned to this migration. Prinsloo said LG has positioned its range of smartphones as an innovative and value-rich proposition, receiving a favourable response from South African consumers. This has resulted in strong demand for LG’s premium and super-premium product offers in the country, with the LG G6 leading sales. “This has allowed us to expand our V Series product offering to multiple carriers in 2017,” said Prinsloo. He added that South Africans can look forward to several new models this year, with a strong focus on LG’s G and V product ranges.
