The Sunday Times has reported that despite denials from the authorities, arrest warrants have been issued for Atul and Tony Gupta. In February, reports suggested the Gupta brothers were on the run, and that the Hawks issued arrest warrants for the brothers and Duduzane Zuma. The SABC reported that Interpol has also been roped in to track down Atul and Tony Gupta, after the Hawks were unable to serve warrants of arrest. According to the report, Atul and Tony Gupta were out of the country when the warrants were issued – likely in India or Dubai. Ajay Gupta has also been declared a fugitive from justice. This comes after he failed to hand himself over – despite his lawyers telling the Hawks he will do so. Lieutenant-General Yolisa Matakata of the Hawks confirmed that a warrant of arrest has been issued for Ajay Gupta. The arrest warrant is not in connection with the Vrede dairy farm project, but another corruption case – reportedly attempted bribery of former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas. However, Matakata denied there was a warrant of arrest for Duduzane Zuma. The Hawks have also said they are not looking for Atul Gupta. eNCA spoke to the Gupta family’s lawyers, and they dismissed allegations the brothers are fugitives from justice. “Insiders said the denial was part of a plot to lure the two brothers back into the country,” stated the Sunday Times.
