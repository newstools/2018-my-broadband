Google will introduce video advertisements in its Google Play Store. The new feature forms part of Google’s Universal App campaigns. “Universal App campaigns use Google’s machine learning technology to find loyal fans across Google.com, Google Play, YouTube, and over 3 million sites and apps in the Google Display Network,” it said. “Over the next few months, we’ll roll out a beta for video ads – a new way to reach players on Google Play with sight, sound, and motion.” Based on Google’s animation demonstrating the feature, the video will appear in the advertising scroller in Google Play, but will require you to tap on it before it plays. In a sea of mobile apps, it’s critical to reach the right players at the right time and place, said Google.
