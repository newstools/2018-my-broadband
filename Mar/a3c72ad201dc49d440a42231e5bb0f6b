Toys R Us employees have been informed that the company is selling or closing all its US stores as part of a liquidation plan. According to USA Today, Toys R Us will file liquidation papers in advance of a court hearing scheduled for Thursday afternoon. “Chief Executive Dave Brandon shared the news with employees in a conference call,” reported USA Today. Brandon said it was a sad day to see the brand disappear. In September 2017, Toys R Us, certain US subsidiaries, and its Canadian subsidiary voluntarily filed for bankruptcy. Toys R Us is the world’s leading dedicated toy and baby products retailer, with approximately 1,600 stores worldwide.
