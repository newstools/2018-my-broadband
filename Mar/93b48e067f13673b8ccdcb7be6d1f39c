Google has unveiled its new Bristlecone quantum computer, which comprises 72 qubits while maintaining low error rates. Google said its Bristlecone chip demonstrates 1% error rates for readout, 0.1% for single-qubit gates, and 0.6% for two-qubit gates. The processor aims to achieve quantum supremacy in the near future. Quantum supremacy refers to the ability of a quantum computer to perform well-defined computational tasks better then advanced classical computers, without error correction. “We believe Bristlecone would then be a compelling proof-of-principle for building larger-scale quantum computers,” said Google.
