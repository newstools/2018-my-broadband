Gridhost has announced price increases across its services, which are due to the upcoming hike in VAT and increasing operating costs. “We’ve done our best to keep the adjustment aligned with the current rate of inflation and the new VAT rate,” said Gridhost in an email to clients. As with the VAT increase, Gridhost’s new prices will kick in on 1 April.
