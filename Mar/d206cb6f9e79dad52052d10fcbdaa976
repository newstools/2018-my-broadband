Casio is reviving its classic SL-880-N “Game Calculator”, which was a hit in the 80s. The Casio SL-880-N features a 10-column LCD screen, 2-way solar and battery power, and the ability to play music and simple games. It sports all the basic functions of a calculator, including memory keys and square root calculations. Its flagship feature is its Digital Invader game, which is a Space Invaders-type game using two keys. The calculator is listed for 1,980 yen (around R220).
