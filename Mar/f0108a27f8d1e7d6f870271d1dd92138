Sony has unveiledÂ the pricing and availability of its new A8F Bravia OLED TVs, and new X900F and X850F 4K TVs. The A8F OLED TVs feature a one-slate design, which makes them easy to mount on a wall. The A8F OLED TVs will also support Dolby Vision via a firmware update to be delivered later this year. The X850F series features a 4K HDR processor, which together with 4K X-Reality PRO up-converts SD and HD content to near-4K HDR quality. The TVs are available for presale at major retailers.
