Google has added short posts from musicians in its search results, which are displayed in the Knowledge Panel. “The next time you’re wondering about Lorde’s upcoming tour dates or Steve Aoki’s new music video, you can hear the update directly from them through a post in Search,” said Google. The Knowledge Panel will display images, videos, GIFs, and text posted directly by the artist a user is searching for. “You can easily tell if the updates are from a verified musician – posts will be marked with a blue checkmark next to their name.” The feature is now live for all musicians.
