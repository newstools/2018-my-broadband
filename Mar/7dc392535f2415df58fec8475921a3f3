Google has launched a cloud text-to-speech conversion service powered by machine learning technology from DeepMind. The service offers developers the ability to synthesise speech using 30 voices, available in multiple languages and variants. “It applies DeepMind’s groundbreaking research in WaveNet and Google’s powerful neural networks to deliver the highest fidelity possible,” said Google. “As an easy-to-use API, you can create lifelike interactions with your users, across many applications and devices.” Cloud text-to-speech is priced per 1 million characters of text processed, after a free tier. Standard, non-WaveNet voices grant 4 million free characters per month, after which they are billed at $4 per 1 million characters. WaveNet-based voices have 1 million free characters per month and are then billed at $16 per million characters.
