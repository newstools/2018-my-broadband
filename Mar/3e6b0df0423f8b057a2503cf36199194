The ANC resolved at its 54th National Conference to conclude a review of South Africa’s broadcasting policy. It added it would aim to attain a quota of 70% local content within five years for TV and radio in the country. According to the resolution, the policy should apply to the entire broadcasting landscape – and not only the SABC. “[It] should be underpinned by the desire to create a diverse broadcasting landscape,” said the ANC. “The local content industry development strategy should be introduced without delay, alongside the review of the broadcasting policy and in line with the digital broadcasting plan.” The resolution comes after former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng implemented a 90% local content quota at the SABC. When Motsoeneng was ousted from the position, the interim board reversed the policy. The ANC also touched on the “existing monopoly in the pay television market”. It resolved to, through government policy and competition interventions, ensure a fair and regulated subscription broadcasting television market by addressing competition issues. This comes after ICASA launched an inquiry into South Africa’s subscription TV market, and found that MultiChoice had significant market power The company enjoyed a 98.1% market share in the subscription TV space, it said. It also found that MultiChoice owns the lion’s share of the rights to Hollywood movies, in addition to the bulk of the rights to live sports broadcasting in South Africa.
