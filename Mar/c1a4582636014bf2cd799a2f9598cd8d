Cell C was the first operator to offer out-of-bundle rates as low as 15c per MB – on its 66c prepaid tariff plan – and has extended this rate to its Connector contract plans. However, there is still a big difference between in-bundle and out-of-bundle prices for many of its data products. Many contract packages also offer better value for money than once-off or recurring bundles. Cell C said that purchasing a combo package or a bulk service is often cheaper than purchasing data products bit by bit. “When a customer commits to purchase a bundle, we have an indication as to the capacity we require to provide for customers,” said Cell C. “As a result of an upfront commitment when customers sign a 24-month contract, we can offer better data rates when compared to an ad-hoc data bundle.” Cell C added that its 30-day data bundles apply to both contract and prepaid customers, and cost the same. Pricing for its once-off and recurring bundles are also the same, and unused data carries over automatically on recurring bundles. Cell C said it actively drives users to purchase bundles and reduce their out-of-bundle usage through campaigns and promotions. The table below shows the price-per-MB for Cell C’s 30-day data bundles – revealing that bigger packages provide better prices.
