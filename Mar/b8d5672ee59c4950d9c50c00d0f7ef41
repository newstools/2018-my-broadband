Gamers and cryptocurrency miners were almost completely unmentioned in Nvidia’s keynote at its annual GPU Technology Conference, Digital Trends reported. Instead, Nvidia showed off the new Quadro GV100 card aimed at graphics professionals, a medical imaging supercomputer called Clara, and what it calls the world’s largest GPU – the Nvidia DGX-2. The DGX-2 is a $400,000 “mini” GPU supercomputer designed for deep learning applications that weighs around 160kg. It features 16 Tesla V100 graphics processors, each with 32GB of memory. Gamers and miners were expecting an announcement from Nvidia around next-generation graphics cards designed for cryptocurrency mining. Demand for graphics cards has rocketed in recent months, due to miners buying large quantities and driving up prices.
