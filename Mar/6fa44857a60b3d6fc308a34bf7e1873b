Huawei launched its new lineup of P20 flagship smartphones on 27 March, which included the P20 Pro and P20. The new devices feature almost bezel-less displays with a notch at the top for their high-resolution front-facing cameras, and boast high-end specifications. Huawei unveiled the new smartphones at a launch event hosted at the Grand Palais in Paris, France. MyBroadband attended the event to cover the launch, and it was a spectacular gathering. Photos from the Huawei P20 launch event in Paris are posted below.
