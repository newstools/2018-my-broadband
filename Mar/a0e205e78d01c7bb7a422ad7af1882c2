Porsche is developing designs for flying passenger drones, according to a report by Automobilwoche. The report stated that the carmaker will soon reveal its first design sketch for a flying taxi. Porsche’s passenger drones will function similarly to Uber’s planned passenger drones, granting the passenger an optional degree of piloting control without requiring them to have a pilot’s licence. According to Porsche sales lead Detlev von Platen, the drones could turn a half-an-hour drive into a three-and-a-half-minute ride.
