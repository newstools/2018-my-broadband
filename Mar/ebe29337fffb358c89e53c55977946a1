Samsung’s Galaxy S9 and S9+ smartphones are now available in South Africa. The new flagship devices offer notable improvements over current smartphones, and the previous-generation Galaxy S8 and S8+. The Galaxy S9 and S9+ boast a new dual-aperture rear camera, which allows for high-quality photos regardless of whether they are taken in bright or low-light conditions. Samsung has also added powerful video features to the Galaxy S9’s camera, allowing it to record slow-motion video at a staggering 960 frames-per-second. Extra features built into the camera app – like Bixby Vision, which allows you to automatically translate real-world text – are included, too. The Galaxy S9 retains the InfinityEdge display implemented on the Galaxy S8 range, and backs it up with a more powerful and power-efficient CPU. The device also no longer places the fingerprint sensor next to the camera lens, but below it. This allows for easier accessibility and prevents users from smudging the glass over their camera lens. The specifications of the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S8, along with their recommended pricing at launch, are detailed below.
