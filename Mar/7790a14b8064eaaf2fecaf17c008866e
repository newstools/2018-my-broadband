Waze is offering advertising options for small businesses through a new service called Local. This complements Waze’s existing advertising services. TechCrunch reported that Waze Local has been in beta testing since 2016. When you buy an ad on Waze Local, the basic format is a branded pin, which will appear on user screens as they drive near a business location. It also lets businesses promote themselves in Waze’s search results, and offers a “zero speed takeover” – which displays a banner when the vehicle is at a complete stop. A basic Waze Local package starts from $2 per day. Waze Local Plus runs from $100 per day and lets businesses advertise in more locations and offers zero speed takeovers. Companies will also get a dedicated account manager.
