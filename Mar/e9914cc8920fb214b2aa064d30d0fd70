Microsoft will add AMD FreeSync support for the Xbox One X and Xbox One S consoles, The Verge reported. Support for AMDâ€™s variable refresh rate monitors will be implemented in the upcoming Xbox spring update, which will also include 1440p support for monitors. The addition of these features will allow gamers with FreeSync PC monitors to use them with their Xbox consoles. FreeSync removes screen tearing by dynamically changing the refresh rate of the display to match the frames per second outputted by a GPU. Microsoft said it would also add support for auto low-latency mode on compatible TVs, improving latency during gameplay.
