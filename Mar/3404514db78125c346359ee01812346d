MTN’s financial results for the year ended 31 December 2017 detail its mobile subscriber numbers in South Africa. As listed companies, it is a requirement for Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom to release these figures. MTN’s latest results also contained a note about its subscriber numbers, stating it had reviewed its subscriber definitions in line with modern standards. “With the previous subscriber definition, all customers whose MSISDNs are active on the network were counted, whereas with the new subscriber definition only customers who recharge on the network are counted,” said MTN spokeswoman Jacqui O’Sullivan. “The new subscriber definitions that MTN has rolled out is to ensure that MTN is consistent across operations for defining subscribers.” O’Sullivan added that quarterly subscriber definitions are volatile for the overall South African market, dependent on various promotions. MTN’s results showed it had 29.5 million mobile subscribers in South Africa. The company’s results did not reflect its postpaid and prepaid subscriber share. Vodacom’s trading update for the latest quarter showed it had 41.6 million subscribers. Telkom’s latest financial results reflected an active mobile subscriber base of 4.4 million. Cell C’s financial results for the year ended 31 December 2017 showed it had 16.3 million active subscribers.
