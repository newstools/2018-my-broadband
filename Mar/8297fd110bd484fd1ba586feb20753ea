MyBroadband’s Speed Test App is now used by thousands of South Africans to test their mobile networks. MyBroadband’s Speed Test App is free to download and use, is ad-free, and allows users to test the download speed, upload speed, and latency of their Internet connection. Testing your mobile speed provides us with valuable information about mobile network quality and which suburbs need attention, and allows network operators to improve their services. To celebrate the big growth in the Speed Test App and its user base, we are giving away R6,000 in prizes – R2,000 cash, mystery gadgets, and branded gear – to users who conduct mobile network speed tests. To enter the giveaway, here is what you must do: Please note that mobile data used for speed tests on your mobile network will count towards your monthly usage allowance, and these speed tests can use a lot of data when testing a high-speed network. Good news is that MTN has zero-rated the MyBroadband Speed Test App, which means MTN subscribers will not be charged for the data used when running speed tests. The giveaway winners will be selected and announced on 26 March.
