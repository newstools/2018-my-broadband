Merriam-Webster has added 850 new words and definitions to its dictionary, including a definition for “cryptocurrency”. The dictionary’s editors monitor global trends regarding the public adoption of new words and their use in speech. The word “ICO” was also added to the dictionary, defined as “an initial offering of a cryptocurrency to the public”. The definition for cryptocurrency is: Any form of currency that only exists digitally, that usually has no central issuing or regulating authority, but instead uses a decentralised system to record transactions and manage the issuance of new units, and that relies on cryptography to prevent counterfeiting and fraudulent transactions.
