Marco Arment, the programmer behind Overcast, has launched Overcast 4.1. Overcast 4.1 brings new features to podcast enthusiasts, including smart resume: “Both are subtle but noticeable benefits, especially when you’re being interrupted a lot, such as while following turn-by-turn navigation directions,” said Arment. Other improvements include deleting episodes 24-hours after completion, and password-protected podcasts. “Some private podcast feeds, including many paid and members-only podcasts, require a username and password via HTTP Basic Auth. You can now add these in the Add URL screen,” he said.
