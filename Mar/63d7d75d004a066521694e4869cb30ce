Facebook has informed advertisers that it will shut down Partner Categories, which allowed detailed targeting. Partner Categories were based on information provided by Facebook marketing partners, which used data provided by the social media platform. These categories allowed advertisers to refine their targeting based on information compiled by Facebook’s partners – such as offline demographic and behavioural information. Facebook said it is stopping the categories and will wind them down over the next six months. It added that while it is “common industry practice”, its decision will improve user’s privacy on Facebook.
