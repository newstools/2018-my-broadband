Uber has reached a settlement with the family of a woman killed by an Uber self-driving car, reported Reuters. The woman was killed when she was hit by the car while crossing a dark road, pushing her bicycle, in Arizona. The report stated that the settlement means there will not be a legal battle over the accident, which was expected to take place. An attorney working on the case said “the matter has been resolved”, but declined to provide the terms of the settlement. The family of the victim declined to comment on the matter.
