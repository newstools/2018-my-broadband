MyBroadband recently purchased four new SIM cards, one from Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, and Telkom. When we visited the operators’ retail stores to purchase the SIMs, we asked in-store assistants for a basic prepaid SIM on their standard plan. This ensures that each SIM would be placed on its respective operator’s default prepaid tariff plan, allowing us to compare the standard rates. We placed the SIMs in identical Nokia 5 smartphones and used the USSD menu to identify which tariff plans they had been placed on by the operators. After determining the tariff plan for each SIM, we could find the call, SMS, and out-of-bundle data rates for each standard tariff plan. The default tariff plans applied to each of our prepaid SIM cards – along with their call, SMS, and data rates – are listed below. The MTN base plan features flat rates.  Vodacom’s Power Bonus plans grants users an extra 50% of their airtime purchases in additional airtime, valid for a day.  Cell C’s EasyChat plan includes its MegaData benefits, which reward users with free data.  On this plan, a user’s airtime is doubled every time they recharge with R5 or more. This free airtime expires after 7 days.
