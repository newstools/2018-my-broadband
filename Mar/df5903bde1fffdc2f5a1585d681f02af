Facebook has introduced video chat in Messenger Lite, a slimmed-down version of Messenger for Android. Messenger Lite offers the core features of Facebook Messenger, and it intended for people with older Android devices or slow Internet connections. Text messages, photos, and links can be sent via Messenger Lite to users with Messenger Lite or Messenger. Audio calls, and now video chats, can also be placed. “Video chats are incredibly popular for people who use the Messenger core app,” said Facebook. “Now people who use Messenger Lite can have the same rich and expressive face-to-face conversations.”
