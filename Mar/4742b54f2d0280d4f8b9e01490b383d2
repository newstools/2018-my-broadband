Microsoft said it is “going all out” for the launch of its biggest new intellectual property, Sea of Thieves. At 19:00 on 13 March, David “The Bullet” Smith will attempt to break a Guinness World Record for the “Greatest Distance Travelled as a Human Cannonball”. Smith will use the Xbox Pirate Blaster – a 5,400kg, 10m long cannon that will accelerate him from 0 to about 100km/h in a fifth of a second. He will blast off at upwards of 10G and attempt a 61-metre cannon shot before hitting the landing airbag. Sea of Thieves is set to launch for Xbox One and Windows on 20 March.
