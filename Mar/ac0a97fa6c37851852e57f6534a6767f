MTN has launched its new Mass SIM card. The MTN Mass SIM card offers users “double the airtime and data bundles value” when they recharge. “South Africans now double-up their airtime and data bundles when recharging with MTN’s new Mass SIM for R5 or more,” said MTN. The Mass SIM is available to all new MTN prepaid customers, and the bonus airtime and data bundles are valid for 24 hours once activated. “This new Mass SIM is yet another way that MTN ensures that customers are always connected across the country.”
