Huawei recently unveiled its MateBook X Pro, which is set to compete against Apple’s MacBook Pro. The MateBook X Pro packs impressive hardware, and features a 3K resolution touchscreen, 8th-gen Intel Core CPU, and Nvidia graphics. According to Huawei, the MateBook X Pro’s display is brighter and clearer than Apple’s Retina displays, and is the world’s first FullView Touchscreen on a notebook. The MateBook X Pro, which is set to launch in South Africa later this year, is set to be a formidable competitor. To see how it compares to Apple’s flagship laptop, we compared the specifications and pricing of the MateBook X Pro and MacBook Pro – detailed below. The Apple MacBook Pro and Huawei Matebook X Pro are available in numerous models with different specifications and pricing. For our comparison, we used the best available models. Huawei told MyBroadband the MateBook X Pro will arrive in South Africa in the middle of 2018. Local pricing for MateBook X Pro is yet to be finalised, but recommended prices should be between R23,999 and R29,999. Three Huawei MateBook X models have been announced to date: Apple’s MacBook Pro is available in either 13-inch or 15-inch models, and pricing can vary according to storage capacity and processor model. Local pricing for a range of Apple MacBook Pro models available in South Africa is below. The 13-inch MacBook Pro and MateBook X Pro models are priced similarly, and each device includes its own unique features. The MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar is a useful tool which can be used to display information or control the device, improving accessibility for users. The MateBook X Pro, on the other hand, sports a touchscreen, which may suit users who utilise applications enhanced for touchscreen use. Huawei and Apple’s laptops are also quite similar in terms of design, but Huawei claims its bezel-less displays with high resolutions are superior. Despite removing almost all the bezels, Huawei managed to squeeze a webcam into the device – which sits in the keyboard and hides itself away when not in use. Both devices boast impressive performance in the graphics department, making use of the latest mobile GPUs from AMD and Nvidia. The MacBook Pro’s AMD Radeon Pro 560 and the MateBook X Pro’s Nvidia GeForce MX150 will be up to the task of professional editing and processing, while their Intel Core processors can handle most tasks with ease. The big difference is on the software side, with the Huawei laptop running Windows 10 and the Apple machine MacOS. Choosing between these devices may therefore depend on which operating system you prefer and the software you have to run on it.
