ICASA said it has received four applications for Individual Commercial Free-to-Air Television Broadcasting Service Licences. Among the applicants is Infinity Media Networks, the parent of former Gupta-owned news network ANN7. The company previously applied for a free-to-air TV licence in 2014, during ICASA’s last Invitation to Apply. ICASA disqualified all five respondents in 2016. ICASA said at the time that there was non-compliance related to foreign ownership, finances, ownership by historically-disadvantaged persons, and cross media ownership that exceeded the regulatory provisions. ICASA issued the new Invitation to Apply on 28 February 2017. Along with the service licences, respondents also applied for radio frequency spectrum licences in MUX 3 – a range of frequencies for digital terrestrial television in South Africa. ICASA invited public comments on the applications, which should reach it by 4 April 2018. Applicants may then respond to the comments before 25 April. The following companies applied for broadcast and spectrum licences from ICASA:
