Sony has announced that its PlayStation Plus free-games service will longer include PS3 and PS Vita titles in 2019. The service gives subscribers free games each month, but PS3 and PS Vita titles will fall away after 8 March 2019. “Any PS3 or PS Vita Monthly Games downloaded or previously added to your Download List will remain playable for as long as you remain a PlayStation Plus member,” said Sony. After 8 March 2019, Monthly Games will only include PlayStation 4 titles. All other features and benefits of the PlayStation Plus service remain unaffected.
