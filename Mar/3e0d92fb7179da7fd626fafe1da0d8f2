Trudon recently announced it would remove its name from the Yellow Pages and “fully embrace the heritage of the brand.” From 1 April, the Yellow Pages will no longer state that they are “brought to you by Trudon”. It will receive a new look and feel, including a new logo, along with a new brand positioning and strategy to increase its share with a younger and digitally-savvy audience. The strategy also includes products and bundles for its existing clients, said Trudon. As part of this, a Yellow Pages app is relaunching, which will eventually see over 100,000 small and medium businesses registered. “This means that the convenience of the old days is now available at your fingertips. The Yellow Pages app, like the book, is a database of every local service provider you could possibly need in your day to day life,” said the company. The app will feature a chat function which lets users chat to potential suppliers. It also lets you see average prices, as well as ratings and reviews of companies. “All of these features mean this platform guarantees that your search will yield a find.” While the Yellow Pages lays claim to running the largest online database of local businesses and services in South Africa, its printed edition is no longer the substantial tome it used to be. Where the Yellow Pages was previously double the thickness of the White Pages, the two books are now combined into a single volume.
