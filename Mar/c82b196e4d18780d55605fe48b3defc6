The ZA Domain Name Authority’s (ZADNA) discussion document on second level domain names is “exceptionally ill-timed”. This is according to the ZA Central Registry (ZACR), following ZADNA publishing the discussion document. “SA’s ICT sector is in a state of flux, with important documents currently before Parliament that include the ICT Sector Commission and Tribunal Bill,” said the ZACR. “This makes last month’s publishing by ZADNA… especially ill-timed.” The ZACR said a rushed discussion around the complex domain name industry threatens its “highly-effective central registry model”. “We support in principle the ability to register new domain names immediately below the top level domain. However, we cannot support the bad timing of a good idea,” said ZACR CEO Lucky Masilela. The ZACR is also not convinced that the “current ease of registering and provisioning .za domains” will continue under the proposed changes. It added that the discussion document seemingly ignores the domain name sector inputs on the ICT White Paper. “Aside from poor timing, the ZADNA discussion document also appears to put forward interfering with the administration of the .capetown, .durban, and .joburg gTLDs – which will not go down well with the delegator of these domains, ICANN, which will see any moves in this direction as a gross violation of the gTLD delegation terms and conditions.” The ZACR said it is responsible for the technical and administrative wellbeing of South Africa’s presence on the web.
