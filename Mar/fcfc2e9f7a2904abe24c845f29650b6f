MSI has launched the Vigor GK80 and GK70 gaming keyboards as the latest additions to its Gaming Gear line of peripherals. With a strong focus on illumination using MSI’s exclusive Mystic Light, both the Vigor GK80 and GK70 allow gamers to fully customise their setup down to each individual key. Both models have a premium base crafted out of anodised aluminium, giving them a solid feel, and their floating key design makes them easy to clean. Replaceable keycaps are included in two varieties – 12 with a rubber textured finish and 4 with a metal surface to help gamers instantly find the right keys. Both keyboards also feature Cherry MX RGB LED switches and exclusive hotkeys linked to MSI’s Gaming App when paired with specific MSI GAMING series components. The Vigor GK80 is a full-sized keyboard which uses either Cherry MX Red or Speed Silver switches and includes dedicated media keys and a detachable palm rest.  The GK70 is a smaller, tenkeyless keyboard which sports either Cherry MX Speed Silver or Red switches, and a combination of metal and rubber keycaps.  Gamers can customise their keyboards’ appearance by choosing from millions of colours and multiple effects using MSI’s exclusive Mystic Light software. Mystic Light Sync allows gamers to easily synchronise colours and effects with other RGB components and peripherals for a full system display.  The MSI Vigor GK80 and GK70 gaming keyboards are expected to be in stores worldwide from March 2018. To obtain more information, please visit the MSI website.
