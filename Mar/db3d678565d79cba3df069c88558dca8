The Deals Article is one day early this week, as the long Easter weekend starts tomorrow. If you are driving somewhere, drive safe, and please don’t use your smartphone while behind the wheel. Even if it is to check this week’s deals, or any article on MyBroadband – smartphone usage and texting while driving is never a good idea. Happy Easter and enjoy the tech deals this week.
