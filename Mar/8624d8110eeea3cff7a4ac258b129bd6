Teraco is set to expand its Cape Town data centre, as it grows its footprint in South Africa. Teraco CEO Lex van Wyk said that due to the increased commercialisation of cloud services, Teraco Cape Town will be upgraded and extended. “The expansion of Cape Town is strategic to Teraco and in line with the rising demand for power-dense environments of today’s cloud-driven businesses,” said van Wyk. Its planned expansion of the Cape Town data centre will result in a facility five-times larger than the original footprint completed in early 2009. “Teraco’s Durban data centre, the smallest of its regional facilities, is also on an upgrade path due to increased demand.” Van Wyk added that Teraco’s total power provision has grown to 50MW, “nearly doubling annually since opening its doors in 2008”.
