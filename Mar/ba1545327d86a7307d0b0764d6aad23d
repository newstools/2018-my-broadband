SEACOM has deployed 100Gbps Ethernet technology in its data centre PoPs (Points of Presence) in Teraco Johannesburg and Teraco Cape Town. The company said this is one of the first deployments of the technology in sub-Saharan Africa. By upgrading its router and switch infrastructure at the Teraco data centres, SEACOM has activated up to 400Gbps of routing bandwidth at each facility – and will be able to scale both PoPs to 3.2Tbps and beyond. The company said the upgrade also enables it to scale up the capacity it has acquired on the WACS undersea cable. “This investment will enable us to grow our network and customer base, while continuing to provide a reliable and consistent experience to African businesses, service providers and consumers,” said SEACOM head of engineering Mark Tinka.
