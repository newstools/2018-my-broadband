Intel has revealed the Intel Optane SSD 800P, promising high speeds, low latency, and excellent endurance. The Optane SSD 800P enables fast system boots, speedy application load times, and smooth multitasking, said the company. It can be used as a standalone SSD in a PC, in a dual-drive setup, or in an SSD RAID configuration – offering performance and flexibility to users. The drive also supports lower-power states, allowing it to operate in devices like laptops and 2-in-1 devices. “The 800P excels with low queue depth random workloads, where most client system activity takes place, and offers uncompromising responsiveness and throughput,” said Intel. The 800P is available in 58GB and 118GB capacities in the M.2 2280 form factor, using an NVMe PCIe 3.0 x2 interface.
