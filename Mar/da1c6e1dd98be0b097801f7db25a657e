SAP Africa has appointed Cathy Smith as its new managing director. Smith brings over 25 years of technology experience to the role. “As one of the foremost experts in driving digital transformation on the continent, Cathy is imminently suited to leading our Africa operations,” said SAP. “We have great confidence in her ability to realise our innovation vision across our customer base.” Smith previously held the post of MD for sub-Saharan Africa at Cisco, before which she spent 23 years at IBM in various leadership roles. Claas Kuehnemann, the previous MD for SAP Africa, has assumed a new leadership role with SAP in Switzerland. “Claas will remain closely allied with SAP Africa as he will continue to be a non-executive director on the SAP South Africa Board,” said SAP.
