Language learning app Duolingo has added a free Klingon course, accessible via the app’s website. Klingon is the fictional language spoken by the Klingon species in Star Trek. The course will be accessible from the Duolingo iOS and Android apps at a later date, said the company. The language learning app also offers a course in High Valyrian, the fictional language from the Game of Thrones TV show. The show is based on George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire novels.
