Telegram has appealed to the European Court of Human Rights to overturn an 800,000 ruble fine (R167,000). The fine was the result of it refusing to provide encryption keys to the Federal Security Service (FSB) in Russia, reported RAPSI. The encryption keys, which Telegram said don’t exist, are meant to allow Russian law enforcement to decrypt the private correspondence of users. The FSB has stated the encryption keys are not considered private information protected by the country’s constitution. Possessing the keys does not violate users’ privacy and any data collected using the keys would still require a court order, said the FSB. RAPSI reported that Telegram’s battle with the Russian government dates back to June 2017, when communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said the messaging app must comply with Russia’s new legislation or face being blocked in the country. Telegram founder Pavel Durov agreed to register the service in Russia, but refused to abide by laws that are “incompatible with Telegram privacy policy.”
