Samsung has set up Galaxy Studios in Johannesburg, Durban, and Cape Town. The venues are open to the public and allow visitors to try out the new Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ smartphones. “The S9 and S9+ mark the new age of smartphone cameras,” said Samsung South Africa’s Craige Fleisher. “We’re really looking forward to seeing how the public responds to what we’ve created in the Galaxy Studio,” he said. Samsung Galaxy Studios are set up at the following locations around the country: “The Galaxy Studio offers visitors the opportunity to immerse themselves in a camera experience like no other – from wind-tunnels to exquisite low-light settings, the encounter is much like an out-of-this-world fun park,” said Samsung. The studios will be open from 1-25 March 2018, within the same hours as the centres in which they are hosted.
