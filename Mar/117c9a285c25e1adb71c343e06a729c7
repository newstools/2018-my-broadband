Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey aims to relaunch verification and make it possible for everyone on the service to get verified. Verification on Twitter was a manual process that resulted in a blue checkmark being displayed next to your name. The process was closed following backlash from users after Twitter verified “white supremacists”. “The intention is to open verification to everyone. And to do it in a way that is scalable,” said Dorsey. Twitter previously said that while it uses the blue checkmark to refer to identity, it was seen by users as an endorsement or a sign of Twitter stating the user is credible. “It was only given to certain very large public figures, celebrities… it came to have a lot of status associated with it, as well,” said Twitter.
