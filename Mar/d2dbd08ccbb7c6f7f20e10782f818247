Netflix has upgraded its parental controls to allow movies and series to be locked using a PIN. “We understand that every family is different and that parents have differing perspectives on what they feel is appropriate,” said Netflix. “While we already provide PIN protection for all content at a particular maturity level for Netflix accounts, PIN protection for a specific series or film provides families with an additional tool.” The service will also display its maturity level ratings for an episode or film after you hit play. “We are also continuing to explore ways to make this information more descriptive and easier for our members to understand with just a quick glance,” said Netflix.
