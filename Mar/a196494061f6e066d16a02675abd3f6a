Spotify is launching in South Africa, according to industry sources. The company has also invited journalists in South Africa to an event on 13 March, stating that “Spotify has some news to share.” This follows speculation that Spotify would launch in South Africa last year. A Senior Editor/Music Programmer job advert for Spotify in South Africa in 2017 also fuelled speculation the service would be available soon. Spotify previously investigated launching in South Africa in 2014, but decided not to proceed. Current industry speculation is that Spotify will not announce a firm launch date next week, but may provide a launch window. Spotify declined to comment on its launch in South Africa. While Spotify leads the subscription streaming music industry, with over 159 million users and 71 million Spotify Premium subscribers across 61 markets, it was beaten to market locally by several providers. These include Apple Music and Google Play Music.
