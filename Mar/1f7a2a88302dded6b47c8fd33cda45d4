Smartphone location data is being sold and traded, often without a user’s knowledge, The Wall Street Journal reported. This means that whenever you authorise an app to access your location, there is a risk that data will be shared with agencies for use in location-aware advertising. According to the report, advertisers want a complete record of where everyone spends their time to break the information down into market segments to sell to advertisers. Research from BIA/Kelsey showed that in 2017, marketers spent $16 billion on location-based ads – which amounts to about 40% of all mobile ad spending. BIA/Kelsey predicted that these types of ads will double by 2021.
