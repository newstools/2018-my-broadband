Transnet unfairly awarded a tender to Vodacom and is now trying to short-circuit a High Court process, MTN told MyBroadband. The statement comes after ICASA issued a notification of a public hearing for a complaint brought against MTN by Transnet. It is alleged that MTN is in breach of ICASA’s number portability regulations. “This dispute relates to a current contract under which MTN provides services to Transnet and also relates to a tender process in which MTN was unfairly disqualified by Transnet,” said MTN spokeswoman Jacqui O’Sullivan. “MTN has taken the Transnet decision to disqualify MTN from the tender on review at the High Court, the original application for which will be heard by the High Court in June 2018.” ICASA will hold its public hearings on the matter on 19 March, however. “MTN has, pending the decision of the High Court in the review application, applied to the High Court for an interdict prohibiting the implementation of the award of the Transnet tender to Vodacom,” said O’Sullivan. She said a response to the Transnet complaint with ICASA has been filed, and argued that the relevant parties must give the court a chance to make a decision. The hearing of the urgent interdict application is on 20 March.
