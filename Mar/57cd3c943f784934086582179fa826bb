Google has renamed Android Wear to “Wear OS by Google”. “We’re now Wear OS by Google, a wearables operating system for everyone,” said Google. The announcement stated that the company’s partnerships have evolved, and that over 30% of Android Wear watch owners in 2017 used an iPhone. “We’re announcing a new name that better reflects our technology,” it said. Wear OS will be used as an operating system on many smartwatches, including devices from Tag Heuer and Fossil. “Wear OS works with phones running Android 4.4+ and iOS 9.3+,” said Google.
