SpecterDev has released a jailbreak of the V4.55 PlayStation 4 firmware, TorrentFreak reported. The code has been posted to Github. “It will allow you to run arbitrary code as kernel, to allow jailbreaking and kernel-level modifications to the system. This release does not contain any code related to defeating anti-piracy mechanisms or running homebrew.” “This exploit does include a loader that listens for payloads on port 9020 and will execute them upon receival,” added the developer. Wololo reported there is a payload called “Holy Grail” that has been circulating privately that fills the remaining gaps of the SpecterDev jailbreak It said Holy Grail lets users install and run unsigned packages, letting users install and run homebrews, as well as pirated games. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
