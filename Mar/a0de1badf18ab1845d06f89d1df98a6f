The DStv Now application is only supported on Google-certified Android TV boxes, meaning viewers who use unofficial Android devices could have issues accessing the app. A MyBroadband reader stated that the DStv Now app no longer works on certain Android media boxes, following a version update. The reader said the new version of the DStv Now app automatically blocks streaming on uncertified devices, which are relatively common in South Africa. Google-certified media boxes available in South Africa include the Telkom LIT, Mi Box, and Nvidia Shield devices. Many users have also posted on the application’s Google Play Store page, complaining that the DStv Now app no longer works with their device. MultiChoice responded to all complaints on its Play Store page by stating that “For legal reasons, the DStv Now app is no longer available on uncertified Google devices”. Many users have reportedly found ways to continue using the DStv Now app on their streaming devices, however, including rolling back their app version and disabling auto-updates. The use of other apps to prevent the block have also reportedly been used. MultiChoice told MyBroadband that it has strict protocols to adhere to and only supports approved devices for its DStv Now application. “We do support Android TV boxes as long as it operates through officially-certified and approved devices,” said MultiChoice. “We have strict security protocols from our content suppliers that we need to adhere to.” “Customers can check whether their device is certified – go to the Play Store and check Device Certification in the settings at the bottom of the screen. If it says Certified, you’ll have no problems loading and using our DStv Now app.”
