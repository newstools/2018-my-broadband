23andMeÂ has received the first FDA authorisation for a direct-to-consumer genetic test for cancer risk. The authorisation allows 23andMe to provide customers with information on three genetic variants known to be associated with a risk for breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer. The variants may also be associated with an increased risk for certain other cancers. These variants are most prevalent in those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and have been observed at much lower rates in other ethnicities. About 1 in 40 individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent has one of these three variants. Women with one of these variants have a 45-85% chance of developing breast cancer by age 70.
