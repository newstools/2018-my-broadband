Atul and Rajesh Gupta each have multiple South African passports, meaning they can travel abroad for years to come. This is according to a report by Rapport, which stated that Home Affairs records show Atul has three valid passports and Rajesh has six. Ajay Gupta’s wife Chetali was sent her third passport three weeks ago – it was shipped to Dubai. The news comes after Ajay fled South Africa following a shift in political power in the country and criminal charges against him looming. The report further stated that on 3 November, when “there were widespread calls for the Guptas to be prosecuted”, the Department of Home Affairs issued two passports to Rajesh. “Both passports were maxi-passports with 48 pages, instead of the ordinary 32 pages,” stated the report. The two passports were also issued on the same day they were applied for, which the Rapport stated was only usually done under special circumstances. According to a report by The Sunday Times, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has initiated a process to revoke the permanent residency of Ajay in South Africa. Gigaba has reportedly requested an investigation into how Ajay obtained residency, and legal advice about withdrawing it.
