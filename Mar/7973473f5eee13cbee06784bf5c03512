Playboy has announced it will allow customers to pay for its adult content using cryptocurrency. The company plans to roll out a dedicated cryptocurrency wallet on its Playboy TV platform this year. The Playboy TV wallet will use the Vice Industry Token (VIT) cryptocurrency, which aims to track user engagement with adult content. “As the popularity of alternative payment methods continues to grow around the world, along with the reach of Playboy’s digital platforms, we felt it was important to give our 100 million monthly consumers increased payment flexibility,” said Playboy. The company said it would consider integrating the cryptocurrency wallet with its other divisions, including gaming and augmented reality.
