Twitter is set to ban a range of cryptocurrency advertising, including initial coin offerings, token sales, and wallets. Sky has reported that Twitter will implement a new advertising policy in two weeks, which prohibits most cryptocurrency advertising. “Twitter may also ban all ads for cryptocurrency exchanges, with some limited exceptions, when the policy is launched,” said Sky. Earlier this month, Twitter implemented measures to halt alleged cryptocurrency-related scams spreading via its platform. Its decision to ban cryptocurrency advertisements follows similar decisions from Google and Facebook. Google will ban online advertisements promoting cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings from June. Facebook took a similar step in January.
