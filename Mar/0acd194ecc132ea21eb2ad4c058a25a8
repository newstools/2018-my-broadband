Mobicel is fast becoming a significant and meaningful player in the mobile communications market due to its commitment to providing quality devices and services at prices that are affordable and accessible to the majority of South Africans. Mobicel has got in touch with its customers and gained an understanding of what they want out of their cellular phones. This is particularly evident in the R series, which includes the R1, R2, R3, R6, and the new R9 Lite and R9 Plus, which was launched in September last year. In this range, Mobicel has focused on providing sufficient onboard memory and storage capable of supporting several apps as well as storing all your photos, videos, and music.  Cameras are high-quality, and screens offer high-definition viewing. The R9 Lite has a 16MP selfie camera, whilst the R9 Plus is the first phone with a dual selfie camera of 20MP and 8MP, allowing for an impressive 120-degree camera angle. Both come with infinity screens and are LTE enabled. The entry level R1 and R2 will set you back just over R1,000 whilst the two top-end phones, the R9 Lite and R9 Plus is priced at R1,999 and R2,999 respectively – substantially more affordable compared to other phones with similar specifications. Mobicel products are also backed by a full technical warranty and after-sale service through its in-house service centre.  The company has embarked on an extensive marketing campaign aimed at elevating awareness of the brand. The Mobisquad allows the public to experience the company’s product offering first-hand through fun promotions where they get to handle and test the various handsets. This underlines the brand’s commitment to bringing the phones of the future to the people of today. For more information, visit the Mobicel website.
