IBM has unveiled the world’s smallest computer at its IBM Think 2018 conference, Mashable reported. The 1mm x 1mm chip is part of the company’s “5 in 5” collection, which showcases technologies it believes will change the world over the next five years. IBM’s tiny computer is smaller than a coarse grain of salt and reportedly costs less than $0.10 to manufacture. The headline image shows an array of 64 computer chips, each with a motherboard. IBM said the chip is built to function as a data source for blockchain applications and could see uses in shipment tracking and basic AI tasks. The company did not announce when the computer would be released.
