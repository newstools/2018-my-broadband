YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki has said the platform will fight the spread of misinformation with information cues. Speaking at the SXSW conference, Wojcicki said while YouTube is not a news organisation, they still want to deliver the right information. “We’re always exploring new ways to battle misinformation on YouTube,” she said. “At SXSW, we announced plans to show additional information cues, including a text box linking to third-party sources around widely-accepted events, like the moon landing.” YouTube said these features will roll out in the coming months, but she cannot share further information about its plans at this stage.
