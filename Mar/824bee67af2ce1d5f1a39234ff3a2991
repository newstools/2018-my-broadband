Mozilla announced it will not spend money on advertising through Facebook for the time being. Mozilla said the news of Facebook user data being collected by Cambridge University professor Aleksandr Kogan caused it to take a closer look at Facebook’s current default privacy settings. “While we believe there is still more to learn, we found that its current default settings leave access open to a lot of data – particularly with respect to settings for third-party apps,” said Mozilla. As a result, it will pause its Facebook advertising. “We are encouraged that Mark Zuckerberg has promised to improve the privacy settings and make them more protective,” it said. “When Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares customer data, specifically strengthening its default privacy settings for third-party apps, we’ll consider returning.”
