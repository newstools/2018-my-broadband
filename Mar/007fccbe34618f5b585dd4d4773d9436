NASA has invited the public to submit their names to be placed on a microchip aboard its Parker Solar Probe. The probe mission will launch this year and will travel through the Sun’s atmosphere to learn more about solar wind and particles surrounding the star. “This probe will journey to a region humanity has never explored before,” said NASA. The spacecraft will be protected by a 4.5-inch thick heat shield during its voyage and will include a memory chip containing the names of anyone who signs up online via the NASA website. Submissions will be accepted until 27 April 2018.
