Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom has won a battle in his fight against being extradited from New Zealand to the US, Reuters reported. A Wellington court ruled that the attorney general broke the law by refusing Dotcom’s request to be given all the information about him held by public agencies. Dotcom argued that the outcome of a case before the Human Rights Review Tribunal may be relevant to his extradition case, and the details he requested could be presented as evidence. The US has requested extradition of Dotcom after the FBI raided his mansion and shut down Megaupload in 2012. Authorities in the US allege that Dotcom cost copyright holders over $175 million by enabling illegal downloads of copyrighted content. Reuters reported that the Human Rights Review Tribunal has already awarded Dotcom damages of R254,000 for “loss of a benefit” and R508,000 for “loss of dignity and injury to feelings”.
