In June 2011, 8ta, now Telkom Mobile, surprised the market when it launched a 10GB mobile data product for R199 per month. At the time, Vodacom and MTN charged R289 for 1GB of data – which shows how disruptive this offer was. 8ta’s Go Big 10GB deal remained unmatched for years. Fortunately, mobile operators are now starting to offer more affordable 10GB data products. Telkom’s Big Deal for March 2018 offers subscribers 10GB of mobile data and a Huawei MiFi Router for R139 per month. MTN, Vodacom, and Cell C are also offering far lower prices on 10GB 24-month contract deals. The table below provides an overview of the best 10GB mobile data deals which are available to South Africans.
