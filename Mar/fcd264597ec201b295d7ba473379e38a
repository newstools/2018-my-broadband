Uber will launch its UberEATS app in 100 new cities, the Financial Times reported. The company plans to launch UberEATS in multiple cities across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa â€“ including Kenya, Ukraine, and Romania. UberEATS currently serves over 200 cities around the world, including locations where the Uber ride-hailing app is not yet operational. The company said the food delivery app is currently profitable in 45 of the 200 markets where it operates, compared to just 3 out of 50 cities reported on last year.
