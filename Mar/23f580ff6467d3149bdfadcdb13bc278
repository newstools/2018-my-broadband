Cell C has announced that for the Easter weekend, its subscribers on Black, or signing up to Black, will be able to stream content or register to the free Black trial without consuming mobile data. “As a holiday treat, we are giving people a chance to experience the content Black has on offer without using data,” said Cell C CEO Jose Dos Santos. All Cell C customers will benefit from the promotion, which runs from midnight on 29 March to midnight on 2 April. Existing customers on Cell C can simply use Black without consuming data, while new subscribers can sign up for a 7-day free trial. Browsing the platform has also been zero rated. Clicking through to the betting platform and the ticketing service, however, will be charged according to the customer’s data plan. National data roaming is not included in this promotion, and Black customers on other cellular networks will not benefit from the free data offer. “The offer is only available on mobile and customers will need to have a positive airtime balance to benefit. While there is no fair usage policy in place, Cell C reserves the right to institute one if we detect high levels of abuse,” said Cell C.
