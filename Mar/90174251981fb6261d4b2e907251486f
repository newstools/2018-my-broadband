Steam has published its Hardware Survey for February 2018, detailing the most popular components used by gamers on the platform. The data shows the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 was the most popular GPU, but does not specify whether the 3GB or 6GB model is more popular. The most common amount of VRAM is 2GB, with 36.12% of Steam gamers using 2GB cards. Intel quad-core processors with a clock speed of between 3.0GHz and 3.29GHz were the most popular chips, with 34.81% of gamers using this class of processor. The Intel Core i3-8100 processor is currently one of the cheapest quad-core desktop chips on the market, and offers a base frequency of 3.6GHz. It should be noted that Intel 8th-gen CPUs are only compatible with 300-series motherboards, of which the more expensive Z370 chipset is currently the only version available in South Africa. Power supplies, motherboards, and cases are not measured by the Steam Hardware Survey, and compatible products were included to provide a pricing overview of a functional PC.
