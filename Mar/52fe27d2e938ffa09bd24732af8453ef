LG has published an open source version of its Linux-based webOS platform. The operating system is currently used in LG’s smart TVs and connected devices, including tablets, set-top boxes and refrigerators. The company plans to increase the global footprint of the operating system by offering a free, open source version of the software to developers. A dedicated website hosts webOS Open Source Edition, along with various tools and guides to aid in the deployment of the platform. “As we move from an app-based environment to a web-based one, we believe the true potential of webOS has yet to be seen,” said LG.
