Physicist Professor Stephen Hawking died on 13 March at the age of 76, a family spokesman said. Hawking is known for his work in the fields of theoretical physics and cosmology, which included ground-breaking models on black holes. He was also an accomplished author, with bestselling books which included A Brief History of Time, Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays, and My Brief History. He was the first academic to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. Hawking suffered from an early-onset, slow-progressing form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – a form of motor neurone disease – that has gradually paralysed him. Doctors expected Hawking to only live for a few years after his diagnoses at 21, but he lived with this condition for over 50 years. In his later years, he was wheelchair bound and communicated using a single cheek muscle attached to a speech-generating device. Hawking was the subject of the Oscar-winning film The Theory of Everything in 2014, which depicted his life at Cambridge University.
