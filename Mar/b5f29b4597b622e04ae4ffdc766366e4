Microsoft has launched its Edge browser for iOS and Android – available as a free download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Microsoft Edge brings multiple features to iOS and Android, including favourites, reading list, new tab page, reading view, and roaming passwords. The browser also features “continue on your PC”, allowing users to open a web page from their phone on their PC. The launch follows the introduction of Edge to the platforms in preview mode last year. Feedback from preview users led Microsoft to add roaming passwords and a dark theme functionality to its browser. Roaming passwords allow users to save a new password on their phone, and it follows them to their PC.
