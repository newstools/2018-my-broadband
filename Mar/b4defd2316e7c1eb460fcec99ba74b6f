Vox has informed customers that it will increase its prices due to the upcoming VAT hike. “The National Treasury announced an increase in VAT from 14% to 15%, effective 1 April 2018. There will, therefore, be an adjustment to your fees as our services are subject to VAT,” said Vox. Vox’s price hike statement follows several tech players announcing similar moves. Telkom, Cell C, Vodacom, and MTN have all announced they are hiking their prices due to the VAT increase. Hetzner is not hiking prices, however, and its hosting fees will not go up next month.
