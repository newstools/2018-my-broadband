The Sunday Times has revealed that the SABC has spent R740,000 on an Audi Q5 for former board chairman Mbulaheni Maguvhe. This car was bought at a time when the state broadcaster was in serious financial trouble and is now gathering dust in an SABC parking lot in Auckland Park. Maguvhe resigned as SABC board chairman in December 2016, following a parliamentary inquiry looking into the board’s fitness to hold office. He was the last SABC board member who was investigated as part of the inquiry to resign, despite being unable to account for controversial developments at the public broadcaster. His resignation was widely welcomed by political parties, but they highlighted that they still wanted him to be held accountable for the crisis at the SABC. ANC Chief whip in Parliament Jackson Mthembu described Maghuve as a stumbling block to resolving the cooperate governance at SABC. “It is unfortunate that Prof Maguvhe chose to sacrifice his personal reputation and professional integrity by putting his selfish personal interests ahead of those of South Africans, who are the shareholders of the SABC,” Mthembu said in a statement. A report by parliament’s legal services in 2017 accused Maguvhe of trying to mislead the inquiry over the labour dispute between the SABC 8 and the SABC.
