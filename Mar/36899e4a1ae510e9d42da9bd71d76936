The South African Post Office’s online presence appears to be in tatters. Accessing the SA Post Office website is impossible, and navigating to www.postoffice.co.za results in a “server IP address could not be found” error. Emails to addresses on the postoffice.co.za domain are also bouncing, and producing a “mail delivery failed” error. Emails sent to SA Post Office staff saw us receive the following error: Final-Recipient: rfc822;[Address redacted]@postoffice.co.za
Status: 5.0.0
Diagnostic-Code: smtp; Unrouteable address The website and email downtime follows recent reports that the Post Office website was down for several days. Customers also previously reported that calls to the company’s call centre were not answered. Additionally, MyBroadband found that payment for the postoffice.co.za domain has not been made, according to the ZACR whois service. An amount of R125.40 was invoiced on 1 February 2018, and was listed as “not paid” at the time of writing. The invoice was sent to domainmaster@postoffice.co.za. Further signs of trouble were found when the telephone numbers listed on the whois page for the “Admin” and “IT Support” at the Post Office were called. Both numbers returned an automated message that they had been changed, and that the new numbers were not available. As stated above, attempts by MyBroadband to contact the Post Office via email and telephone proved futile.
