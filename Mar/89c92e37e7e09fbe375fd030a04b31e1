WhatsApp has signed an undertaking not to share user data with Facebook until it can do so in compliance with United Kingdom regulations, TechCrunch reported. The Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK said it had closed its investigation into how WhatsApp and Facebook share data, and that it will not fine Facebook. This comes after Facebook changed its privacy policy to allow it to connect your phone number from WhatsApp to Facebook’s systems. Facebook’s announcement was met with criticism from subscribers who saw the move as a betrayal. The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office summarised their investigation here.
