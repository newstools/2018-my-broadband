MTN recently launched its 100% Bonus Starter Pack, which offers users double their recharge amount. When a users recharges with airtime, they receive 100% bonus airtime. “The SIM card doubles the value each time you recharge, allowing MTN to further brighten South Africans’ lives,” said MTN. The MTN 100% Bonus Starter Pack contains a few key elements users should be aware of, however. The offer is only available to new customers, and has been provisioned to all SIM cards currently in the market. This means when a customer purchases a SIM starter pack, they will be provisioned with the new offer, said MTN. Customers must buy a new SIM to access the offer, it reiterated. “Existing customers moving into the MTN Base price plan will not receive the 100% giveback promotion,” said MTN. The bonus airtime which users receive also expires at 23:59 on the day of the recharge. The bonus airtime cannot be used to purchase voice and data bundles, or for international calling. MTN added that the 100% Bonus promotion will not last indefinitely for each customer, and expires six months after their SIM card has been activated.
