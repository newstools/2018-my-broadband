Makro has launched HAIG CLUB Clubman single grain scotch whisky as a new addition to their liquor range – available for R279 per single 750ml unit. The House of HAIG recently introduced the HAIG CLUB Clubman, which inherits the same bold and progressive spirit as HAIG CLUB Icon – designed to be different, stylish, and modern whilst incorporating nearly 400 years of House of Haig heritage. The newly introduced scotch whisky is matured exclusively in American ex-bourbon casks, allowing the sweet, gentle, single grain scotch whisky from Cameron bridge to interact with the vanilla, butterscotch, and sweet toffee flavours found in the ex-bourbon casks. The result is a wonderfully smooth, sweet, and enjoyable whisky. Haig Club Clubman is delicious straight-up or on the rocks, but it is also perfectly enjoyed with cola or other soft-drinks. The sweet, vanilla, and coconut flavours combine with the sweet caramel of cola, creating an approachable and delicious drink, which is refreshing in taste and perfect in its simplicity. HAIG CLUB Clubman is available at Makro stores nationwide as well as on the Makro online store. A single 750ml unit is priced at R279, while a case of six is available for R1,671. Makro only sells liquor products to customers over 18 years, and buyers will be required to enter either an ID number or a valid liquor licence when concluding their purchase.
