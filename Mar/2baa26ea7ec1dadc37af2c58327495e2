SAP SE said a probe into its dealings with South Africa’s Guptas found that the German software giant paid about 128.6 million rand ($10.7 million) to businesses linked to the family to win contracts with state-owned companies. Three senior executives who were suspended last year have now quit, the Walldorf-based company said in a statement Thursday. SAP has strengthened its legal and compliance teams and is co-operating with ongoing investigations by U.S. and South African authorities. Details of the payments to Gupta-related third-parties come after SAP said last year it was being probed by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over how it won contracts with South African state businesses Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. and Transnet SOC Ltd. It’s one of several international companies to have become involved in corruption allegations surrounding the Guptas, including McKinsey & Co Inc. and KPMG LLP. The Guptas, who are friends with former President Jacob Zuma and in business with one of his sons, are accused of using their political connections to win state contracts and influence ministerial appointments. They and the Zumas deny wrongdoing.
