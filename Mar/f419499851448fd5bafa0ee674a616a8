Fortinet, a global leader in broad, integrated, and automated cybersecurity solutions, has announced the category winners of its 2017 Southern African Development Community (SADC) Regional Partners of the Year. Fortinet partners with the most innovative, industry-leading companies to ensure that their customers are connected to the expertise, services, and technologies they need. The awards programme is aimed at recognising and celebrating the accomplishments of Fortinet’s growing partner community in the region. Paul Williams, Country Manager – Southern Africa at Fortinet, congratulated the winning partners, noting that Fortinet valued its channel and believed that formal recognition supported partner growth. “We are a 100% channel company, so we believe it is important to recognise and validate what our partners do to grow the business across SADC,” he said. The awards are based on multiple criteria that includes revenue contribution and organic growth – main awards are conferred to partners with the best revenue proceeds throughout the year who then receive the Revenue, Gold, and Silver partner awards for this achievement. “Dimension Data received the highest award for contributing $1 million, while Executive solutions received the award for Silver partner as they brought in $400,000 for us. Executive Solutions also grew from last year and achieved this award, as we also judge organic growth year-on-year, which is very important to us,” added Williams. Other awards are based on partner performance within their businesses and how they change their business to work with Fortinet technology. “Many of the winners in this category took their business and turned it around. They took the necessary steps to find out how to become a Fortinet partner, and after they have become a partner they have shown Fortinet great value,” said Williams. As an incentive for partners to work towards achieving preset goals, Fortinet runs programmes in certain technology areas and promotes certain products to the rankings through the partners as well. According to Williams, Fortinet Southern Africa has seen growth in its partner network, as well as evolution in the partner business models in recent years. Some have changed focus to become niche Fortinet specialists, and several have enhanced their offerings to become managed service providers as interest in Fortinet solutions grows across SADC. “We’re seeing partners moving up to gold and platinum level faster than in the past, as well as partners looking at how they can develop and change their businesses to adapt to Fortinet solutions,” he said. “Their efforts, as well as feedback from our partners across the region, indicated it was time for us to enhance our channel engagements, formally recognise achievements, and support competition between partners.” The winners of the 2017 Southern African Development Community (SADC) Regional Partners of the Year are listed below.
