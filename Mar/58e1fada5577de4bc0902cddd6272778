Telkom is migrating customers in selected areas to newer technologies, partly due to regulatory issues. This information followed a meeting with civil rights organisation AfriForum, which complained about the discontinuing of services in certain rural areas. According to AfriForum, Telkom cut off landlines in the rural areas of the Western, Northern, and Eastern Cape – without making alternative options available. Telkom confirmed there is a programme to migrate Telkom customers in certain areas to newer technology for a number of reasons. This includes a requirement by ICASA for the return of spectrum (2.4kHz TDMA) to the regulator by no later than 31 March 2018. Telkom used this spectrum to provide services in select rural areas, and the return of the spectrum will therefore affect these customers. The company said the migration process has affected approximately 14,000 customers across the country. “Customers have been contacted in various forms, including a message on the affected customer’s line to inform them of the requirement to migrate to an alternative service,” said Telkom. Telkom customers have been offered alternative technologies that allow them to keep their telephone number at a similar price to their previous rental agreement, it added.
