Almost 24 hours after Standard Bank announced it was “experiencing technical difficulties”, clients can still not use all of its services. At 10:04 on 28 February, Standard Bank tweeted that it was “experiencing technical difficulties on self-service channels”. “We apologise for the inconvenience and are working hard to resolve the matter,” it said. At 08:25 this morning, however, the bank tweeted that it was still experiencing “intermittent services on the Mobile Banking App”. According to users and tests performed by MyBroadband, this is not the only banking element that was not working. A test by MyBroadband revealed that Standard Bank’s Internet banking via a web browser was not working as it should. Simple tasks like transferring money between a client’s account could not be processed, with the banking profile producing “technical exception” errors. Standard Bank was asked about the cause of the service disruptions and when all its systems would be online, but the bank replied with its generic statement previously posted to Twitter. We are experiencing intermittent services on the Mobile Banking App. Our technical teams are working tirelessly to resolve the issues. We confirm that the following channels are available to our customers: ATMs, Internet banking, branch and call centre services. You can contact the call center on 0860 123 000 or visit your nearest branch for urgent queries. We apologise for the inconvenience and are working to resolve the matter.
