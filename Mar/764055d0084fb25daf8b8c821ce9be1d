A new study based in the United States found that Android users have higher brand loyalty than their iOS counterparts. As reported by TechCrunch, the Consumer Intelligence Research Partners study said Android loyalty has been rising since 2016 and is currently the highest it has ever been. Android loyalty at the end of 2017 was 91%, with iOS brand loyalty ending the year at 86%. The research found that most users choose an operating system, learn how to use it, and stay with it. In 2014, iOS users had higher brand loyalty than Android users, although Android overtook iOS by the end of that year. The research firm noted that Android has a larger user base than iOS, and the absolute number of users who switch to iOS from Android is at least as large as the number that switch from Android to iOS.
