MultiChoice recently announced its annual DStv price adjustments. Subscribers have two options when it comes to avoiding the price increase. The first is to make an annual payment, and receive a month’s free DStv. The second is to sign up for a Price Lock offer that will fix your fees at their current level for the next 24 months. Price Lock is only available for DStv Premium or Compact, and requires a debit order to be authorised. The bundles include an Explora 2 decoder, your monthly subscription, and the PVR and XtraView fees. To see how much you will save, however, we conducted a price comparison. The comparison assumes that you want a DStv Explora 2 decoder, and PVR or XtraView services. It also includes installation for the Premium package with Wi-Fi Connector, and Compact deals. It further assumes that you would be able to buy an Explora 2 outright for R999, or for R1,699 including installation. MultiChoice’s repayment plans for the DStv Explora 2 work out to be much more expensive than the retail pricing. Crucially, the comparison also assumes you take up a Price Lock offer before the start of April.
