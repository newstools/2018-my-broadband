Uber riders in South Africa who want to reward good service can now tip their drivers. At the end of a trip, you will be able to issue a tip from a range of options, or a customisable amount. These options will be made available below the rating and compliments section, and will remain optional. Payments will be deducted from the riderâ€™s credit card. Cash-paying customers are free to tip an additional amount of their choice. This feature will also be available when ordering food from UberEATS, said the company. Not all Uber drivers will receive this option, however, as the company requires drivers to opt-in before being able to accept tips.
