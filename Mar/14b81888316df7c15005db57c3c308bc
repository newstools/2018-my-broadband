Epic Games has announced that Fortnite Battle Royale is coming to smartphones and tablets. The company said iPad and iPhone owners will be able to sign up for an iOS Invite Event from 12 March 2018, with support for Android coming later this year. The mobile version of the game will be identical to the desktop and console versions, and the game will support cross-play between PlayStation 4, PC, Mac, iOS, and Android. “We believe this is the future of games,” said Epic Games. “The same game on all platforms. Console quality graphics and action. Play when you want, where you want.” Players who sign up for the iOS Invite Event on the Fortnite website will receive invitations to download the game from the App Store. To download Fortnite on iOS, users will need iOS 11 installed on at least an iPhone 6S/SE, iPad Mini 4, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, or iPad 2017.
