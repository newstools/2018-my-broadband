The operator of Sharebeast.com, Newjams.net, and Albumjams.com has been sentenced to five years in prison, Sophos reported. Artur Sargsyan, a 30 year-old man, pleaded guilty to one felony count of criminal copyright infringement related to Sharebeast. According to the US Department of Justice, the site facilitated unauthorised distribution and reproduction of over one billion copies of copyrighted works. The department said that Sargsyan pirated thousands of songs that had not yet been officially released. Law enforcement shut down his sites in August 2015, with police in the UK and the Netherlands helping the FBI to seize the servers he was using. While the RIAA estimated the damages to its member companies was around $6.3 billion, the court ordered a significantly smaller amount in restitution and forfeiture. Sargsyan was ordered to pay restitution of $458,200 and ordered to forfeit $184,768. Sophos concluded that much of that money may have come from the pop-up ads on his sites.
