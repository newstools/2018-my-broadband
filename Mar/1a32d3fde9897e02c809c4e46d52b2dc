Local fibre ISP SAFibre has sent a letter to its clients detailing a dispute with TT Connect over a “material breach in contract”. SAFibre said it went into dispute resolution meetings with TT Connect – which builds last-mile fibre networks – in December 2017, following “support issues” and problems with general service levels. “TT Connect eventually told us the issues were resolved, where the same issues were still occuring,” said SAFibre. SAFibre then brought an urgent application to the Pretoria High Court in February regarding what it said was a breach in contract by TT Connect. “TT Connect proceeded to start settlement meetings after being informed of [the] pending case, which resulted in discussing a buyout of SAFibre in an effort for them to absolve responsibility.” The meetings failed, however, and SAFibre continued with the legal proceedings, it said. “Upon TT Connect receiving our case from the sheriff on 5 March, we received a letter for the termination of our account for 9 March, requesting an exorbitant surety amount specifically before the case and our interdict is heard,” said SAFibre. “We have requested TT Connect to take over client lines until the matter has been dealt with in court,” it said. “SAFibre would like to apologise, as we have been attempting to resolve this without any impact to our clients.” It said it is making alternative arrangements with another ISP should services be cut, to alleviate any downtime.
