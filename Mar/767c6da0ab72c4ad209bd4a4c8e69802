Uberâ€™s self-driving trucks are working for customers via Uber Freight, TechCrunch reported. The autonomous vehicles function in conjunction with human drivers, taking on long-haul freight transport assignments, while human drivers handle shorter transfers. Human drivers are spared long-haul trips and instead move freight between shippers and transfer hubs, where the payload is offloaded to a self-driving truck. Uber has deployed its self-driving vehicles on the Uber Freight platform in the United States.
