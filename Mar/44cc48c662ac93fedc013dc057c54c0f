A study by Japanese scientists has shown that minimal exposure to light at night increases depression risk. The research assessed bedroom light intensity and depressive symptoms using 863 participants between 2010 and 2014 in Nara, Japan. Of 863 participants who did not have depressive symptoms at baseline, 73 participants reported development of depressive symptoms during a follow-up. Compared with the “dark” group, the group which was exposed to minimal light at night exhibited a significantly higher depression risk. “These results indicated that exposure to light at night in home settings was independently associated with subsequent depression risk in an elderly general population,” said the researchers.
