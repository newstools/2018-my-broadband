Walmart is looking to blockchain technology to create an improved delivery system. The smart package system is defined in a patent application filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office. The package would include a device that records information regarding its contents on a blockchain. The device would measure the state of the package contents, environmental factors, location data, and more. According to the application, the blockchain is “hashed with key addresses along the chain of custody, including hashing with a seller private key address, a courier private key address, and a buyer private key address”.
