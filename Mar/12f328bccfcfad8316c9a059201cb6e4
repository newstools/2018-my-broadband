Bugatti has unveiled its latest hypercar, the Chiron Sport. The Chiron Sport features the same 16-cylinder, 4-turbo engine from the Chiron, which produces over 1,000kW and takes the car from 0-100km/h in under 2.5 seconds. The Chiron Sport was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show this week, with Bugatti stating the new model features “significantly improved handling and even greater agility”. Stiffer suspension, a dynamic torque vectoring function, a weight reduction of 18kg, and carbon fibre windscreen wipers are more improvements over the standard Chiron. “Bugatti has developed the Chiron Sport for customers wanting an even sportier driving experience with their Chiron, with improved lateral dynamics on winding roads.” The base price of the car is $3.26 million and first deliveries are expected before the end of 2018.
