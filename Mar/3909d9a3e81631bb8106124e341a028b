MyBroadband has launched an IT Jobs portal, making it easy for companies to recruit IT professionals. MyBroadband is South Africa’s largest IT publication, with over 2 million unique browsers and 8 million page views every month. The latest readership statistics show that most of these readers are IT executives and IT professionals who work in the IT, telecoms, and finance fields. MyBroadband is therefore the best choice to attract the best IT talent in South Africa, which is why we launched the IT Jobs website. In addition to its dedicated IT jobs portal, the IT jobs will appear on MyBroadband’s home page, in the MyBroadband forum, and in the MyBroadband daily newsletter – which is sent to around 150,000 subscribers.
