MultiChoice said it has received registrations of interest from over 60 parties for a new, black-owned channel on DStv. The announcement comes after DStv dropped ANN7, admitting it “made mistakes” taking the channel onboard. MultiChoice is now looking to replace ANN7 with another local news channel. “We’re delighted and overwhelmed with the response, and we’re encouraged that we’ll be able to offer South Africans another local news channel,” said Calvo Mawela, CEO for MultiChoice South Africa. MultiChoice has opened the tender process for the channel, which closes on 30 April 2018. The successful bidder will be notified before 31 July 2018.
