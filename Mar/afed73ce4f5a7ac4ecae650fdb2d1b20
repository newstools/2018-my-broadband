The Mercedes-Benz X-Class has received South African pricing. According to Wheels24, the bakkie will sell locally for the following prices from 1 April: The report stated that the pricing of the X250d Progressive and Power 4×4 automatic models will be revealed in the future. It also stated that the high-end V6 X-Class will arrive in South Africa later in 2018. “The X-Class shifts the limits of the classic bakkie world. Yet still remains true to it. Because although it breaks fresh ground as an urban lifestyle and family vehicle, the X-Class essentially remains a robust, functional bakkie with off-road capability, and is up to practically any challenge,” said Mercedes-Benz.
