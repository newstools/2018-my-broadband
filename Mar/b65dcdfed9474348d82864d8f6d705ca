Google’s head of security for Android David Kleidermacher said Android is just as secure as iOS, CNET reported. Kleidermacher said the Android team is working to reduce the number of security bugs within Android, and said the operating system “is now as safe as the competition”. He said their security software improved drastically in 2017, and now protects users from malicious software far more effectively. Google recently published its Android Security 2017 Year in Review report, detailing the advancements made in Android security. “Android security made a significant leap forward in 2017 and many of our protections now lead the industry,” it stated.
