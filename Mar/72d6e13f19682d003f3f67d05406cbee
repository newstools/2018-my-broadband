MyBroadband’s February 2018 Speed Test App results show that Cool Ideas’ subscribers enjoy the highest average Wi-Fi speeds, followed by Vodacom Business and Cipherwave. MyBroadband’s free Speed Test App for Android and iOS gives smartphone users the ability to test their mobile and Wi-Fi connection speeds. The Speed Test App is ad-free and allows users to test the download speed, upload speed, and latency of their Internet connection. The MyBroadband Speed Test App has been installed by over 20,000 users, who conduct thousands of tests each month. Last month, 59,000 speed tests were performed over Wi-Fi – which provides an excellent overview of the average local broadband speed. According to the stats, the average download speed over Wi-Fi in South Africa was 9.3Mbps. The average upload speed was 5.4Mbps. The table below details the average Wi-Fi speed per Internet service provider, ranked according to download speed. These speeds are closely linked to the average broadband speeds, as most Wi-Fi connections are linked to a fixed-broadband connection. It should be noted that the ISPs have different user profiles, which affects the average connection speed of their subscribers. An ISP with predominantly fibre subscribers, for example, will easily outperform an ISP with mainly ADSL subscribers. Only prominent ISPs with a high number of Wi-Fi tests using the MyBroadband Speed Test App were listed.
