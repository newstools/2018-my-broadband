Former president Jacob Zuma allegedly received a cash bribe of R1 million from an abalone dealer to keep a minister in his job. The City Press reported that Zuma is being investigated by the Hawks for accepting the bribe to keep Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana in his cabinet. The people behind the bribe wanted Zokwana to stay in his job, as they would benefit from his transformation agenda. This comes after businessman Chaile Seretse deposed an affidavit to this effect at the Lyttelton Police Station in Centurion in December. He also alleges that the businessman paid R300,000 each to Zokwana, Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini, and agriculture department deputy director-general Siphokazi Ndudane. The Hawks were investigating the bribery claims against Zuma, Zokwana, Dlamini, and Ndudane, said spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi. Earlier this month, the National Prosecuting Authority said it’s pursuing 16 charges against Zuma. These charges were shelved nine years ago amid allegations of political interference. The announcement compounded Zuma’s fall from power, after he was forced to step down as president to be replaced by Cyril Ramaphosa. The NPA spent eight years investigating allegations that Zuma took R4 million in bribes from arms dealers. The state attorney has also revealed that the Presidency has spent R15.3 million on Zuma’s legal battles. This includes all legal fees relating to the National Prosecuting Authority’s decision to decline to prosecute Zuma. According to the DA, Zuma should be personally responsible for the fees. The DA said it would approach the court to set aside the decision to allow taxpayers’ money to be used to pay Zuma’s legal fees. Ramaphosa said he will study the merits of the DA’s court challenge.
