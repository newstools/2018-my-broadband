Cloudflare has released its Mobile SDK, which allows developers to monitor network performance and identify problems. The Mobile SDK tracks network performance data from users across multiple countries. The tool also features a Metrics Mode dashboard, which developers can use to identify which carriers, networks, and APIs are not performing well. The Cloudflare Mobile SDK is free to developers and the network performance tracker can be implemented into compatible Android and iOS apps. “Using Mobile NX Metrics, you can identify top N requests, slow requests, and requests most likely to fail,” said Cloudflare.
