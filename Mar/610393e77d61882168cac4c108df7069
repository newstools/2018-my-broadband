Warner Bros has opened pre-registrations for its upcoming Westworld mobile game. Gamers can pre-register for the game on itsÂ website, which will grant them exclusive rewards when the game launches on iOS and Android. Westworld will launch for mobile in April 2018 and will allow players to control their own version of an AI-populated theme park. Pre-registered players can only claim rewards by downloading the game before 10 May 2018. Warner Bros is working with the producers of the Westworld TV show to bring the depth of the series to the game.
