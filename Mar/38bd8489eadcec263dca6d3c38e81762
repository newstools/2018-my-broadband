Facebook is expanding its breaking news label trial to over 50 publishers. The expanded trial builds on a test in the US, which enabled a group of publishers to identify and label breaking news. Publishers in the test will be able to label Instant Articles, mobile and web links, and Facebook Live as breaking news. The publishers can use the indicator once a day, setting how long the story is marked as “breaking” (up to 6 hours). The posts will appear in News Feed and there will be linked information in Page Insights. Readers will also be able to provide feedback when they don’t consider a story to be breaking news. Facebook said it will track the feedback from users, and if the trial is successful, it may add more publishers to the test.
