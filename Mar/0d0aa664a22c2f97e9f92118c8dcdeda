Mini has unveiled an all-electric version of the classic Mini. This demonstrates its appetite for electric driving and embracing zero-emission technology, said Mini. The Mini Electric Concept was announced at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show, and paved the way for the brand’s first all-electric vehicle – which will be launched in 2019. The electric vehicle is currently in development, based on the Mini 3 Door, and will be produced at the Mini Plant Oxford. The company said the classic Mini Electric will remain unique, where a restored example of the classic Mini Cooper will serve as the basis for the vehicle.
