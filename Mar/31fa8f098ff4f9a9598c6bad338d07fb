Facebook has confirmed that it logged users’ call and text history on Messenger and Facebook Lite on Android. The company has disputed reports that it gathered this information without users’ permission, however. Facebook said it only collected call and SMS information as part of an opt-in feature of Messenger or Facebook Lite. “People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If they no longer wish to use this feature, they can turn it off in settings,” said Facebook. When the feature is switched off, previously-shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. The company said it introduced this feature in Messenger in 2015, and later incorporated it as an option in Facebook Lite. “Contact importers are fairly common among social apps and services as a way to more easily find the people you want to connect with.” The company said the feature does not collect the content of users’ calls or text messages, and the information is securely stored.
