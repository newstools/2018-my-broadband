Nimbus Data has launched the ExaDrive DC100, a 100TB SSD. Featuring over three-times the capacity of its closest competitor, the ExaDrive DC100 also draws 85% less power per terabyte. Nimbus Data is confident the drive can help accelerate flash memory adoption in both cloud infrastructure and edge computing, it said. For data centres, a single rack of DC100 SSDs can achieve over 100 petabytes of capacity. Data centres can also reduce power, cooling, and rack space costs by 85% per terabyte, enabling more workloads to move to flash. The DC100 achieves up to 100,000 IOPS (read or write) and up to 500MBps throughput. It is also protected by an unlimited endurance guarantee of five years, with 100TB and 50TB models available later in 2018.
