MultiChoice has confirmed that GlowTV will stop airing on DStv. “GlowTV’s contract will come to an end in March and they will stop airing on DStv at the end of March 2018,” it told MyBroadband. A media statement by the Nismedia Group, which owns the rights to GlowTV, said it had launched an application against DStv in the Johannesburg High Court over the channel arrangement. The company was advised that until the outcome of the legal process was announced, DStv was compelled to keep GlowTV on air. MultiChoice confirmed it will stop broadcasting the channel at the end of the month, however. GlowTV features a selection of Eastern-inspired content, sourced from around the world. The Nismedia Group said viewers were “outraged” over DStv’s decision to stop airing the channel. “I have always seen great potential in GlowTV and the need for Eastern-inspired content in Southern Africa,” said Nismedia CEO Nazeer Noormohamed. “We have received an influx of support from our loyal viewers regarding this matter.”
