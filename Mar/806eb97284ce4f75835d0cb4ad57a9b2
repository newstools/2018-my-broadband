MTN will adjust its prices inline with the Treasury’s increase in VAT from 14% to 15% on 1 April 2018. It joins Vodacom in informing customers that its prices will increase next month. “We will communicate the detail of the change directly, to all our customers, before changes are implemented.” Former finance minister Malusi Gigaba announced the change to VAT on 21 Feburary as part of his budget speech. Gigaba said South Africa had not adjusted VAT since 1993, and that it was low compared to the country’s peers.
