Facebook has ended a test in six countries where it split its news feed between photos and updates from friends, and the “explore feed” which contained updates from pages users had liked. Reuters reported the test was conducted from October 2017, and that it affected website traffic for small media outlets. According to the report, Facebook decided against the two-stream system and reverted to using one feed. “People told us they were less satisfied with the posts they were seeing, and having two separate feeds didn’t actually help them connect more with friends,” said Facebook. Subscribers also told Facebook the change made it more difficult for people to access important information, and that the company didn’t communicate the test clearly. Facebook said it would revise how it tests product changes.
