Steam has updated its performance statistics for the most popular Internet service providers connecting to its platform. South Africans downloaded 439.9TB from Steam at an average rate of 4.4Mbps last week, said the company. This accounted for 0.2% of the total traffic downloaded from the platform during the period. SteamSpy also reported that over the past two weeks, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was the Steam game with the highest number of players in South Africa. The table below ranks the most popular ISPs in South Africa accessing Steam, based on the number of bytes delivered to that network from Steam.
