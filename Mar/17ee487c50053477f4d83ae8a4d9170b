Hetzner has announced that its hosting fees will not be affected by the increase in VAT on 1 April 2018. “After weighing up this important issue, Hetzner has decided to absorb the increase in VAT and not pass it onto our customers,” it said. “We don’t believe that the VAT increase is an adequate trigger for a price increase. There are a number of factors we do take into consideration when reviewing our pricing.” Hetzner said it is always looking for the perfect price-to-performance ratio and regularly reviews its pricing against various factors. “As global input costs continue to increase, we may not be able to avoid price adjustments indefinitely. But we prefer to look at price increases tied to improvements in our service,” said Hetzner. “If an adjustment is required in the future, we will carefully consider the value we offer our customers.”
