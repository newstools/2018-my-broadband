University of the Free State students are protesting over a revised tariff plan for Internet access, TimesLive reported. The university has reportedly reduced the monthly Internet allowance for students from 5.5GB to 800MB. The Student Representative Council previously spoke out against the revised Internet tariffs and rejected them as “exploitation”. The SRC demanded that the university change the new data allocations and how much students are charged for Internet access. “We cannot accept the new tariffs on multiple reasons‚ a fundamental one being that ours as the SRC is ensuring that the university provides unlimited access to Internet for our students in line with standard practice with other institutions of higher learning,” said the SRC. Videos of the protest have been published on Twitter.
