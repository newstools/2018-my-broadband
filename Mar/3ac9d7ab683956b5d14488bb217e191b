Facebook has expanded its jobs portal to over 40 countries. The feature allows companies to post jobs on the platform, letting people apply on Facebook. “In an online poll of 5,000 adults conducted by Morning Consult, one in four people in the US said they searched for or found a job using Facebook,” it said. “Since introducing job postings on Facebook in the US and Canada last year, we’ve built new features for businesses – like the ability to create job posts on mobile, manage applications, and schedule interviews.” Facebook said it believes there is still more it can do to connect people and businesses.
