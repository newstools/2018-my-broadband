The Seoul Metropolitan Government in South Korea will introduce an initiative to force employees to leave work on time, the BBC reported. According to the government, it is trying to stop a culture of working overtime. The report stated that government employees in South Korea work an average of 2,739 hours a year, which is about 1,000 hours more than workers in other developed countries. Seoul’s shutdown initiative will roll out in phases over the next three months. Phase one will power down office computers at 20:00 on Fridays. Phase two starts in April, and employees will have their computers turned off at 19:30 on the second and fourth Friday of the month. In phase three in May, computers will be shut off at 19:00 every Friday. Exemptions may be provided, with 67.1% of government workers asking to be exempt.
