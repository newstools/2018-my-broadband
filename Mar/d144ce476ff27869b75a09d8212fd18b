SqwidNet has announced that it now covers 83% of the South African population with its network. “With over 90% and 75% coverage across municipal and national highways respectively, it has become the fastest-growing IoT network in South Africa,” said the company. SqwidNet said it has also partnered with over 30 ICT service providers which are deploying IoT solutions. Reshaad Sha, CEO of SqwidNet, said IoT and digital transformation solutions their customers are adopting can result in tangible benefits – either through cost savings or revenue enhancement. “Customer demand for the type of connectivity and associated devices that we enable has been unprecedented. This demand comes from a wide variety of industry verticals and this in turn has triggered further development in the IoT ecosystem that we participate in,” said Sha. SqwidNet is backed by its global partner Sigfox, which has established a network presence that now reaches 45 countries, covering 803 million people.
