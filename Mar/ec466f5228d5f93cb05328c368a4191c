Lenovo recently held a press event in Johannesburg where it outlined its plans for the recently-launched Legion and Yoga notebook lineups. The Legion name is attached to Lenovo’s gaming laptops, which all currently feature Intel 7th-generation processors and discrete Nvidia graphics cards. Lenovo’s mainstream Yoga lineup also sports 7th-generation Intel CPUs, with the exception of the Yoga 920 – which has an Intel Core i7 8th-generation chip. The company said it plans to upgrade its device lineup throughout 2018, which includes a refresh of the Yoga and Legion ranges. The Legion notebook lineup consist of the Y520, Y720, Y920 models, while the Yoga range consists of the 520, 720, 920 models. Lenovo said its Legion and Yoga notebooks will all be upgraded to Intel 8th-generation processors by July 2018. Intel’s 8th-gen chips boast increased performance and core counts compared to the previous generation, meaning these refreshed laptops will be notably more powerful than the currently models. Following the CPU refresh, the pricing of the laptops will be revisited and could change, depending the rand-dollar exchange rate, said Lenovo. The company said it would also launch notebooks with AMD Ryzen processors later this year, some of which may include integrated Radeon Vega graphics.
