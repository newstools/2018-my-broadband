GoPro has unveiled its latest action camera – the Hero. Unlike its previous cameras, there is no number or word attached to the Hero – it is just called the GoPro Hero. The action camera has a recommended retail price of $199, making it substantially cheaper than its siblings: the $299 Hero5, and the $399 Hero6. GoPro has positioned the Hero as an action camera you can take anywhere and which captures footage which would be “difficult to take with a smartphone”. “Hero is a great first GoPro for people looking to share experiences beyond what a phone can capture,” said the company, targeting those new to the action camera market. The Hero features many of the capabilities which made GoPro’s cameras famous, including: When it comes to video recording, as stated above, users can choose between 1440p (1,920 x 1,440) and 1080p (1,920 x 1,080). No resolutions higher or lower than this are available, according to the camera’s specification sheet. The frame rate options available include 30fps and 60fps for both resolutions, while the field of view options available are: wide, medium, and narrow. The aspect ratio for all the video settings above is 16:9. GoPro added that the 10MP photo capture on the Hero produces wide field of view images with a resolution of 3,648 x 2,736. The Hero also packs Wi-Fi connectivity, which supports 2.4GHz and 5GHz connections, stated the company.  <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
