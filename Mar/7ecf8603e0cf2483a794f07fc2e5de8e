The Department of Telecommunications aims to assign high-demand spectrum by March 2019, it told MyBroadband. That is, if everything goes to plan, said the department. In other words, if the Electronic Communications Act Amendment Bill is passed. “The [ECA Amendment] Bill is the biggest potential block to the process,” it said. The announcement comes after the Department of Communications said the migration from analogue to digital TV broadcasting must be finalised by June 2019. The digital migration will result in the availability of the “digital dividend” – frequency spectrum which is suited to rolling out wide coverage of 4G services. “Our view is that the process has dragged on for too long, and it’s time to resolve it.”
