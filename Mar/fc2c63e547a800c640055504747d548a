Following the unveiling of the Mercedes-Benz X-Class in South Africa, bakkie enthusiasts soon began arguing about the new vehicle. The discussion touched on the capabilities of the X-Class, its off-road clout, and whether it would trump the likes of the Toyota Hilux and Ford Ranger. The centre point for most discussions, however, was the price of the X-Class in South Africa. Two points were raised by drivers: With the Mercedes-Benz X-Class starting at R642,000 for a X220d 4×2 model and going up to R818,000 for a X250d 4X4 model, it is more expensive than competing bakkies on the market. The company is also yet to announce pricing for its top-of-the-range V6 X-Class model. To see how the X-Class stacks up against competing double-cab bakkies from Toyota, VW, Ford, and Nissan, we looked at what consumers can buy for the price of an X-Class. The table below details the price, power, and towing power of the X-Class and its competitors. The models have been listed and categorised by their engine type. Starting prices are for the base models of each engine type, unless otherwise stated. It must be noted that cabin and add-on features, or luxury lines have not been taken into account. For Mercedes-Benz, for example, the X250d 4×4 Progressive model starts at R696,785, while the X250d Power model starts at R791,315, while sharing the same engine.
