ICASA has announced a public hearing for a complaint lodged against MTN by Transnet, which will take on 19 March. The hearing will address MTN allegedly refusing to port certain numbers to another mobile network. It is alleged that MTN is in breach of ICASA’s number portability regulations. ICASA will hear the matter on an urgent basis in terms of regulation 6 of the Regulations Governing the Aspects of the Complaints and Compliance Committee Procedures. “This public hearing will afford both parties an opportunity to express their views on the matter and assist the committee to resolve this alleged non-compliance in line with applicable laws,” said ICASA. “Number portability regulations are an important pro-consumer regulation aimed at stimulating competition and promoting consumer choice.”
