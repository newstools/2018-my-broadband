Google is adding two enhancements to Chrome OS, according to a report by Softpedia. The first feature coming to Chromebooks is the ability for Chrome OS to preserve window positions across displays. The enhancement is already available in the Chrome OS developer channel, stated the report. Chromebook users will also receive an update for a floating virtual keyboard by default in future version of Chrome OS. “The floating virtual keyboard can be easily scaled and dragged anywhere on the screen, so that anyone can use it,” stated Softpedia.
