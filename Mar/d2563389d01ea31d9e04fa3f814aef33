Google has overhauled its job search experience. Job seekers using Google to look for jobs will now navigate a streamlined experience, said the company. “Finding employment is still very difficult for many people,” said Google South Africa. “With unemployment in South Africa so high, this new job search experience will help the millions of South Africans searching for new opportunities.” The improved job search function allows users to explore jobs from across the web and refine their search to meet their needs. Integration with Google Maps and alerts also lets users see where the job is located and receive notifications when new positions matching their search criteria become available. “As of today, job seekers in South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria will be able to use the new search experience to help them quickly and easily find opportunities.”
