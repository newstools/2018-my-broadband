CTS Labs has exposed potential security vulnerabilities in AMD’s Ryzen and EPYC processor lineups. Its report lists 13 vulnerabilities, which it said affect Ryzen, Ryzen Pro, Ryzen Mobile, and EPYC processors. The vulnerabilities require root-level operating system access to exploit and could allow attackers to access sensitive information. AMD responded to the CTS Labs report, stating that it is investigating and analysing the findings. “This company was previously unknown to AMD and we find it unusual for a security firm to publish its research to the press without providing a reasonable amount of time for the company to investigate and address its findings,” said AMD. “At AMD, security is a top priority and we are continually working to ensure the safety of our users as potential new risks arise.”
