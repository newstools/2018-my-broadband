Telkom has soft-launched a new online store, which is hosted at store.telkom.co.za. The online store features several product categories, including smartphones and accessories, computers and tablets, TV and multimedia, and connectivity. “Telkom is always looking for new and innovative ways to make products accessible to consumers,” the company told MyBroadband. “To this end, the company has soft-launched a new online store aimed at providing customers an easy and convenient way to purchase a diverse range of products.” “We have not yet publicised the store opening, as we are still in the process of ensuring a superior customer experience, and the soft-launch allows us the opportunity to do so.” The soft-launch follows Telkom sending a survey to customers in July 2017, asking them if they were interested in buying electronics through its website. Products on offer from the online store are shown in the screenshot below, and range from laptops to mesh Wi-Fi systems.
