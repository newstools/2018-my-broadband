The .ZA Domain Name Authority (ZADNA) is looking at allowing the registration of second level .za domain names. Currently, it you want to use a .za domain name, you must select an established second level domain like co.za, org.za, gov.za, or ac.za. This is set to change, and ZADNA has published a discussion document to get feedback on the best way to implement second level domain (SLD) registrations for .za. ZADNA said it regularly receives requests for second level domain registrations and private use SLDs (PUSLDs). The organisation highlighted that second level .za domains are not new, and predate the establishment of ZADNA. Historical private SLDs which ZADNA inherited when it assumed the management of .za domains include Agric.za, Grondar.za, and Nis.za. ZADNA said it has conducted a substantial assessment in the last year to determine the feasibility of SLD registrations and is upbeat about its prospects. “We are convinced that the implementation is likely to support the competitiveness of .za and enable .za to meet the changing online naming needs,” said ZADNA. If second level .za domain registrations are implemented, it means that users will be able to register yourname.za domains. The deadline for submissions on the ZADNA discussion document is 16 April 2018. The table below lists the active second level .za domains, based on ZADNA information.
