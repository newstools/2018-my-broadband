Vodacom World in Midrand will undergo major renovations and will be closed from 17 March until late 2018. The company said its overhauled Vodacom World mall will showcase the latest consumer technologies and offer a personalised in-store experience. “In line with our strategy to become a leading digital company, Vodacom World will undergo a digital transformation which will reposition it as the destination of choice – evolving from a one-stop cellular mall to a digitally-connected world,” said Vodacom. The company said its renovated mall will be “digital at the core” and will include a walk-in customer care environment as well as a repairs division. Vodacom urged customers in Johannesburg to visit their nearest Vodacom shops for any service requirements while Vodacom World is being renovated.
