I went to a bar the other day, and asked for the Wi-Fi password so I did not use my mobile data. I went to the bartender and said, “What’s the Wi-Fi password?” He replied, “You need to buy a drink first.” So I ordered a coke with ice and lemon, which was R20. “Great, so what’s the Wi-Fi password,” I asked. “You need to buy a drink first. No spaces, all lowercase,” he replied.
