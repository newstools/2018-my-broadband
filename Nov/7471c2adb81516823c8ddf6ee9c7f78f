YouTube is implementing back-to-back ads in a bid to reduce the number of interruptions users must incur. This change is being implemented after Google’s research showed that viewers find high frequencies of ad breaks frustrating. “We also learned that fewer interruptions is correlated with better user metrics,” added Google. Early experiment results showed an 8-11% increase in reach and a 5-10% increase in frequency for advertisers. Google hopes that YouTube users will appreciate that there are less breaks in their viewing, even if these breaks contain more than one advert. This new change will first be implemented on desktop devices, while mobile and TV viewers will receive this change before the end of this year.
