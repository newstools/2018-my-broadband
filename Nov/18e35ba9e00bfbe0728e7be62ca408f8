Chinese company Shadow Creator announced its new standalone VR headset at HTC’s Vive event yesterday. Notably, the Shadow VR is set to become the first standalone VR headset available to consumers – Oculus Quest is only set to release theirs in 6 months time. Sporting a 1,280 x 1,440 display, the Shadow VR doesn’t quite match up to the 1,600 x 1,440 display of the upcoming Oculus Quest, while it’s LCD screen is also inferior to the Quest’s OLED display. However, it uses use the same Snapdragon 835 chip that is found in the Oculus Quest and Vive Focus. It reportedly uses 6DoF controllers that were developed by Shadow Creator – the Vive Focus will use different 6DoF controllers. It will be priced at $399, which is the same price tag the Oculus Quest will have when it releases next year. The Shadow VR device will release on 11 November 2018.
