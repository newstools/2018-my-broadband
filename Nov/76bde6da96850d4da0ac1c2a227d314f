WhatsApp has stated that it will start showing adverts alongside the app’s Status feature, reported The Verge. WhatsApp Vice President Chris Daniels told journalist in India that the ads alongside the Status feature would be the “primary monetisation mode for the company”. It will offer an opportunity for businesses to reach people, but no rollout timeline was given. WhatsApp’s Status feature is similar to Instagram’s Stories feature, and lets users add images, text, and video to their profile for 24 hours. Softpedia News reported in August that WhatsApp will start displaying adverts in the Status screen from 2019. The confirmation from WhatsApp comes after the company launched its Business API in the same month. Businesses are able to respond to clients through the API for free for up to 24 hours – after which WhatsApp will charge a fixed rate per message.
