Mozilla has announced a new feature that allows users to track the prices of items online. Available as part of its Test Pilot programme, users can download the Price Wise feature for free from the Test Pilot website. The tool allows you to track individual products of interest, and will notify you when the product drops in price online. The tool tracks prices on Amazon, Best Buy, eBay, Home Depot, and Walmart. The timeous release of Price Wise will undoubtedly benefit Black Friday 2018 bargain hunters, who can use the tool to find the best deals online. Test Pilot was launched back in 2016, and allows any user to test early-stage Firefox features. Some of these features have become permanent Firefox features, including file transfer extension Send, and Side View. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
