Google has announced the latest version of its bot-detecting reCAPTCHA tool, reCAPTCHA v3. While previous versions of reCAPTCHA required users to pass human-detecting challenges such as reading distorted text or clicking a box, reCAPTCHA v3 does not require any user interaction. Starting with reCAPTCHA v2, Google began using a number of secondary signals to determine whether its was a human or bot making requests, and it has now expanded on this solution. “With reCAPTCHA v3, we are fundamentally changing how sites can test for human vs bot activities by returning a score to tell you how suspicious an interaction is and eliminating the need to interrupt users with challenges at all,” Google said. The tool functions using a new concept called actions, which allows for context-sensitive risk management via the analysis of request patterns. Website owners will also be able to view which pages are most targeted by bots, and Google recommends users add reCAPTCHA v3 to multiple pages for better pattern recognition.
