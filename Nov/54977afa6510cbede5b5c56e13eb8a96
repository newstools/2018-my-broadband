Google is being assisted by Microsoft as it works to bring Google Chrome to Microsoft’s Windows 10 on ARM platform, 9to5Google reports. This move comes as Windows 10 tries to catch up with other operating systems regarding support for ARM computers. Currently, Windows 10 on ARM users can emulate an x86 processor to use traditional Windows applications like Chrome for Windows 10. However, this emulation slows down these ARM devices greatly, effectively forcing users to utilise the built-in, ARM-compatible Microsoft Edge browser instead. While a partnership between Windows and Google has not officially been announced, two Microsoft developers have been contributing a significant amount of assistance to the project. This news is surprising given how Windows has previously taken significant steps to tout its Edge browser over alternatives on Windows 10. Microsoft and Google have previously worked together to bring Windows 10 dual-boot functionality to the Pixelbook. Additionally, Qualcomm recently told Android Authority that it is also working on the Chrome for Windows 10 on ARM initiative.
