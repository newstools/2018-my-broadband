SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has visited the company’s satellite broadband division and made major management changes to accelerate the timeline of the project. According to a Reuters report, Musk fired at least seven members of the project’s senior staff over disagreements regarding the pace of development. Starlink is SpaceX’s satellite broadband project, which aims to provide global Internet access via a network of hundreds of small satellites placed in low-Earth orbit. Musk reportedly replaced the fired staff with new managers from SpaceX headquarters, charging them to launch the first batch of satellites by the middle of 2019. Two test satellites have already been launched into orbit successfully, with SpaceX now looking to accelerate its development programme to meet an aggressive launch window.
