Apple recently launched its new MacBook Air laptop, which is thinner and more powerful than its previous version. Improvements over the previous-generation MacBook Air include an 8th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, TouchID, and a Force Touch trackpad with increased surface area. Like most new hardware, the MacBook Air now has much smaller bezels around its 13.3-inch Retina display. Additionally, the device also includes a dedicated T2 security chip and a pair of Thunderbolt 3-enabled USB-C ports for versatile connectivity. South African pricing has also been revealed for two MacBook Pro models, which are currently available for pre-order at the iStore. The full specifications of Apple’s new MacBook Air are detailed below. This device is certainly an improvement over the last generation of MacBook Air products, but its price remains relatively high compared to competing notebooks. Windows 10 laptops with equal or greater specifications can be purchased for less than the price of a MacBook Air, and without any unique hardware packed into the MacBook Air, Apple customers are essentially paying for the software and design of the device. To demonstrate the clear advantages of buying a Windows 10 laptop over the new MacBook Air, we have listed the specifications and key features of several 13-inch and 15-inch notebooks you can purchase for a similar price. Boasting an almost bezel-less display, the Dell XPS 13 is both lighter and smaller than the MacBook Air. The Dell XPS 13 is a Windows 10 competitor to the MacBook Air in terms of both performance and design, too, and the 256GB model is cheaper than the competing Apple device.  The ASUS Zenbook UX430UN delivers great ultrabook performance in a sleek and thin chassis at a lower price than the cheapest MacBook Air. The device sports a similar form factor and size to the MacBook Air, but manages to pack an Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics chip into its system, giving it a great advantage over the Apple device.  The Lenovo Ideapad Legion Y530 is a slim, powerful gaming notebook with discrete graphics you can buy for the price of Apple’s new MacBook Air. It is only slightly more bulky than the Apple device, but it boasts powerful specifications and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti graphics cards.  For a lower price than the 256GB MacBook Air, you could purchase an HP Envy x360 with a touch-screen display and a 512GB SSD. This impressive premium laptop is powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 processor with Radeon RX Vega 10 Graphics.
