Eskom announced that it has implemented Stage 1 load-shedding from 12:00 until 22:00 today to preserve emergency resources. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said the latest round of load-shedding was implemented due to high unplanned outages. The company advised South Africans to consult their load-shedding schedule for their area for more information. “We continue to appeal to residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period,” Eskom said in the statement. “Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand.” Today the Sunday Times reported that Eskom is on the verge of a coal and governance crisis. The report quoted energy analyst Ted Blom, who said that the “scale of Eskom’s supply, financial, and equipment problems” may result in it shutting down before the end of the year. Before this, however, there are chances of blackouts and load-shedding over the festive season as Eskom is dangerously low on coal. This all coincides with C-level executives being forced to leave Eskom in recent months under a cloud of corruption and maladministration accusations. Forensic reports have also recommended criminal probes into Eskom.
