Two MyBroadband employees recently had the unpleasant experience of having their Kulula flights cancelled without their knowledge. After investigating the issue, they realised that this occurred because they missed the outbound leg of their return flight. While it may not be widely known, Kulula warns that if you are a no-show on an outbound leg of a return flight, your inbound ticket will automatically be cancelled. What this means is that if you book a return ticket to somewhere, and do not get on the first flight to the destination, your later return ticket from that destination back home is automatically cancelled. Kulula’s terms and conditions for missed flights state: A no-show is not entitled to a refund for the value of the flight missed. Your return or onward flight segments will also be cancelled. To avoid your return flight being automatically cancelled, you must advise Kulula at least 45 minutes prior to the departure of your flight that you will not be able to make it. Some consolation is that you will retain the value of the return flight which may be re-booked upon request. “Depending on the type of ticket initially purchased you may incur a re-booking fee plus the difference in price between the new and old ticket,” Kulula said. To avoid missing a flight, Kulula advises passengers to check in 90 minutes before flight departure, as check-in desks close 45 minutes prior to scheduled departure.
