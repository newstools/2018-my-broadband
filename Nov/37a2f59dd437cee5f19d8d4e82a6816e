Windows director of program management for servicing and delivery John Cable outlined in a blog post how the company is working to improve Windows 10’s quality. The post comes in the wake of Windows pausing the October 2018 update due to reported data loss for many users. “In addition to our extensive internal validation, we have taken time to closely monitor feedback and diagnostic data from our Windows Insiders and from the millions of devices on the Windows 10 October Update,” said Cable. He added that Windows was monitoring the re-release of the October 2018 update. “We will offer the October Update to users via Windows Update when data shows your device is ready and you will have a great experience,” said Cable. “If we detect that your device may have an issue, such as an application incompatibility, we will not install the update until that issue is resolved.” Cable also announced that Windows plans to add an update status dashboard in 2019 to provide more information on any issues that lead to update blocks.
