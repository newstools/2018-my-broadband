Intel revealed its second-generation Neural Compute Stick 2 at its AI developer conference in Beijing. Like the original Neural Compute Stick, the device is the size of a traditional USB flash drive and is designed to deliver impressive neural network processing power in a portable form factor. The Neural Compute Stick 2 is based on Intel’s Movidius Myriad X vision processing unit (VPU), offering a large performance boost over the previous-generation device. The device boasts a dedicated neural network accelerator which delivers additional performance and supports Intel’s OpenVINO development toolkit. “The first-generation Intel Neural Compute Stick sparked an entire community of AI developers into action with a form factor and price that didn’t exist before,” said Intel corporate vice president Naveen Rao. “We’re excited to see what the community creates next with the strong enhancement to compute power enabled with the new Intel Neural Compute Stick 2,” Rao said. There is currently no release date or pricing for the Intel Neural Compute Stick 2.
