Google has announcedÂ it will be updating its Fast Pair tool to allow users to pair Bluetooth devices with multiple Android phones and tablets, as well as Chromebooks, at once. When you pair with one Google device, all devices in the vicinity that are connected to the same Google account will also be linked. Additionally, your Bluetooth devices will automatically remember which devices they have connected with previously, and will connect to them again when close by. Google said it is working with a variety of companies in the Bluetooth audio space to implement support for this new feature. Apple already allows for this functionality through its AirPods, which let users switch between various devices connected to the same iCloud account. This update has begun rolling out to devices that run Android 6.0 and higher. Chromebook users will have to wait until next year before the functionality is added.
