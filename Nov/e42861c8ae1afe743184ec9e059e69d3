Takealot will have over 10,000 deals at up to 60% off during its Black Friday 2018 sale. Speaking to MyBroadband, Takealot CEO Kim Reid stated that they will have deals on offer from 23 November – Black Friday – until 27 November, which is Takealot Tuesday. This also covers the Cyber Monday shopping day. This will be welcome news to local online consumers, as Takealot was by far the most popular choice in a recent MyBroadband survey about Black Friday 2018 shopping destinations. 72% of respondents said they plan to shop on Takealot during the sale period. The popularity of Takealot during Black Friday does have drawbacks, however, and it has been hit by website downtime in recent years during the busy period. In 2017, Takealot suffered from slow load times and unresponsive pages minutes into Black Friday 2017. It then temporarily took down the website to fix issues and process backlogged orders. Reid stated that Takealot has done extensive testing in preparation for Black Friday 2018, and will do its best to serve all customers. Reid stated that in 2017, the biggest sellers in rand terms over Black Friday were TVs, gaming consoles, and cellphones. In terms of unit sales, fragrances were the best sellers, he added. Takealot said in 2017 that on Black Friday it brought in R87 million in gross merchandising value, and its expects this to grow by 2.2-times in 2018. Reid said Takealot also had a good October this year, which bodes well for November and December sales.
