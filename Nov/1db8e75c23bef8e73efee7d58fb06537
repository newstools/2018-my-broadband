Reed Exhibitions Africa has unveiled its plans for the second edition of Comic Con Africa, which is set to take place from 21-24 September 2019. Following the success of the inaugural Comic Con Africa, next year’s event will take place over four days and will be hosted at Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand, Gauteng. This change was made to accommodate a higher number of fans, with the new venue offering a capacity of over 80,000 people. “We exceeded our own expectations in 2018 and you are going to see bigger and better in 2019,” said Reed Exhibitions Africa MD Carol Weaving. “We have listened to our fans first which means we needed to find a venue that is bigger, with more parking, more shade, easy access – and Gallagher Convention Centre fits this bill perfectly.” Comic Con Africa features interactive sessions with international celebrities, large esports tournaments, panel discussions, and more. “The four-day festival and the new venue will all help us to make Comic Con Africa the go-to event of the year for all things pop culture related once again, this event will bring the very best of this world together in one place,” Weaving said. Ticket sales for the second edition of Comic Con Africa will open at the end of November 2018.
