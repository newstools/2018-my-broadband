South African Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team Bravado Gaming has qualified for one of the biggest esports competitions in the world – Dreamhack Winter 2018. This follows Bravado’s recent win at the ESEA Mountain Dew League in the United States. The team moved to the United States earlier this year to play against high-level international teams and compete in bigger and more competitive tournaments. Qualifying for the Dreamhack Winter tournament is one of the team’s biggest accomplishments, said Bravado CS:GO squad coach Tiaan Coertzen. “It was important for us to qualify for the event because there is only one spot up for grabs per region in these qualifiers and you’re battling for it against more than 100 other teams who want it just as badly,” he said. Bravado played against top-ranked teams from the US and Brazil in the qualifying games, finally securing their spot in the tournament after a long and draining series of qualifiers. The team will depart for Sweden on November 24, where they will compete at the tournament from 30 November – 3 December. Dreamhack Winter, with over $100,000 up for grabs, will only be the team’s second major CS:GO tournament, but Bravado aims to win the entire event. “I believe we can win the whole event,” Coertzen said. “If we prepare well for all our games and continue putting in the hard work, anything is possible.”
