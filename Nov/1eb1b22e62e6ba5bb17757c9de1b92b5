Apple’s new iPad Pro recently received South African pricing, starting at R13,999 for the entry-level 11-inch model. While over R13,000 for a tablet may sound expensive, Apple has packed powerful hardware into the new iPads. This has allowed the iPad Pro to score close to a new MacBook Pro in terms of performance benchmarks. The 12.9-inch model, available in Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi + Cellular configurations, is particularly impressive thanks to its 120Hz display, powerful processor and graphics, and storage options of up to 1TB. For the top iPad Pro unit, though, you will have to fork out R33,999. If you choose the non-cellular option or smaller storage space, you will still be paying over R20,000 for an Apple tablet. Pricing for the new iPad Pro 12.9-inch is shown below. At these prices, the first question you may ask is: “Why not just buy a laptop?”.
