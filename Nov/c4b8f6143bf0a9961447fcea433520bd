Takealot announced that its annual Blue Dot Sale generated record sales on Black Friday. Within the first hour of the Black Friday sale, the retailer generated R11.5 million in sales, surpassing its gross sales revenue for the entirety of Black Friday 2017. The total transaction value for Black Friday 2018 on Takealot amounted to over R196 million – a 125% year-on-year growth in sales and 127% growth in orders. 68% of shoppers buying Black Friday deals on Takealot placed orders on their mobile phones via the Takealot app and mobile site. “We are humbled by the incredible support from our customers on our biggest sales day of the year,” said Takealot CEO Kim Reid. “Black Friday is a great opportunity for first-time shoppers to trial online shopping and this year we saw a record number of new buyers make the most of the deals on offer.” Reid said that the retailer paid special attention to securing quality deals on top brands. “Electronics again proved to be a firm favourite with over three thousand TVs sold on the day,” he said. Best-selling items included perfume, camping gear such as folding tables, portable hard drives, and the DStv Explora 2 decoder. While the Takealot website remained up and running for the whole day on Black Friday, intermittent issues with the retailer’s credit card payment provider resulted in customers relying on alternative payment methods such as iPay and Payfast to complete their purchases. Takealot said its delivery team is now focusing on meeting the estimated delivery dates shared with customers at checkout. The Takealot Blue Dot Sale extends through the weekend into Cyber Monday, culminating in Takealot Tuesday with hundreds of new deals being added daily.
