Game developer Arcade Distillery is set to launch a blockchain-based video game for the PlayStation 4. The title is named Plague Hunters and uses non-fungible tokens transacted on the Ethereum blockchain. Plague Hunters is a single-player, turn-based strategy role-playing game with some PvP elements, and is the sequel to Plague Road. The game will be free-to-play, and various in-game assets such as items, units, and weapons will be tethered to ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Plague Hunters has successfully passed Sonyâ€™s review process, making it the first blockchain-based game to be approved for the console. The game is set to release in the first quarter of 2019, and the developer is also working to bring the game to PC and the Nintendo Switch.
