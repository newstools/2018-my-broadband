WhatsApp has officially launched a public beta programme for iOS, allowing iPhone users to test the latest features of the app, WABetaInfo reports. A public beta programme for Android and Windows Phone has been available for some time now. It should be noted that the WhatsApp public beta is meant to test upcoming features, with users offering feedback and reporting bugs on the beta build. Slots for the iOS WhatsApp public beta programme are limited, and interested users should sign up as soon as possible. To join the WhatsApp public beta, iOS users can download TestFlight from the App Store and visit the WhatsApp Messenger Beta page to sign up. Beta testers will retain their chat history and settings, although it is recommended that they back up their chats before updating to a new version of the beta.
