Cell C has launched a new out-of-bundle Spend Control service which aims to reduce unwanted out-of-bundle data usage. Using this service, Cell C customers will be able to decide whether they want to automatically be billed for out-of-bundle usage and by how much they want to go out-of-bundle. Customers will be able to define out-of-bundle usage rules for voice, SMS, and data separately. “The service is totally flexible and allows customers to change these settings at no cost at any stage, thus ensuring that customers have complete and unrestricted control over their costs,” Cell C said. This Spend Control feature will be available through USSD menus and the Cell C app. The mobile operator is also set to launch its new bundle depletion notifications, which apply to all services included in postpaid and top-up contracts in addition to data bundles. In line with new regulations published by ICASA, Cell C is working to expand its data rollover service to extend the validity of data before it expires. Cell C is also in the process of improving and expanding its data rollover service to make sure customers have ways to extend the validity of any data they have before it expires. The company said it is also finalising its data transfer service which will allow customers to transfer any data to other Cell C customers. Both the new notifications and Spend Control feature will be available to customers from later in November.
