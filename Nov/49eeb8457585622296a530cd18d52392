NASA’s InSight spacecraft has successfully landed on Mars and will soon begin work on investigating the planet. InSight stands for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, and is equipped with instruments to study the interior of the planet. The lander will also examine seismic activity such as marsquakes, meteorite impacts, and dust storms, and will track the wobble of Mars’ North Pole using a pair of antennas. InSight was initially launched in May 2018 and successfully touched down on the surface of Mars last night. Once the lander’s solar panels have deployed correctly, it will begin deploying its instruments and collecting data which could be crucial for future Mars missions. Recent breakthroughs in technology have accelerated the timeline for the human colonisation of Mars, according to Elon Musk. Speaking in a recent interview with HBO, Musk said there is now around a 70% chance that he will be able to move to Mars. Watch NASA mission control successfully land the InSight spacecraft below.
