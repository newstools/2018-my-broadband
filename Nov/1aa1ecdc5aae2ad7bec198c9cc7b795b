Game’s Black Friday 2018 deals brochure was posted online yesterday, but was not done so officially by Game. The company has stated that the deals were leaked, and it is looking to find the source of the leak. “Game’s Black Friday product specials were leaked by an unknown source,” said Massdiscounters MD Albert Voogd. “We have made every effort to keep details of these incredible deals under wraps until Black Friday, which falls on 23 November this year. However, this information has now been circulated by people across mobile chat groups and social media,” he said. “A certain online platform even published Game’s Black Friday specials without our approval.” Voogd said it is clear that people are “very eager to find out what is on offer at Game this Black Friday” – even to the point of hunting out the deals from unofficial sources. “We too are now also on the hunt – to find the source of the leak.” “But these leaked specials are only a few of the unbeatable deals we will have on offer in store and online this Black Friday,” said Voogd. “We have gone the extra mile to source unbeatable deals that offer huge savings for our customers. Our customers should watch for many more exciting offers from Game over the course of next week, leading up to Black Friday.”
