Pargo has partnered with Spar and the Lewis Group to become the largest pick-up point network in South Africa, now supporting over 2,000 stores. Pargo is a smart logistics company which offers partnered retailers delivery to a Pargo point of the buyer’s choosing instead of their address, with the buyer then able to pick up their product at their specified point. Buyers can now pick up and drop off their parcels at selected Spar, Lewis, Beares, and Best Home and Electric stores. Pargo said this partnership will strengthen the reach of its network, especially in more rural areas where delivery can be expensive. “Logistics is recognised worldwide as a friction point in ecommerce while it is a key enabler for the growth of online companies” said Derk Hoekert, Pargo cofounder. “This is especially true in the African environment where 75% of the population lives in areas that are challenging and expensive to service.” Pargo’s existing partners include FNB, OneDayOnly, Cape Union Mart, African Bank, Clicks, Caltex, and more. The company said it aims to continue growing its network and place a pick-up point within 2km of every South African.
