Earlier in 2018, South African tech shoppers were surprised to discover that a third-party seller called Newegg was selling goods on the Makro website. Newegg is a well-known American computer hardware and consumer electronics retailer based in California, and has a good reputation among technology enthusiasts. Selling its goods through Makro’s website without any fanfare was surprising, in part because Makro is a Walmart subsidiary. However, it was not completely unwarranted as Newegg is busy with a global expansion drive. Makro’s website is not open to just any third-party seller who wishes to sell their goods on the platform. The company said it partners with a select group of suppliers, and initially explained to MyBroadband that Newegg was selling products through its online marketplace. However, Newegg stated on Twitter that it has no relationship with Makro. Thanks for asking. We do not have a partnership with Makro in South Africa nor sell any products through them. — Newegg (@Newegg) October 30, 2018  MyBroadband contacted Newegg to confirm whether it had a relationship with Walmart or with Makro specifically. Newegg did not respond by the time of publication. Makro then told MyBroadband that it does not have a relationship with Newegg. An eagle-eyed MyBroadband reader said that a retailer called FirstShop, operated by First Technology, had changed its name on the Makro website to Newegg, however. Makro confirmed that a local seller on its marketplace was trading under the Newegg name, and that it had asked the seller to change the name on its listings as it was creating confusion. It confirmed that the local seller was FirstShop. FirstShop declined to comment regarding its name change on the Makro Marketplace. Products on the Makro Marketplace which previously listed the partner as Newegg currently list the seller as “Tech Deals”.
