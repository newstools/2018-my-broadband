CipherWave has been growing its national fibre network over the past 8 years, resulting in a footprint which interconnects between several provider networks. These provider networks include DFA, OpenServe, Liquid Telecom, MFN, LinkAfrica, Vumatel, Octotel, IS, and many other independent fibre network providers. “Over the last 18 months, our key focus has been on our DFA network which resulted in us investing in a partnership to upgrade our capacity in the Gauteng and Pretoria metros,” said CipherWave’s Managing Director Wayne D’sa. This upgrade covers 14 main nodes connecting numerous POPs (Points of Presence), including CipherWave’s primary datacenter in Midrand and secondary datacenter in Isando. The decision to focus on the Gauteng and Pretoria Metros was due to customer requirements for higher speed bandwidth in these areas. CipherWave also has a national footprint with POPs in Teraco Isando, Teraco Cape Town, and Teraco Durban. Managing their own network as well as having access to large scale capacity provides CipherWave with the flexibility to offer their customers the bandwidth they require – both today and in the future. With more services moving into both local and international clouds, bandwidth has become a key infrastructure dependency. Coupled with a wide fibre backbone coverage, CipherWave’s international bandwidth runs across east and west coast undersea cable systems that provide redundancy in the event of an undersea cable failure. CipherWave has more fibre options than ever before to get customers connected. Their strategy was to develop a network that is robust, operated and managed by themselves, and allows them to increase their customers’ bandwidth should they need to do so. They felt the only way to do this was to invest in a footprint that could offer this scalability. The Johannesburg and Pretoria metros are the start of their upgrade path and they are already reviewing their Cape Town and Durban footprints. While these areas have adequate fibre coverage today across a number of fibre providers, CipherWave is looking to take a similar approach to that which they have taken in Gauteng. CipherWave’s 3 core services are connectivity, cloud, and voice services. The connectivity offering includes wireless, fibre Internet access, and fibre access (point-to-point fibre). As a result of their fibre network and international bandwidth capacities, they have been able to create business fibre connectivity packages which are flexible and will meet their clients’ business bandwidth requirements.
