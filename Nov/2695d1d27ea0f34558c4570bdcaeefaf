The minister of public service and administration, Ayanda Dlodlo, has announced that from 2019 people will not need work experience to get an entry-level government job. The decision was welcomed by the National Youth Development Agency, which through a media statement said Dlodlo announced the news this morning. It added that the government will also introduce a new Z83 application form, which will be available online. “The NYDA has been at the centre of this discourse… we remained steadfast that the only practical way to reduce the high youth unemployment rate in the immediate is scrapping of experience for all entry-level jobs,” it said. In a report by the Daily Dispatch, Dlodlo was quoted as saying they are “scrapping the need for experience for entry-level jobs” as they continually look to “alleviate the crisis of unemployment, especially among South African youth”. It must be noted that the South African government is under pressure to cut spending, particularly on government salaries, as its debt continues to grow.
