Connect with friends and family this holiday. Get a month of free connectivity from RSAWEB in the Festive Fibre Sale. Technology has impacted every facet of our lives in incredible ways, services like Uber make it easier to get around, WhatsApp keeps us in touch and accessible 24/7 and Facebook helps us keep tabs on almost everyone we know. One thing that hasn’t changed as much as everything else is how we spend our holidays. The festive season has always been a time to connect, get together with family and hang out with friends.
