Black Friday 2018 has arrived, and many South African retailers are offering big discounts on tech products this year. Black Friday is well known in the United States as the start of the Christmas shopping season, but it is only in recent years that South Africa joined this tradition. The popularity of Black Friday grew rapidly in South Africa, and most large retailers are now offering deals on the day. A new trend in South Africa is for stores to offer specials for the whole weekend – from 23 to 25 November – and not just on Black Friday itself. Makro has gone even further by offering its Black Friday deals from Wednesday 21 November to Sunday 25 November. Here are some of the best Black Friday tech deals in South Africa.
