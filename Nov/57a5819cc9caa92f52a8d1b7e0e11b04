Cell C’s fixed-LTE service offered through local ISPs is the best fixed-LTE deal in the country when looking at price. The LTE packages are offered through numerous local ISPs and are very competitively priced. Sweetening the deal is that they are offered on a month-to-month basis, which means users are not forced to sign a 24-month contract. This is not the case with competing offers from Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom – all of which sell fixed-LTE packages directly. The networks offer 24-month contract options for the services, and often at higher prices. Cell C also directly offers fixed-LTE 24-month contracts, which are more expensive than the month-to-month ISP packages. Following the suspension of Rain’s fixed-LTE packages through local ISPs, there has been little competition for the Cell C offering in terms of price and not having to sign a contract. When looking at LTE deals, however, there are other factors which must be taken into account. It is important to note that the LTE router you receive may differ depending on the package you select. For example, the packages from ISPs come with the choice of a Huawei B315 router by default, or a Huawei B618 for an additional R999 once-off. Contract packages from the mobile networks typically only offer one router, but in MTN’s case users can pick a Sharelink B612 or Sharelink B618. This will affect the monthly price, however. Coverage in your specific area must also be taken into consideration, as poor coverage from a provider may render their deal – regardless of price – less effective than a competing offer.
