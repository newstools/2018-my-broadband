While Amazon is hiring 100,000 additional workers for its busy holiday season, this number is down from its 2016 and 2017 additions. According to a report by Quartz, in the past two years it hired 120,000 additional workers. The decline in hiring is thanks to Amazon’s success with automating operations in its warehouses, Citi analyst Mark May said. May said the increased use of robots in Amazon fulfillment centres means Amazon can do more with fewer workers. He added that this is “the first time on record Amazon plans to hire fewer holiday workers than it did the previous year”, stated Quartz. Amazon has increased the use of automated systems and robots in its warehouses in recent years, and the reprot stated its “orange robots” can handle sorting, packing, and shipping tasks in 15 minutes which would take a human worker one hour.
