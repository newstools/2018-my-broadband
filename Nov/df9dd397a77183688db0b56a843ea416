Showmax and Vodacom have launched a deal with free access to Showmax for three months – along with free streaming data. The promotion is on offer to Vodacom customers, who can add Showmax to their bill between 1 November 2018 and 31 January 2019 to receive 15GB of free Showmax data – 5GB per month for three months. “On top of this, the usual Showmax R99 per month subscription fee will be waived for three months. There’s no contract or lock-in period,” said Showmax. To sign up for the deal, visit www.showmax.com/vodacom, with the deal open to both prepaid and contract customers. Once a user’s free three-month period is over, they can then choose to subscribe to Showmax at a discounted rate of R49 per month for the following nine months. “In total, this means that a year of Showmax, which would normally cost R1,188, will instead only cost R441.” It added that the Showmax app also offers bandwidth-capping functionality which lets users use less data to stream content. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
