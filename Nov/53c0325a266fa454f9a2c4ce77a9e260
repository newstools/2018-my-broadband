According to market research firm GfK South Africa, South African smartphone sales rose by 16% in the third quarter of 2018 when compared to the same period last year. The overall technical goods market also grew by nearly 7% this quarter when compared to the third quarter of 2017. “Smartphone unit sales continue to be driven by mid-range to entry-level devices,” said GfK South Africa’s head of market insights Kali Moahloli. Moahloli added that new high-end flagship phones were also powering the growth in value of the market. According to GfK’s research, consumer electronics revenue also grew by 6.4% in Q3 of 2018, compared to Q3 of 2017, with audio speakers and panel TV’s performing particularly well. Media tablets, however, dropped by double digits compared to the same time last year, and GfK noted that consumers tend to opt for cheaper tablets from lesser-known brands.
