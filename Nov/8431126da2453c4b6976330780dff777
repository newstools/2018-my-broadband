Engadget reports that Facebook is considering allowing users to block content with specific terms from appearing on their walls. The report comes after a computer science student, Jane Manchun Wong, found code that shows the company testing this feature. The possible terms that users could block would reportedly include words, phrases, and emojis. This feature would not stop these posts from being published – it would just be hidden from view of the person who blocked the terms. This feature would serve as an alternative to the traditional blocking mechanism, allowing users to continue viewing other content that doesn’t contain the specified keywords. Instagram already offers a similar filtering system which allows users to hide comments containing unwanted terms.
