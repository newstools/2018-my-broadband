Jaguar Land Rover has launched its new Range Rover Evoque luxury compact SUV, which is available with a choice of 2.0-litre diesel and petrol engines. “With design and capability at its heart and the latest technology to hand, the new Range Rover Evoque meets your needs like never before and ensures you reach your destination, no matter the conditions,” said Jaguar Land Rover global marketing director Finbar McFall. The Evoque sports slim matrix LED headlamps and flush door handles, and can be outfitted with premium alternatives to leather, such as wool blend and suedecloth. Inside the cabin, a twin touchscreen system runs improved infotainment software, and 16-way seat controls along with cabin air ionisation allow for maximum comfort. Additionally, the vehicle’s rear-view mirror transforms into an HD video screen with a 50-degree field of view, providing an unobstructed view when reversing. The new Range Rover Evoque has a slightly longer wheelbase than previous models, allowing for increased luggage and small item storage. The Evoque also features all-wheel drive, and uses terrain response technology to automatically detect the surface below the vehicle and adjust its setup. “Underneath the skin is an engineering and technical revolution,” said Jaguar Land Rover Product Engineering executive director Nick Rogers. “The architecture is all-new, with only the door hinges remaining unchanged on the body.” Below are the specifications of the new Range Rover Evoque. There is currently no local pricing information available for the new Range Rover Evoque. Jaguar Land Rover said the new compact SUV would be available in South African in Q1 2019.
