Multiple Telkom users have reported that the company’s 450GB Night Surfer data deal is back. The offer is part of Telkom’s Mo’Nice deals range, and can be accessed by dialling *123#. The “return” of the deal comes after Telkom customers stated in recent weeks that they could not access the deal via the Mo’Nice menu. Telkom launched the Night Surfer special – which offers 450GB of LTE data, valid for 30 days, for R59 – following the cancellation of its 500GB for R50 LTE promotion. Unlike the 500GB deal, the 450GB deal is not available to all users and must be provided to them via the Mo’Nice menu. The platform provides users with customised offers based on their usage behaviour, and “customers who tend to use data during the night may periodically be offered customised Night Surfer bundles”. “Customised offers on the Mo’Nice platform are based on a number of factors, including customer usage behaviour. A customer’s unique usage pattern determines the type of offers made available to them,” Telkom previously stated. Telkom customers who state they regularly use Night Surfer data have not seen the deal of late, until it started popping up again this week. MyBroadband was also presented with the deal when we visited the Mo’Nice platform on our Telkom test device this morning, The data options presented to us, as shown in the image below, were:
