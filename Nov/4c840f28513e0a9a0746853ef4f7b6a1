GigaGo: “Let’s help you choose the right package that will suit your lifestyle needs: For day to day tasks, like emailing, updating your social media status, Skype, and movie streaming, a 5 to 10 Mbps package is a great entry level option.  Those using more than 3 devices on a connection should consider upgrading to larger package. Packages from 20 to 40 Mbps will show you what fibre Internet is really about. This line can reliably support HD streaming for up to five devices simultaneously, and is ideal for casual gamers who require rapid, reliable speeds. A 100Mbps line speed on the other hand is for the more serious Internet user. This package is perfect for homes where multiple users are making use of high-bandwidth-use applications such as 4K streaming, online gaming, seamless video calls, and urgent research.
