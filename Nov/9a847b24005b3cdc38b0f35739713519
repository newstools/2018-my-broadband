NTT Group has selected Dimension Data CEO Jason Goodall to lead the new NTT global operating company, BusinessTech reports. Goodall will assume the role of CEO at NTT’s global business from 1 July 2019, subject to a formal approval process. “In the meantime, Jason will continue his responsibilities as CEO for Dimension Data,” NTT said. This follows NTT Group’s announcement earlier this year that a new holding company called NTT Inc. will be created to house four operating companies – Dimension Data, NTT Communications, NTT DATA, and NTT Security. The company has also created a new global innovation fund to accelerate the development technology in the global market, called NTT Venture Capital L.P. Goodall has served in the CEO position at Dimension Data since June 2016, after previously serving as COO at the company.
