Having a high-speed, stable Internet connection is crucial in a fast-paced environment where corporates need to make things happen for customers who expect fast turnaround times. MetroFibre has been identified as one of the top ISPs, providing fibre to the home (FTTH), broadband, and customised internet and business connection solutions for residents, SMEs, and corporates. While being an ISP themselves, MetroFibre Networx builds fibre networks that carry highly-managed fibre broadband connectivity – providing other South African ISPs with reliable fibre infrastructure. Boasting South Africa’s first globally compliant Carrier Ethernet (CE2.0) open-access fibre network, MetroFibre is well-equipped to meet business and home fibre needs. Their network connects over 60 Internet Service Providers, voice, cloud, and application services to a large customer base. Their customers include Internet Service Providers, property developers, resellers, residential users, and businesses – meaning that they have the experience and infrastructure to deal with a vast array of connectivity requirements. MetroFibre also offers a variety of additional business features. These include their 100% cloud-based Business Voice solution, as well as their Data Centre Express connectivity solution – which allows for the efficient managing of your data centres. Body corporates of complexes and estates are also served by MetroFibre. The installation of a fibre infrastructure within these areas is available to body corporates at no additional cost. MetroFibre even offers connections to communal areas including public swimming pools and clubhouses. Property developers will also find MetroFibre’s fibre installations to be highly beneficial. Whether building new properties or renovating older ones, fibre connectivity will increase the value of the property and make it more attractive to potential buyers or renters. “We work closely with the trustees of the body corporate or property developer to plan the installation of the infrastructure to minimise disruption and trenching after residents have moved in.  In some instances, we have also assisted with fibre for the security gate house, cameras, and voice for communal areas,” said MetroFibre Networx. Many business parks – which require reliable fibre solutions for their tenants and owners – can also use MetroFibre which will provide them with customised solutions, based on their unique needs – developed and installed free of charge. MetroFibre has a robust team of customer care agents who are committed to solving issues that direct customers have. The agents take ownership of the query, remaining focused on the customer care tickets until it is resolved. MetroFibre Networx is a level 4 contributor to BBBEE, which means that customers can also claim procurement on all of their spend.
