President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced that the Department of Communications and the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services will be merged. The former Minister of Telecommunications Siyabonga Cwele is now the new Minister of Home Affairs. Nomvula Mokonyane will be appointed as Environmental Affairs minister, stepping down from the top position at the now-former Department of Communications. Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams will head up the new merged department, and will serve as the Minister of Telecommunications. Ramaphosa said this is the first in a wave of moves to help with the “realigning process in order to put into the effect the transformation we are affecting with regards to economic management”. This follows former president Jacob Zuma splitting the Communications Ministry into two separate departments in December 2014. This resulted in a “legislative nightmare and confusing reporting lines”, the DA said at the time.
