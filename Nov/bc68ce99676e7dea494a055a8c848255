WhatsApp is working on new QR code-based tools which will allow users to easily share contact info and add contacts, WABetaInfo reports. While these tools are not yet available on the iOS or Android version of the app, the company has reportedly been working on these new features for weeks, adding improvements in recent updates. WhatsApp is implementing QR codes within its Add Contact menu, allowing users to simply scan a QR code and automatically add the contact to their application. Users will also be able to share their own QR code, allowing others to add them without physically taking down their number. The app is also improving a feature which lets users add new contacts from within WhatsApp itself instead of having to navigate out of the app and into their deviceâ€™s phone book. Selecting the Add Contact option will now prompt users to entry the country code and number of the user they wish to add, and will then display a prompt stating whether that number has an active WhatsApp account. These features are not yet available on the iOS or Android versions of WhatsApp, but are expected to launch soon.
