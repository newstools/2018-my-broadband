A new report by IntSights Cyber Intelligence and Riskified shows a big increase in ecommerce phishing attacks. As covered by Softpedia News, scammers are increasingly impersonating websites of well-known brands to harvest user information and payment details. The report looked at “hundreds of millions of purchases” between Q3 2017 and Q3 2018, and found that the number of fake retailer websites increased by 297%. “As ecommerce continues its explosive growth, fraud has followed suit. This makes it very difficult for merchants to distinguish good customers from bad actors,” stated the researchers. To put this into perspective, in Q3 2018, each retail company examined was targeted by roughly 23 phishing attack fake websites. Fake apps and fake social media accounts in the sector have also increased substantially, added the report. The fact that retailers are using multiple channels to drive sales – such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter – means there are more avenues for attackers to try and exploit customers.
