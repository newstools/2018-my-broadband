Deezer has partnered with Jacaranda FM and East Coast Radio, allowing its users to access the two radio stations from within the streaming service. To stream Jacaranda FM and East Coast Radio, users can log in to their Deezer profile and click through to either radio station in the “Deezer Recommends” section of their homepage. Deezer added that this live radio feature will soon have its own channel, which will display popular radio stations and sort them by category. Through this channel, users will be able to stream their preferred radio stations on mobile or desktop directly through the Deezer platform. “Music lovers in South Africa now have the option to listen to their Flow, stream their favourite artists and listen to the hottest playlists, as well as access their favourite local radio shows,” said Deezer Africa head of operations Gillian Ezra. “We are very excited to launch with Jacaranda and ECR, two of South Africa’s most loved stations.” The music streaming service said it expects to partner with further radio stations in the future.
