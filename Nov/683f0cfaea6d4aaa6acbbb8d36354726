According to a report by Datto, ransomware attacks on Apple OS and iOS devices are up by nearly 500% compared to last year. This finding forms part of a comprehensive report on how ransomware is affecting SMBs worldwide. 55% ofÂ managed service providers (MSPs) report attacks against their clients in the first half of 2018 alone. On average, MSPs report over 5 attacks per year, per client. The average ransom request is $4,300, although downtime costs are over ten times as costly to SMBs. The most popular industry to be attacked by ransomware is construction and manufacturing, closely followed by professional services and finance. However, Datto reports that 90% of businesses that utilise business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) recover from the ransomware attack within a day.
