WhatsApp is rolling out a new contact ranking system, as reported by WABetaInfo. The report stated that the new feature is available for iOS Beta users, but is not available on Android yet. The ranking feature automatically ranks contacts by detecting “which contacts you interact with more”. It analyses how often you chat to contacts, if you call a contact, if you and other contacts are in the same group, and if you view or ignore a contact’s status updates. The ranking system then orders your contacts in the Status updates screen from most important to least important – instead of listing them chronologically. The report noted that the ranking system works locally and no data is sent to WhatsApp.
