The official Telkom Twitter account has responded to a user complaining about the provider’s service delivery without seemingly examining the context, resulting in an embarrassing situation for the company’s social media team. Earlier today, professional Fortnite player Dennis “Cloak” Lepore said in a tweet that “Spectrum might be the worst internet provider ever”. Spectrum is an ISP which serves users in the US. A South African Twitter user named Jonathan Oliver then responded to Lepore’s tweet, stating “Nah @TelkomZA takes the number 1 spot”. https://twitter.com/Varriable_/status/1059337336809549824 It is clear from the conversation that both users were complaining about the service of certain Internet service providers, but Telkom on Twitter apparently missed this context in its response to Oliver. Telkom responded with the following: “Yass and your continuous support keeps us up there! Thank you…” This reply drew ridicule from a number of South African Twitter users before it was deleted by Telkom. However, many users managed to capture screenshots of the message before it was removed, such as the one posted below.  MyBroadband reached out to Telkom for comment on the tweet, but the company did not provide a response by the time of publication.
