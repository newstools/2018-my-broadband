Microsoft announced that mouse and keyboard support will soon begin rolling out to Xbox One users. Initial support for the control method will begin rolling out next week, although only selected titles will be enabled at launch for Xbox Insiders. Microsoft also said that in order to have the best mouse and keyboard experience for Xbox One, gamers should use “Designed for Xbox” mice and keyboards. “These are created for living room or desktop scenarios, come equipped with a dedicated Xbox key, and support the new Xbox Dynamic Lighting feature,” Microsoft said. “Razer will be the exclusive partner to ship a Designed for Xbox mouse and keyboard and will formally introduce the product at CES in January.” Epic Games has stated that Fortnite will be one of the first titles to offer mouse and keyboard support, along with a number of other games including Warframe, War Thunder, Vermintide 2, and Bomber Crew.
