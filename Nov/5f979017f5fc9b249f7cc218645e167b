Apple CEO Tim Cook told an interviewer on HBO that despite the company’s distrust of Google’s security stance, Apple still chooses to use Google’s search engine because it is superior to the alternatives. He added that Apple had implemented a variety of its own security measures to limit any concerns regarding Google’s alleged “surveillance.” “We have private web browsing. We have an intelligent tracker prevention. What we’ve tried to do is come up with ways to help our users through the course of the day,” said Cook. He added that while the arrangement was not perfect, it still goes a long way to ensuring their users have the best possible experience. Cook recently spoke out against the private practices of big tech companies, saying that the management of our personal data should “make us very uncomfortable.”
