Huawei has launched its new range of smart wearables in South Africa, including its high-end Watch GT smartwatch. The company launched eight devices in total, each of which are compatible with all smartphone operating systems. “There has been a massive surge in popularity of smart wearable devices over the past few years,” said Huawei South Africa CTO Akhram Mohamed. “At the same time, Huawei has increasingly grown its share of the mobile phone market globally, so it made sense for us to expand into the wearables market, given that this is an area where we can provide an even wider range of premium fashion and technical products to support everyday users at affordable prices,” he added. While Huawei’s first smart wearables were launched in 2015, they have only now entered the South African market. The lineup includes the Watch GT, which boasts a battery life of up to two weeks and is available in two designs – Sport and Classic. Other products include the Huawei Band 3e and Band 2 Pro, which offer a range of features for active consumers. These devices will be available from Incredible Connection, Takealot, Makro, and Sportsmans Warehouse this year, with the following distribution plan: Below is the full list of Huawei smart wearables launched in South Africa, along with their pricing.
