Telkom has published its interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2018, detailing its latest employee numbers. The company continues to cut employees as it aims to lower costs, losing almost 200 employees since March 2018. Employees at Telkom were being offered voluntary separation and early retirement packages as of 14 September 2018, with the company citing the need to remain competitive as a major factor in this decision. The expense of this initiative was reflected in the company’s interim results, with Telkom paying out R282 million as part of the voluntary severance and retrenchment process. Telkom has lost 191 employees since March 2018, bringing its staff count below 10,000 for the first time in decades. The company’s interim results reflect that the company currently employees 9,952 staff, around 1.9% less than the 10,143 it had as of March 2018. It is important to note the employee numbers referenced in this article are for the Telkom company, which includes the Consumer, Openserve, and Corporate Centre divisions. The employee numbers for BCX, Yellow Pages, and Gryo are reflected separately and also show a steady decline in staff numbers. Since September 2017, BCX has lost 346 employees, which equates to an overall decline of just over 4.4% – leaving it with 7,432 employees as of 30 September 2018. Yellow Pages and Gyro suffered more severely, with staff percentage declines of 21.3% and 53.6% respectively. Gyro lost over half of its staff in the last year and is now left with 98 employees, whereas Yellow Pages now employs 380 staff. It is not clear whether Telkom will continue with its voluntary severance and retrenchment process, resulting in the loss of more employees across its divisions.
