Altron’s Altech Radio Holdings has rebranded as Altron Nexus, the company announced. “The name change comes in the wake of Altron’s new brand repositioning which unites all its businesses under one brand identity,” said Brett Nash, MD of Altron Nexus. “Previously, as Altech Radio Holdings, our business initially derived its revenue from two-way radio communications. Now as Altron Nexus, we provide broadband solutions while remaining the largest provider of mission-critical public safety solutions in sub-Saharan Africa.” Nash added that the new brand “truly resonates with what we do in defining us as an ICT solutions partner”. “We would like customers and partners to see us as innovators and integrators in both the broadband and narrowband space.”
