Leading ICT infrastructure and smart device provider Huawei took to the stage at the 2018 MyBroadband Conference & Expo, which took place at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand on 18 October, outlining South Africa’s broadband future. According to Huawei South Africa chief strategy architect and speaker at the conference Miguel Geraldes, broadband makes up a fundamental part in the digital landscape. Geraldes further stated that the rollout of 5G in South Africa could enable greater fibre coverage. “The number of additional fibre connections required to enable 5G networks could support improved fibre-to-the-home connectivity across the country,” said Geraldes. According to Geraldes, this will be a huge opportunity for South Africa to deploy fixed broadband at a larger scale and could dramatically increase the number of fibre-connected South Africans by 2021. “I’m very enthusiastic as to how South Africa can catch up to more developed countries. I think the introduction of 5G will accelerate the process.” The MyBroadband Conference & Expo provides IT executives, managers, and business owners from various industries a platform to interact and do business with South Africa’s top cloud and hosting providers.
