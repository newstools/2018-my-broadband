Microsoft has announced that it is adding a light theme to its Windows 10 operating system. Dark themes have become popular options on a variety of operating systems, including macOS Mojave, and Windows 10 previously implemented its own dark theme in its recent October update. Microsoft, however, has taken this trend a step further by offering a lighter alternative to the default Windows 10 theme. This new light theme will be included in the next feature update for Windows 10. Certain areas of the operating system that were previously dark regardless of theme selection will now be lightened by enabling this new option. To change to the full-light experience, users will simply need to navigate to the colors tab in the Windows 10 personalisation menu, and choose the “light” color from the drop-down box.
