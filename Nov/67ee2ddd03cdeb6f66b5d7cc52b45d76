While MultiChoice has confirmed it is working on a streaming service to take on Netflix, there is still no firm launch date for the product. MultiChoice South Africa CEO Calvo Mawela told MyBroadband in May that it was working on the service, but securing the streaming rights for all the entertainment content they offer on their existing DStv packages was a hurdle to clear. The move by MultiChoice comes after the success of Netflix globally and in South Africa, with Netflix offering a wide range of content at a much lower price point than DStv Premium. As part of its fightback, MultiChoice also launched a new video unit for OTT services called Connected Video, which is led by CEO Niclas Ekdahl. Answering questions from MyBroadband following a recent media briefing, Ekdahl said the company is working on the DStv streaming service – but no firm launch date has been set. It has been previously estimated by industry players that the service will launch in 2019. Ekdahl added that DStv’s current online offering, DStv Now, is reaching up to 250,000 daily active users. DStv Now lets existing DStv customers watch their satellite package of channels online through supported apps or a web browser. He added that they are currently working on improving the interface of DStv Now for users so their ability to discover content is optimised. DStv Now is also getting work done on its adaptive bitrates, with the aim of reducing the bitrate for the lowest-quality video setting. This is to give customers more options when it comes to managing data usage. Currently, DStv Now offers the following quality settings.
