Samsung Pay was launched in South Africa on 21 August 2018, offering users a secure and easy-to-use platform to make contactless mobile payments. Samsung Pay provides consumers with a new, secure way to pay almost anywhere you can swipe or tap a card – covering millions of merchant locations. This is achieved by combining NFC (near-field communication) with Samsung’s proprietary MST (magnetic secure transmission) technologies. Samsung Pay is compatible with select cards and Samsung devices, and leading providers. MyBroadband has partnered with Samsung to give you a chance to win great prices, including a Samsung Connect and Control Speaker and a Samsung 11,300mAh battery pack. This giveaway will end on Friday, 17 November 2018. This article was published in partnership with Samsung.
