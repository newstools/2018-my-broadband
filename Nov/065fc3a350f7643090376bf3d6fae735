According to data from food delivery service Deliveroo, bicycles are a faster means of getting from point A to B than cars. Forbes reports that Deliveroo, which works with 30,000 drivers in 13 countries, employs a routing algorithm it has named Frank which calculates the fastest route for their riders and drivers. Frank has determined that on average, bicycles are a more efficient means of delivering food than cars. “It makes sense when you think about navigating our towns,” said Deliveroo. “One-way systems, heavy traffic, parks, traffic lights, and tricky terrains are all things that can affect journey times at different times of the day.” However, the company still believes that motor vehicles are better suited to some deliveries, while bicycles are preferred for others. Deliveroo has grown into a multi-billion dollar enterprise thanks to its delivery services, added the company.
