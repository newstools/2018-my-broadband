MyBroadband recently received questions from one if its readers about the difference in MultiChoice’s DStv pricing for businesses and consumers. The reader highlighted that MultiChoice’s DStv Business packages offer much better value than its consumer offerings. MultiChoice currently offers three DStv Business product ranges: Prices for these packages range between R255 per month and R875 per month, depending on the channel selection. The table below shows how the DStv Business Packages compare with DStv Premium, which is the only consumer package which contains all sports channels. MultiChoice told MyBroadband that it does not discriminate on pricing between its DStv consumer and business packages. “We offer different customers different package options at different price points,” MultiChoice said. “The packages offered to residential customers differ from those offered in a business-to-business scenario to hotels and guesthouses.” MultiChoice added that business-to-business package offerings have different requirements to individual subscriptions, which influences how they are priced.
