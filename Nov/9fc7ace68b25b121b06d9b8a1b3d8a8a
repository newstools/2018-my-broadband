The Raspberry Pi Foundation has released a new single-board computer named the Pi 3 Model A+. The foundation said the third-generation version of the Model A+ had been one of its most-requested products, as there had not been a new Model A+ Pi since the first generation of computers. This new Raspberry Pi packs the powerful hardware of the Model 3 B+ into a smaller form factor while retaining the same functionality. DIY enthusiasts and hackers will be pleased to hear that the Pi 3 Model A+ is also priced cheaper than the original Pi 3 Model B+. We have outlined the specifications, features, and pricing of the latest Raspberry Pi board below. While the Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ boasts the same Cortex-A53 processor as the Model 3 B+, it has a much smaller physical footprint. This is mostly due to the removal of ports and some functionality. For example, the new Model A+ does not feature an Ethernet connection â€“ relying on dual-band Wi-Fi network connectivity. It also only has a single USB port present on its PCB, as opposed to the four USB ports boasted on the bigger Pi, and features 512MB of RAM. Below are the specifications of the Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+.  The Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ shares many of its hardware components with the Model 3 B+, and also incorporates a number of improvements made to the mini-computer. These improvements include support for improved USB mass-storage booting, meaning that hackers who want to boot their OS from an external hard drive will now have a much easier time doing so. The small and powerful Pi 3 Model A+ is priced at $25, according to the Raspberry Pi Foundation website. It is now available for order internationally, although the major obstacles for retailers to bring these devices to South Africa could cause the local availability of the device to be delayed significantly.
