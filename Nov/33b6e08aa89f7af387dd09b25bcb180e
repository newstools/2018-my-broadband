Eskom has warned that the risk of nationwide electricity outages continues to increase, Reuters reported. The power utility said the increased risk of load shedding is due to a serious decline in coal stockpiles at a number of its power stations. “The risk of load-shedding is there and its rising,” Eskom told Reuters. “In total, we have 11 coal-fired power stations that have less than the required minimum amount of 20 days stockpile.” “Out of the 11, five of them have less than 10 days of coal stock and that is the challenge,” the power utility added. This follows a recent announcement by Eskom that it would begin cutting management jobs to save on costs. Despite this, the power utility’s costs have continued to increase, which could lead to major increases in the electricity prices for consumers. Eskom has applied to increase electricity tariffs by 15% every year for the next three years, but stated that it is entitled to increased fees by a total of 90%.
