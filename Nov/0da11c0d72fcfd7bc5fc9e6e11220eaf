FNB Connect customers are set to benefit from Cell C’s roaming agreement with MTN, the company announced. In May, Cell C announced it had “entered into a far-reaching roaming agreement with MTN to complement its own high-quality network”. MTN will provide 3G and 4G services to Cell C in areas where Cell C has chosen to purchase coverage rather than self-build – mainly outside of main metro areas. “This agreement will significantly increase coverage, specifically 3G and 4G coverage across South Africa, for our FNB Connect SIMs,” said FNB. The bank added that it currently has over over half a million active SIMs. “As a result of this new roaming agreement expected to be completed by the end of the year, customers will experience an enhanced network quality and faster download speeds. No action is required from our customers as their phones will automatically and seamlessly switch between base stations.”
