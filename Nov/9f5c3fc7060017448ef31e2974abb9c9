Whether you’re a home user or a business, it is important to have reliable, high speed internet. If you live in Cape Town, and are looking to purchase fibre, there’s a clear winner: Faircom. Faircom offers residential and commercial packages, and also has a lot of experience providing fibre solutions to business parks, residential cluster developments, and apartment blocks. As a Faircom customer, you can expect a fast turnaround time, while their network links to the main data centres in South Africa and London – ensuring low latency and high speeds. Additionally, Faircom fibre is unthrottled and unshaped, meaning that you’re getting the best out of your internet connection. Faircom runs on a variety of providers’ infrastructure, including Openserve, Frogfoot, and Octotel. However, they highly recommend using Internect, their own Fibre Infrastructure Provider, due to the significantly cheaper prices available over this carrier-grade network. Internect is an open access network that specialises in connecting apartment blocks and commercial properties, perfect for facilities such as intercoms – providing both security and internet connectivity. Here is one example of how Faircom over Internect provides superior pricing. Clearly, Faircom over Internect provides fantastic value for money, and is the most competitively-priced network in and around the greater Cape Town area. If you’re wondering if you’re living in a block fibred-up by Internect and can benefit from one of Faircom’s affordable packages, simply visit their website and enter the name of your apartment block, e.g. Wembley Square, into the search bar and wait for the pop-up.
