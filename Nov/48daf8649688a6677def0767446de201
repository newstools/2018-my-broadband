Samsung is working on a top-secret model of the Galaxy S10 that will include six cameras, Softpedia News reports. Three Galaxy S10 models are already thought to be in development, but Samsung is reportedly creating another model that has been code named “Beyond X.” This device will allegedly support 5G, and could have a screen size of as much as 6.7 inches. However, the most eye-catching feature is its elaborate camera system. Reports indicate that the device will have four cameras on the back of the device, and another two on the front. This device is expected to release later into next year – a few months after the initial release of the first three Galaxy S10 models. It is initially expected to be released in the USA and South Korea, with other markets possibly getting the device as their 5G capabilities improve.
