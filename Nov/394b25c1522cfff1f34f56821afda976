Scores of Takealot customers have taken to Twitter to state that they cannot pay for their orders on the website. While many users were impressed that Takealot stayed online as it launched its Black Friday 2018 sale – which it calls its Blue Dot sale – once they had filled their carts and headed to checkout, there were issues with payment. Users stated that the website crashed at the payment screen after they had clicked pay, and on certain occasions funds still came off their account. The company was responding to certain users on Twitter to try and help them resolve their issues. “Takealot can confirm that we have had record-breaking orders and visits in the first few hours of Black Friday. Our scaling preparations across all of our platforms ensured that the site remained online and performed well under the extensive initial load,” the company told MyBroadband. “It is however very unfortunate that our credit card payment provider has let us down badly, causing numerous payment issues for some of our customers.” Takealot said it had to intermittently deactivate the credit card payment gateway while its provider restored their service. “The failure to process transactions by the credit card payment provider unfortunately resulted in some of our customers experiencing difficulty completing credit card payments.” “This is unfortunately out of our control.” The company said payments via EFT and other methods remain available. Takealot previously told MyBroadband that it was preparing for massive traffic on Black Friday 2018 to ensure its website can handle the expected spike in activity.
