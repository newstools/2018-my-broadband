WhatsApp has submitted a new beta version of its Android app to the Google Play Beta Program, reported WABetaInfo. Beta version 2.18.335 brings with it a new feature – the ability to reply privately to a contact in a group chat, called Reply Privately. “When you tap reply privately, WhatsApp will automatically open the private chat with the contact,” stated the report. It added that users can also use this feature to privately reply to old messages in a group “where the Send messages feature is on Only administrators”. It further added that the beta version of the app crashes when users try to delete media files in a chat, however.
