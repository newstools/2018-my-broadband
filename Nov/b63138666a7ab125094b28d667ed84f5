The latest additions to the WhatsApp Beta for Android include consecutive voice messages and group call shortcuts, WABetaInfo reports. Both of these updates were delivered to the beta version of the messaging app on 27 November 2018, although they might not be available to all WhatsApp Beta for Android users yet. The new voice messages feature allows users to continuously play voice messages if they are sent directly after each other. This feature will become available when two or more voice messages are detected by WhatsApp, and the app will automatically play all other consecutive voice messages, removing the need to manually play each clip. WhatsApp is also testing its new group call shortcuts in its Android app, which allow users to start a group chat directly by pressing the group call button. After tapping this button, WhatsApp will allow you to select the contacts you wish to call and choose whether to start a video or voice call. These features will be remotely enabled in upcoming WhatsApp Beta for Android updates.
