Samsung has launched its new range of cheap, high-capacity solid state drives (SSDs). The drives were leaked earlier this month via a number of European online retailers, but Samsung’s announcement provides more detail on the specifications of the drives. Samsung’s new 860 QVO SSDs are built on high-density 4-bit multi-level cell (MLC) NAND flash architecture, providing higher storage capacities at better price points than other technologies. “Samsung continues to lead the move toward multi-terabyte SSDs with the introduction of the Samsung 860 QVO, delivering fast performance, reliability and value to more consumers around the world,” Samsung said. The company said the 2.5-inch form factor and SATA interface of the 860 QVO SSDs make them ideal for most laptops and desktops, adding that the high capacities of the drive remove the need to use a combination of SSD and HDD storage in a consumer system. The Samsung 860 QVO SSDs feature 550MB/s and 520MB/s sequential read and write speeds respectively, and will be available in three variants – 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB. Samsung said its 860 QVO SSD line-up will be available from 16 December 2018, with the 1TB model starting at a recommended retail price of $150.
