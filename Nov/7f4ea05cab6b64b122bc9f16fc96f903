Softpedia reports that performance throttling has been added to the iPhone 8 and iPhone X in Apple’s new iOS 12.1 update. This performance management system will be used to lower performance levels if the device is in danger of an unexpected shutdown. “This performance management works by looking at a combination of the device temperature, battery state of charge, and battery impedance,” said Apple. Apple added that performance will only be throttled in order for them not to shut down unexpectedly. Last year’s iPhone models will, according to Apple, use their more advanced hardware and software design to significantly reduce how noticeable this throttling is. Apple introduced the throttling feature after being fined $5.7 million for not informing iPhone 6 owners that iOS 10 would require more energy and may result in these devices shutting down involuntarily.
