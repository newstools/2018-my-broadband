Facebook Messenger for iOS states that the ability to “unsend” messages will be coming soon the application. The patch notes for version 191.0 of the messaging app say that users will soon be able to remove a message from a chat thread after it’s been sent. The unsend option will allow Messenger users to delete sent messages from their own inbox as well as their recipient’s inbox. “If you accidentally send the wrong photo, incorrect information or message the wrong thread, you can easily correct it by removing the message within ten minutes of sending it,” the patch notes state. It should be noted that this ten-minute window to delete a sent message for both yourself and the recipient is a lot shorter than the one-hour period offered by the Facebook-owned WhatsApp. The functionality for this feature was initially spotted last month, hidden in the code for the Android version of the Facebook Messenger app. There is currently no confirmed launch date for the feature on the iOS version of Facebook Messenger.
