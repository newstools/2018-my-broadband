The global tablet market has declined year-over-year for the 16th quarter in a row, indicating that consumers are buying fewer tablets. According to research from the International Data Corporation (IDC), the worldwide tablet market declined 8.6% in the third quarter of 2018, with global shipments falling to 36.4 million. Slate tablets comprise the majority of the market, with detachable tablets shipments accounting for 4.8 million units. “The detachable market has failed to see growth in 2018, a worrying trend that has plagued the category off and on since the end of 2016,” said IDC senior research analyst Lauren Guenveur. The IDC noted that the recent announcement of the refreshed Apple iPad Pro and Microsoft Surface Pro may turn the market around temporarily, but the number and frequency of new products launched by high-end manufacturers continues to decline. Apple easily leads the tablet market with its iPad devices, followed by Samsung and Amazon.
