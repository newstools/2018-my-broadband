Eskom announced that it has implemented stage 2 load-shedding, which calls for 2,000MW to be rotationally loadshed nationally. Stage 2 load-shedding will take place from 09:00-22:00 on 30 November 2018. “Load-shedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout,” Eskom said. “We continue to appeal to residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period.” Eskom customers can check if and when this load-shedding will affect their areas by visiting Eskom’s official load-shedding webpage, or by calling their customer contact centre on 0860 037 566. This follows reports of a massive profit drop at the state-owned power utility, with Eskom’s first-half profit plunging 89% and set to worsen over the next six months.
