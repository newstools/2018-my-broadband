Disney has released its earnings report for the quarter ended 29 September 2018, providing more information on its upcoming streaming platform. The media companyâ€™s online streaming service will be branded as Disney+ and is expected to launch in the second half of 2019. Disney+ will feature a variety of Disney-owned content, from existing shows to exclusive original offerings such as a Thor spin-off centered around Loki, a new High School Musical film, and a prequel to Rogue One. Star Wars: The Clone Wars will also return as an exclusive show on the streaming service, with a new season of the series being launched for the first time in five years. The launch of this streaming platform will also affect the offerings on other streaming services as Disney pulls its content from platforms like Netflix. This means that leading up to the launch of Disney+, Netflix subscribers may lose access to Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel content, including a number of TV series and movies which have become popular on the platform.
