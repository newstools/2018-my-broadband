The ZA Central Registry (ZACR) announced that South Africa’s Internet namespace has passed 1.2 million name registrations across all the Second-Level Domains (SLDs) it administers. These include the “co.za”, “web.za”, “net.za”, and “org.za” SLDs. The ZACR said it has also registered three geographic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) – “.joburg”, “.durban”, and “.capetown”. ZACR CEO Lucky Masilela said the 1.2-million name registration signified the namespace’s impressive popularity. “South Africa‘s SLDs have cemented .ZA‘s standing as one of the world’s most popular namespaces,” Masilela said. The most popular SLD in the namespace – co.za – currently has over 1,117,000 registrations. Masilela said the co.za namespace is highly contested, with many local companies seeking a domain in the namespace. “Every leading local brand has to register a co.za domain name or risk losing valuable IP and cyber real estate to competitors, speculators, or worse,” said Masilela.
