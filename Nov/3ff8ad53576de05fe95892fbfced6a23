The Premier League plans to implement the video assistant referee (VAR) system next season, Engadget reports. The league has acquired approval from its teams, and will now formally ask FIFA and the International Football Association Board for permission to implement the technology. VAR allows referees to ask for video analysis of specific moments to ensure that the right decision is made. Teams previously voted to exclude VAR from the Premier League for the current season. However, due to the system’s success at the 2018 World Cup, Premier League teams have changed their tune. Other top leagues, including Spain, Germany, Italy and France, already use VAR, while UEFA plans to implement the system in its three main competitions – the Champions League, Europa League, and Euros – by 2020.
