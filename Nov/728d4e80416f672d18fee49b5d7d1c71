The State Information Technology Agency (SITA) has announced the launch of South Africa’s new government cloud infrastructure. The agency partnered with Gijima, Huawei, and IBM to launch the government’s private cloud, which it said is one of the largest government clouds in the world. Speaking at the launch of the cloud, SITA CEO Dr Setumo Mohapi said the new government cloud infrastructure is aimed at making life easier for all South Africans. To develop this cloud infrastructure, SITA, Gijima and implementing partners IBM and Huawei re-engineered and modernised SITA’s digital facilities. SITA began the building of its government private cloud ecosystem in 2014, and has already set up in-house cloud sites in KwaZulu-Natal, the Free State, the Western Cape and Gauteng. The agency expects that as more departments begin using the platform, citizens will see a major improvement in government service delivery.
