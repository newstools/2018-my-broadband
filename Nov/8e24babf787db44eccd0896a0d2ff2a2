Black Friday 2018 takes place on 23 November and is the biggest online shopping day of the year in South Africa. Parcelninja CEO Justin Drennan said they expect an increase of 500% in sales on Black Friday this year. Instead of cramming all their sales into a single day, many retailers are running week-long specials next week. Game has gone even further by running a Black Friday Warmup Deals promotion for 10 days – from 14 November to 23 November. The retailer has published the deals today, which include big price cuts on televisions, laptops, and other tech products. The images below show some of the best deals in the Game Black Friday Warmup Deals promotion. For all the Game deals, click here.
