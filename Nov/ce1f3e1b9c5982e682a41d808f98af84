ZTE announced that it has completed a voice call and delivered an Internet and WeChat connection over 5G mobile technology. The international telecommunications company said this success marks a major milestone on the path to 5G commercial use. In April 2018, ZTE demonstrated the first 5G call using the 3GPP R15 global standard. The call was completed with a ZTE smartphone and a ZTE CPE device via a simulation system in its Shanghai R&D Centre at the end of October 2018. The 5G Internet and WeChat connection was provided via the same simulation system. Most 5G smartphones currently support the sub-6GHz frequency band, while ZTE said its solution supports full coverage from below 6GHz to the millimetre-wave frequencies. ZTE is expected to launch its first commercial 5G smartphone within the first half of 2019, after previously announcing it would unveil a 5G smartphone and experimental 5G CPE by the end of 2018. The company said its data testing for its 5G smartphone continues to progress, with additional tests scheduled for December 2018.
