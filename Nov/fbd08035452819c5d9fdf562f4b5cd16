The world’s second-most powerful supercomputer will soon begin operations for the US National Security Administration. Livermore’s Sierra supercomputer comprises over 190,000 processing cores and is capable of a peak performance of 125,626 TFLOP/s. The device also includes a total of 17,280 Nvidia Volta GPUs, with four GPUs per compute node. The United States government is leveraging this impressive processing power to perform simulations of nuclear launches and detonations. “This work on Sierra has important implications for other global and national challenges such as nonproliferation and counterterrorism,” Livermore said. Sierra will be air-gapped for security early next year, following which it will begin to perform the calculations needed to power these complex simulations. The exact nature of the simulations conducted is classified, according the The Verge, which was admitted to report on the facility.
