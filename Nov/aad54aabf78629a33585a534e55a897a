Angola Cables has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Broadband Infraco. “With our international connectivity and reach through our submarine networks and the expansive terrestrial network of Broadband Infraco, there is a genuine opportunity for us to collectively fast-track connectivity on the continent,” said Angola Cables CEO António Nunes. “The very real possibility now exists to connect Brazil and South Africa to the other BRICS nations of Russia, India, and China through a high speed, low latency connection,” added Nunes. Andrew Matseke, CEO of Broadband Infraco, said that the partnership is pivotal in the development of digital connectivity within South Africa and Africa. “Through the Angola Cables subsea networks, SACS, and Monet, Broadband Infraco will have the ability to share international traffic and content.” Broadband Infraco currently has nearly 15,000km of fibre networks across South Africa, while Angola Cables runs a variety of international submarine networks.
