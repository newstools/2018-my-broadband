Update: Telkom has removed the “month-to-month” option from its website. MyBroadband has requested feedback from Telkom on the change. Telkom has unveiled its Big Deal for November 2018, revealing an LTE deal which lets users choose their data allotment and contract type. The deal offers users a 5GB or 10GB monthly LTE data bundle, with the choice of a month-to-month offer or a 24-month contract. Pricing is as follows: The month-to-month version of the deal is a SIM-only package at the prices listed above. If users select a 24-month contract, they will receive a Huawei E5573 LTE MiFi router – along with the data allocations at the prices listed. The MiFi router lets users connect up to 10 devices at once, and features a 1,500mAh battery with 6 hours of usage time. It is important to note that this is Telkom-only data and cannot be used to roam on MTN. The deals are valid until 30 November 2018, or while stocks last. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
