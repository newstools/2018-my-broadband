Netflix has announced on Twitter that it will start releasing its original movies on the big screen before they’re available on the streaming service. ROMA, a new drama set in Mexico, will be the first movie to appear at cinemas before it appears online. Other movies that will likely follow suit include The Ballad of Buster Scruggs and Bird Box. Led by Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuarón, ROMA will release in New York and Los Angeles cinemas from 21 November, according to The Next Web. The movie will only be available on Netflix’s online catalogue on 14 December – nearly a month later. Vanity Fair speculates that the move could be an attempt by Netflix to win Oscars. However, Netflix has previously veered away from film industry norms, making the decision to prioritise cinema showings over their online platform a surprise.
