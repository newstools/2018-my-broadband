Eskom has announced that Stage 1 rotational load-shedding will take place from 12:00 to 22:00 today. The outages are a result of an increase in generation plants being out for both planned maintenance and unplanned outages, according to their website. Eskom customers can check if and when this load-shedding will affect their areas by visiting Eskomâ€™s official load-shedding webpage, or by calling their customer contact centre on 0860 037 566. Eskom said Stage 1 load-shedding requires 1,000MW of power to be saved across the country, and asked customers to switch off geysers and non-essential lighting and appliances. Earlier this month, Eskom warned that the risk of outages was increasing, citing a significant decline in coal at various power stations.
