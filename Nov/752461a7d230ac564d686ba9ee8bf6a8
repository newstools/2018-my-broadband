A breakthrough in spinal-cord stimulation technology has helped three paralysed patients to regain some ability to walk again, Ars Technica reports. David Mzee, whose left leg was paralysed in 2010, has regained some ability to walk again thanks to this technology. “It’s an amazing feeling,” he said. “I can do a knee extension of my left leg… flex my hip and even move my toes.” The new technique to overcome spinal-cord injury, restoring walking ability in patients with varying degrees of paralysis, has helped two other patients recover a degree of walking ability as well. Epidural electrical stimulation (EES) is the basis of the technique, which been investigated for decades as a potential treatment for paralysis. In September this year, two papers reported a breakthrough in EES in helping paralysed patients to walk.
