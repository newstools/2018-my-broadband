OnePlus has announced a launch event for its partnership with British automobile company McLaren. This collaboration could result in upgraded devices with McLaren branding, similar to Huawei’s Porsche Design smartphones. The dedicated page for OnePlus’s McLaren partnership draws parallels between the design philosophy of both companies. The URL for this page ended with “mclaren-6t”, exposing the content of the announcement as a special edition of the OnePlus 6T smartphone. OnePlus has not yet revealed what will separate the McLaren 6T from its standard smartphone, but speculators expect the device to feature upgraded storage or memory and to sport McLaren’s signature orange colour. The OnePlus McLaren 6T launch event will take place on 11 December 2018 at the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking. OnePlus and @McLarenF1. Forever in pursuit of speed. Experience the #SalutetoSpeed on December 11. https://t.co/inqbUCRYcK pic.twitter.com/Q7HGBqmZtw — OnePlus (@oneplus) November 27, 2018
