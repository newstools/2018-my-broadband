Keeping track of which number strings belong to which mobile operators used to be easy, but the growing number of new SIMs and cellphone users means that the amount of numbers in South Africa have increased. MTN still uses the 083 code and Vodacom still uses 082, but the 063, 064, 065, and 066 codes are a bit more complex. These changes have only really affected mobile number codes however, with geographic landline codes remaining constant and easy to remember. 00 remains the international access code, while 01-05 still refer to landlines in specific provincial areas. Number codes in the 06 and above range have become more complex as mobile networks grow and more competitors enter the space, however. There also a number of other services which require number code allocations to function, such as machine-related services and pagers. These generally occupy the higher number code ranges. It is important to note that some number ranges were allocated and divided between mobile operators in ICASAâ€™s numbering plan regulations of 2016. Additionally, customers now have the option to port their numbers between networks, meaning that certain numbers might not be carried by the original network operator. For example, the 084 number range was originally allocated to Cell C, but some numbers might be carried on the Vodacom, MTN, or Telkom network due to customers porting their number. The table below details which number ranges are linked to which operators and areas in South Africa.
