Teraco has said that clients currently making use of its data centres in Cape Town and Johannesburg are set to benefit from the cross connection to the South Atlantic Cable System (SACS) – Africa’s first transAtlantic link connecting Africa to the Americas. SACS reduces latency to the Americas substantially, including a reduction from 338ms to 163ms between Cape Town and Miami. “This is an exciting development and includes much needed investment into local infrastructure,” said Jan Hnizdo, Teraco MD. “Built with a direct purpose to boost business in South Africa, SACS will provide improved connectivity and significantly lower latency routing between Africa and the Americas.” The SACS cable is owned by Angola Cables, whose submarine network is already providing Teraco’s data centres in South Africa with direct connectivity to Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. Angola Cables CEO Antonio Nunes said: “The SACS southern hemisphere, ultra-low latency routings present a massive opportunity for Teraco’s direct clients to access fast and reliable cross connections between Africa and the Americas.”
