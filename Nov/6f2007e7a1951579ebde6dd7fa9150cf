Google Maps could be introducing incident reports, such as alerting drivers to collisions and speed traps, Engadget reports. APK analysis from a few months ago hinted towards such a move, and the recent appearance of this feature on some users’ devices makes its future implementation likely. Users would be able to submit data regarding collisions and speed traps that they encounter while commuting, alerting fellow Maps users to their presence. Google bought popular traffic app Waze in 2013, which led many to predict that Google Maps would implement Waze features such as this one. However, until recently, Google has shied away from doing so. If incident reports were to be implemented in the near future, it would continue Google Maps’ recent move towards introducing more features onto its platform – including the recent rollout of a group planning feature that allows you to organise your events with your friends.
