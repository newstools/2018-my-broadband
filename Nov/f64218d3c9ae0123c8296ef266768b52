Cheaper price plans currently being tested by Netflix may not come to South African users, the company stated. Netflix South Africa told MyBroadband that it is continuously testing new things with the “goal of improving our members’ experience”. The statement follows a report by Bloomberg that Netflix was testing cheaper prices plans with the aim of signing up new subscribers. The company hasn’t committed to lowering prices, but does want to experiment, said CEO Reed Hastings. Locally, Netflix is available at three price points: Basic at R99 per month, Standard at R139, and Premium at R169. “Not everyone will see the test, and we may not ever offer the specific price points or features beyond this test,” said Netflix.
