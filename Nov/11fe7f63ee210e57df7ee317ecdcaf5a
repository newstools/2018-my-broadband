Many Vumatel customers reported disruptions to their fibre connections over the past few days. Afrihost’s network status page has also been littered with announcements regarding Vumatel fibre disruptions. Vumatel told MyBroadband that the issues suffered by several ISPs, which affected clients, over the weekend were mainly due to maintenance performed by a large third-party data centre. While this issue was unrelated to Vumatel’s network, it affected their customers. Vumatel added that ISPs generally refer to these situations as Vumatel issues because it makes the matter easier for customers to understand. Additionally, two switches, one of which is operated by a third-party provider, went down over the weekend. These switches, which service the Savoy and Birch Acres areas, were both fixed within a few hours. Vumatel said it was aware of the issues and sent out relevant communications to the ISPs involved. From midnight until 06:00 on Tuesday, planned maintenance was also executed on the Vumatel network, affecting 15,000 clients. Vumatel said it worked closely with ISPs to ensure that customers would receive minimal disruption, however. This time was used to create a master node in Johannesburg, as well as adding redundancy and capacity to the Vumatel network.
