Telkom has announced a new partnership with Netflix in South Africa. The partnership with Telkom is Netflix’s first such agreement with a South African telecommunications company, said Telkom. Telkom Content Executive Wanda Mkhize said the company is excited to expand its content offering with Netflix, and the partnership allows it to offer more entertainment to users. “As a start, we can respond to customer requests for the inclusion of Netflix on Telkom’s LIT TV Box,” she said. Netflix will be available on Telkom’s LIT TV Box later this year. “We are excited to partner with Telkom and highlight our commitment to South Africa. With this partnership, Telkom users will easily access the most-loved entertainment experiences that Netflix provides,” said Netflix’s VP for Business Development EMEA, Maria Ferreras. Mkhize added that Telkom and Netflix are also working on “exciting mobile and broadband service offerings”. These will be launched before the end of the year, and will include enhanced LIT video options and data offerings. This could see Telkom users receive free Netflix data as part of their Telkom LIT services, which has been Telkom’s plan for some time. This includes LIT Video, which gives users data every month for video streaming from a selection of services, without using their main data bundle. On FreeMe 5GB and up packages, for example, you receive 50GB of LIT Video usage.
