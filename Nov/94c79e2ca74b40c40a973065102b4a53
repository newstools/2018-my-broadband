Vodacom said it has added over 150 new sites to its network to “facilitate additional traffic over the festive season”. “The sites will support the migration of traffic to popular holiday destinations as well as people returning home for festivities around the country,” said Vodacom. A number of temporary sites will also be deployed to accommodate additional voice and data traffic. “Over 250 2G, over 1,800 3G, and over 600 4G upgrades will also be carried out. Vodacom has commenced with various battery upgrades and the provision of backup power facilities for key network sites in the event of electricity outages,” added Vodacom. The company said it has also accelerated its rural coverage expansion programme, which focused on 200 villages this year.
