The latest iteration of the PlayStation 4 Pro has fixed the platform’s infamous noise issues, reports Digital Foundry The CUH-7200 model of the device seemingly uses a new power supply, which has lowered the noise output of the PlayStation 4 Pro. Beyond this, however, it is difficult to spot any significant changes compared to the previous CUH-7100 device. Testing showed that the CUH-7200’s noise levels dropped by 6-7 decibels compared to a release version of the PlayStation 4 Pro. Noise levels dropped from 50dB and 55dB from the top and rear to 44dB and 48dB respectively. Currently, the new version of the PlayStation 4 Pro is only available as part of a Red Dead Redemption 2 bundle, although it is expected to become widely available in the near future.
