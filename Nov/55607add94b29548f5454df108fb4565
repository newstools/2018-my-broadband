Telkom has signed an extensive roaming agreement with Vodacom to roam on its 2G, 3G, and 4G networks in South Africa. This will include seamless handover technology. Telkom stated that the new roaming agreement with Vodacom will start on 1 December 2018. It will then be fully implemented by June 2019. Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub said the company was extremely pleased with Telkom working with Vodacom on the agreement. “By switching its roaming agreement to Vodacom, Telkom will have access to South Africa’s best network with the country’s widest population coverage,” said Vodacom. The agreement is great news for Telkom customers, and potential users who were deciding whether to give the network a go. With roaming on Vodacom’s 3G and 4G network set to be implemented, Telkom data users will benefit from improved coverage and fast data speeds. “We think the roaming agreement is a game changer in the mobile space. It offers our customers improved network coverage and seamless roaming at no additional costs on our mobile packages such as FreeMe,” said Telkom. This makes Telkom’s FreeMe deals arguably the best in South Africa – thanks to a combination of “Telkom prices” and “Vodacom speeds”. “The roaming agreement supports our data-led strategy and ensures that we are able to do this across the country. It allows all Telkom mobile customers to roam on Vodacom’s network in any part of the country,” added Telkom. Telkom’s FreeMe deals are available in a variety of options, including prepaid bundles that provide mobile data, free SMSs, free Telkom minutes, and free data for instant messaging and VoIP usage – such as WhatsApp. The table below shows how Telkom’s FreeMe 1GB, 2GB, 3GB, and 5GB prepaid bundles compare against prepaid data bundles from Vodacom, MTN, and Cell C.
