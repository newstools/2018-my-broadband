With the increasing number of drivers on the road and the rising rate of road accidents, dashcams are becoming a popular accessory for South African drivers. The dashboard-mounted cameras can be powered by a USB charger or connected directly to your carâ€™s electronics, and usually have a few minutes of standalone battery life for when the car is powered off. Dashcams record continuously, overwriting previous recordings in a continuous loop and automatically saving video to an SD card in the case of an accident or other event. Using a built-in G-sensor, dashcams can also sense when an accident occurs and will not overwrite the footage of the accident with further recording. These features make a dashcam an invaluable tool for drivers across the country, especially when it comes to the processing of insurance claims. An important factor to consider when purchasing a dashcam is resolution and recording quality, as this could be crucial in identifying events or objects surrounding an incident. Below are some of the best-rated dashcams you can buy in South Africa right now.
