Cell C has announced that its roaming agreement with MTN has been fully implemented. “Cell C is delighted to announce the completion of the national rollout of MTN roaming, following diligent work from the working teams over the last few months,” said Cell C CEO Jose Dos Santos. “Feedback from the areas that went live with the service early on has been fantastic, and the positive responses from customers around the country continues to come in.” In May, Cell C announced that it had “entered into a far-reaching roaming agreement with MTN to complement its own high-quality network”. The agreement sees MTN providing 3G and 4G services to Cell C in areas where Cell C has chosen to purchase coverage rather than self-build – mainly outside of the metro areas. Cell C customers now have access to “thousands of additional sites”, of which around two thirds are LTE enabled, said Cell C. “Being able to seamlessly handover from our network to MTN’s without noticing the switch has been the biggest benefit of this roaming agreement. Previously, this was not possible when customers entered roaming areas,” added Dos Santos. Cell C’s network service offering is now at 99% 2G population coverage, 96% 3G population coverage, and 80% 4G population.
