The company stated that it showed a profit from continuing operations of R48.4 million for the period – compared to a profit of R18.8 million in the prior period. “Revenue reflected an increase of 5.3% ending the period on R1.2 billion, despite the tough economic conditions,” said the company. As part of the results, the company stated that Openview set-top box activations reached 1.432 million as of September, compared to 1.008 million in the prior period.
