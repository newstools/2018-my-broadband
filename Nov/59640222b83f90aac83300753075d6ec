Razer has released a new package that allows Razer product owners to cover their devices against mechanical and electrical failures. Through the RazerCare Essential product, gamers can cover their laptops for 3 years, or their mobile phones for 2 years. RazerCare will be purchasable alongside Razer product purchases, making the whole process quick and simple. If users sell their devices during the period of their RazerCare Essential coverage, the coverage can be transferred to the new owner for free. Razer products currently offer a one year warranty, which is extended by RazerCare. Some of the other benefits of RazerCare include 24-hour phone support, free 2-way shipping for repairs, and repairs by Razer-authorized centres. RazerCare does not, however, cover damage suffered due to drops, spills, or other accidents.
