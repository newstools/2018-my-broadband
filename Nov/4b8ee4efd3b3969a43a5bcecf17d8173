LG has patented a new smartphone design that includes a screen which covers the entire surface area of the device, Softpedia reports. LG filed the patents with the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), and they were published on 24 October and 2 November. The patents are for two smartphone designs that are virtually identical, except for one of them having a curved screen on the right-hand side of the phone. The design also includes a hole in the screen, which allows for a camera to be housed underneath. Samsung has previously patented a similar device, which also describes a phone with an edge-to-edge display and an under-screen camera. Smartphone device manufacturers have been trying to find the best way to optimise screen size on mobile devices, with the notch presently being the most trendy solution. LG previously confirmed that it is working on a foldable phone, and this new full-screen patent continues the company’s attempts to innovate in the smartphone market.
