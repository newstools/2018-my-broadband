Google has announced its Black Friday deals for the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, reports Engadget. Google will offer a deal where buying two Pixel 3 devices will save you half of the second phoneâ€™s price. Beginning 22 November, Google will be cutting the prices of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL by $150 and $200 respectively. On Cyber Monday, buying a Pixel 3 or 3 XL will earn you a free Home Hub, as well as $50 to spend on the Google Store. The Pixel 3 and 3 XL released last month, so these deals are a great opportunity to snap up the latest Google mobile devices at discounted prices. Google will also be offering a variety of other Black Friday deals, including $50 off the Google Home, and $300 off the Pixelbook.
