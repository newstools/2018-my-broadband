Cloudflare has launched a dedicated mobile app for its 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver service. The 1.1.1.1 DNS service aims to circumvent censorship and improve privacy while offering better latency than other DNS resolvers. While mobile users can manually route their traffic through the DNS resolver by changing their smartphone’s network settings, Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 mobile app aims to make the experience even easier. Instead of changing their network settings for each Wi-Fi connection, iOS and Android users can now download the app instead and toggle a switch to enable the DNS resolver. “We want everyone to have access to faster and more private Internet, and the millions of sites on Cloudflare value the performance boost they get when visited by 1.1.1.1 users,” Cloudflare said. According to DNSPerf data, Cloudflare’s DNS resolver offers the best latency across both Africa and the world. The 1.1.1.1 mobile app is available to download free from the Google Play and App Store.
