MTN had a great presence at the 2018 MyBroadband Conference and Expo in Pretoria. Attendees flocked to their stall to witness some of its unique features. These included a special VR soccer game, where attendees got the opportunity to shoot for goal against an automated goalkeeper powered by 4G and 5G technology. The mobile network giant also hosted a VR demo, where attendees could test out these technologies that are effectively powered by MTN’s high-speed, low-latency internet connections. MTN showcased other technological advances that are being rolled out to the masses, such as their IoT lockers, which the government is implementing. Their point-to-multipoint technology was also launched at the MyBroadband conference. This technology allows SMEs to have a wireless solution at an affordable price that provides top-quality connectivity. MTN won the award for joint network of the year, justifying MTN’s large investment into their infrastructure over the past few years. General manager for MTN Business Llewellyn Ramsagar said that the MyBroadband Conference is a great way for MTN to showcase projects that they are working on that others may not know about. “MTN recognises that the future is co-created,” he added. “There’s great value in partnerships, and it’s only through partnering that we can deliver the vision of a connected future.” Learn more about MTN Business’ enterprise here.
