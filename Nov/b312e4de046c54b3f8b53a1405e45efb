SqwidNet used the MyBroadband Expo to showcase a variety of its products and services. SqwidNet is South Africa’s licensed Sigfox operator and offers low-cost access to IoT solutions and operators. Their network covers over 85% of the population, including 75% of national roads. Sigfox devices communicate with the SqwidNet network from tens of kilometres away, allowing for the implementation of IoT in areas that most networks can’t reach. MD Phathizwe Malinga said that SqwidNet wanted to give people an idea of how easy and simple it is to make your devices “come alive”. Malinga also believes that given South Africa’s economic woes, SqwidNet’s IoT devices offer a great opportunity for prospective entrepreneurs and businesses to access affordable technology. “We are there with technology to help you with fewer resources reach far more people,” said Malinga. Malinga believes that the MyBroadband Conference allows for an unbiased platform for tech companies to showcase their products and services. “We all believe we sell the best product under the sun,” he said, “so it’s good to come to somebody who’s independent who gives us a platform to showcase.” Learn more about SqwidNet’s offerings on their website.
