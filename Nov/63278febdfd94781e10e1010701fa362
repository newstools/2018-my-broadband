Liquid Telecom will expand its long-distance fibre route and metropolitan networks in South Africa, said the company’s group CEO Nic Rudnick. The announcement follows Liquid Telecom’s unveiling of the availability of Microsoft’s Azure and Azure Stack suite of hybrid cloud services across its entire network footprint in Africa. It also follows the company stating in July that it has signed an agreement with Telecom Egypt to complete construction of a terrestrial fibre network from Cape Town to Cairo. Rudnick said that Liquid will continue to build out its fibre network across Africa, which is approaching 70,000km in length. “Of the 15 countries we’re in, we’re going to build in every single one of them,” he said. They will be focusing on builds in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and South Africa. Earlier this year, Liquid Telecom reported that it had over 16,000km of fibre in South Africa – and its focus has been on its national and metro fibre routes, as well as business fibre services. This is set to continue in 2019, said Rudnick. The expansion of Liquid Telecom’s fibre network will help it deliver cloud services more effectively throughout the regions it operates, he added. The five regions where Liquid Telecom will offer Azure hybrid cloud services are South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, and Rwanda. More countries are scheduled to go live during 2019. Clients will also be able to purchase cloud services in their local currencies and only pay for what they use. In addition to expanding its fibre networks, Liquid Telecom will build out its data centre infrastructure. The aim is to increase the capacity of its data centres five-fold over the next five years, it said.
