Apple has released a video outlining why it believes that the new iPad Pro can replace customers’ traditional computers. One of the reasons outlined in the video is that it is “more powerful than most computers”, before showing it being used for gaming and other power-intensive functions. The iPad Pro offers similar performance capabilities to the 2018 MacBook Pro, and is the most powerful iPad ever released. Apple also mentioned the multi-functionality that the iPad Pro provides, including a “camera,” a “cinema,” and an “editing suite.” Thirdly, they highlighted the mobility of the device, as well as its ability to get good signal in relatively poorly-covered areas. They also showcased the ease of use for which Apple devices have become famous – specifically focusing on the simplicity of using the touch screen for navigation. Finally, they touted the bonus functionality that comes with using the Apple Pencil, including creating artwork and signing documents.
