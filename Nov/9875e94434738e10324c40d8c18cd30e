One of the most anticipated events on the business calendar is the Khaliques sale, and it’s back by popular demand! From the 23rd until the 27th of November, everything in store will be on sale at half price. Don’t hesitate to visit any Khaliques store where the latest suits, shirts, shoes, chino’s and jackets as well as denim wear, are available at less 50%. “You’ve asked for it and now it’s here!” said Khaliques. “Get to your nearest Khaliques store and take advantage of 50% off everything.” Khaliques was established as a “Gentleman’s outfitter” in 1940 by Ismail Moosa. Since then, Khaliques has grown from strength to strength, and now has stores in Sandton, Oriental Plaza, Cedar Square, and Mall of Africa. Visit their website to see their incredible Black Friday offers. This article was published in partnership with Khaliques.
