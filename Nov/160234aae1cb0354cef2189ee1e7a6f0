The Sunday Times has reported that deputy president David Mabuza has been in Russia for 3 weeks on sick leave. However, when asked about the sick leave and the medical treatment the deputy president was receiving, Mabuza’s spokesperson said at no time did they state he was ill. “At no point did our statement say the deputy president is ill, but rather [it] says he is on sick leave,” said the spokesperson. “Any costs related to the care of current and former heads of state are in the ambit of the relevant organs of state.” Sources close to Mabuza, though, said he was in Russia for treatment for issues arising from a poisoning incident 3 years ago. Apparently only Russian specialist can help with the resulting health problems. Another source stated that Mabuza does not “trust South African doctors with his life”. President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office would not comment on the matter, stated the report. The Sunday Times added that Mabuza has not appeared in public since 20 October, and that this is the second time he has gone to Russia for medical treatment.
