Pindrop attended the MyBroadband 2018 Conference and Expo, showcasing its unique service to attendees. Their service allows consumers and businesses alike to search for the best internet deals in their area by utilising Pindrop’s open and transparent geo-located marketplace. According to Willie Olivier, managing director at Pindrop, it takes just 30 seconds to discover what internet services are available in your area. You simply need to drop a location pin into their search engine, and Pindrop will tell you which service providers are available, as well as the prices of each of their services. Pindrop works with over 20 of South Africa’s leading connectivity providers, including Cell C, Vodacom, MTN and Liquid Telecom. They work with anyone, from the home user to those looking for business solutions. Pindrop users are provided access to three intuitive dashboards: Project Management and Implementation, Network Monitoring, and Accounts. These allow users to monitor all aspects of their service connection. Pindrop is completely independent, meaning that they’re not going to promote any service provider over another. You can rest assured knowing that you’re truly getting the best deal. Olivier said that the MyBroadband Conference and Expo is a great event. “Year on year, we scale, we grow,” said Olivier. “I can’t wait for next year.” Learn more about Pindrop on their website.
