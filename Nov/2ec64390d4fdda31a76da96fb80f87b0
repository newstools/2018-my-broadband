Always On has partnered with global mobile connectivity provider Pass in an international roaming agreement to deliver cheap uncapped international Wi-Fi connectivity to customers. The service is priced at $20 for a month, which is equal to around R285, said the company. For this price, Always On users will have uncapped Wi-Fi access at over 100 million hotspots in more than 160 countries around the world. “Pass have the world’s largest cloud-based Wi-Fi solution, making them the ideal partner for Always On,” said Internet Solutions Wi-Fi executive business head Emmanuelle Salon. Pass has been operating in wireless technology for 20 years, and its SmartConnect technology enables wireless users to automatically transition between Wi-Fi and cellular. South Africans who purchase this bundle while travelling abroad will receive 30 days of uncapped Wi-Fi access at compatible hotspots. If their stay extends past the bundle validity period, they can top up with additional Wi-Fi data through the Always On app – charged in rand. Frequent travellers could benefit greatly from this offering, as Pass is also deployed in over 24 airlines. If the Always On user is flying in a Wi-Fi-enabled plane and is above 10,000 feet, they can select the appropriate inflight Wi-Fi network from the available network list. This removes the need to create a separate account or sign up with your credit card to access in-flight Wi-Fi. To access this international uncapped Wi-Fi service, users can download the Always On app or Pass app. They can then link their payment details to their account and will be able to sign up for the 30-day international Wi-Fi bundle.
