After the latest Windows 10 update, users may not be able to use the seek bar in Windows Media Player, reports ArsTechnica. Microsoft is aware of the issue, and said it “is working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release”. Additionally, certain users cannot set Win32 tools including Notepad to be the default program for certain file types. While Microsoft said that “trying again” can fix the issue, it is working on a more complete solution – which is expected to be released in the coming days. Windows updates have been riddled with bugs and issues of late. Microsoft had to halt the release of a previous major update due to reported data loss for many users. Since the update was relaunched, it has been blocked for users who run iCloud for Windows 10 due to issues users have faced regarding the syncing of files.
