Thurrott reports that Microsoft will release an Xbox console that doesnâ€™t use discs next year. The device will allegedly serve as a bridging product ahead of the 2020 release of the next-gen Scarlett family of devices. Microsoft will reportedly also introduce a program that allows consumers to turn their physical discs into digital downloads. The point of implementing these devices is supposedly to lower the point of entry into the Xbox market. While the cheapest Xbox One devices cost around $300, this disc-less Xbox device would reportedly retail for under $200. Microsoft is also said to be considering whether its 2020 Scarlett family will have a disc drive. Watch the video below to learn more.
