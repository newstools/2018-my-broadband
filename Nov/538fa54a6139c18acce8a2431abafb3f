Prepaid cellular services company Smartcall announced it has invested R10 million into Mettlestate in an effort drive growth in the South African esports industry. The company said this amount is one of the biggest South African gaming and esports investments to date, and will allow Mettlestate to host competitive gaming leagues consistently over the next few years. “More leagues mean more opportunities for players at all skill levels and across various gaming titles to compete, with more rewards for the amount of time and passion they put into their craft,” said Mettlestate co-founder Barry Louzada. “This investment by Smartcall will allow us to do even more amazing things and drive even more opportunities for gamers in South Africa,” he said. Smartcall marketing manager Jan Cronje said that it would be a wasted opportunity for the company to not get involved in the local esports industry. “We’ve been watching and talking to Mettlestate for quite some time now, and their passion, drive and flawless execution of events and leagues that they host makes us feel comfortable that we’ve put our investment in the right place,” said Cronje. Following this investment, Mettlestate said it would announce new leagues for various games and skill levels over the next few months.
