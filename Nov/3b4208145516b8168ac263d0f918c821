AMD recently launched a new mid-range gaming graphics card, the Radeon RX 590. This GPU is positioned perfectly to take on Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1060 6GB, delivering large amounts of performance at an attractive price point. Both the GeForce GTX 1060 6GB and Radeon RX 590 are powerful graphics card, with at least enough horsepower to run any game at 1080p, and most at 1440p. The Radeon RX 590 is built on AMD’s advanced Polaris architecture which is based on a 12nm manufacturing process, while Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1060 6GB is built on the Pascal graphics architecture. We compared specifications and benchmark data to determine whether the Radeon RX 590 is powerful enough to topple the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB’s impressive value proposition. The Radeon RX 590 and GeForce GTX 1060 feature 8GB and 6GB of GDDR5 video memory respectively. While the Radeon card has more cores and better memory specifications than the Nvidia GPU, the latter is far more power efficient. This is important to note for system builders who need to be careful with their device’s power draw and thermal management. Below are the specifications of the cards. To see how the cards stack up against each other in terms of gaming power, we used data from AnandTech’s benchmark database to compare their FPS performance in games. The Radeon RX 590 and GeForce GTX 1060 6GB are powerful cards, and benchmarks were conducted using Ultra or Very High settings in both 1080p and 1440p. Both cards deliver impressive performance across a selection of modern titles, but on average the AMD card pulls just ahead of the GTX 1060. Below is a comparison of the two graphics cards’ FPS scores in a number of demanding games. The AMD Radeon RX 590 is available in South Africa from local online retailers. Despite outperforming the Nvidia card, the RX 590 starts at a cheaper price than its competitor in South Africa. Below are the two AMD Radeon RX 590 cards currently available in South Africa. Beating the GeForce GTX 1060 in terms of value makes the Radeon RX 590 one of the best-value GPUs you can buy in South Africa – excluding the increased power draw. However, it is the AMD game code bundle which really makes the RX 590 a great buy. All buyers who purchase an AMD Vega or Radeon RX 590 GPU get free digital copies of Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry 5, and Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 with their purchase. This promotion will last until 9 February 2019, according to Wootware’s listing RX 590.
