Point Topic has released its Q3 2018 residential broadband tariff report, which shows that the average and median broadband prices in South Africa are among the highest in the world. Point Topic’s scorecard compares the entry-level, median, and average residential broadband tariffs in 80 countries. To provide an easy way to compare prices, Point Topic has taken the PPP data on entry-level, median, and average broadband tariffs, produced rankings, and then compared the variance. According to the report, Venezuela, Ukraine, and Russia have the most affordable broadband services, while Mauritania, Bolivia, and Oman are the most expensive. South Africa ranks close to the bottom of the scorecard when it comes to the cheapest average and median prices of fixed-broadband products. This means that most South Africans pay higher prices for their ADSL, VDSL, and fibre connections than their counterparts in other countries. South Africa’s average broadband price is also higher than certain African countries, including Egypt, Morocco, and Libya. Some good news is that South Africa has very affordable entry-level broadband prices, where it is ranked in the top 10. Point Topic’s broadband tariff country scorecard is shown below, with the countries at the top of the chart offering the best median tariffs.
