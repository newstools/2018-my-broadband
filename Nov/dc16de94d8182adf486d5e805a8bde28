Telkom recently unveiled its Big Deal for November 2018 – a 5GB or 10GB LTE deal. When the deal was published on Telkom’s website on the morning of 1 November, it offered users the choice of a month-to-month package or a 24-month contract. Pricing was: The month-to-month version of the deal was a SIM-only package, while a 24-month contract included the data SIM and a Huawei E5573 LTE MiFi router. When customers tried to purchase the month-to-month deal, however, they were told by Telkom staff it was not available. After receiving complaints that the package was not available, MyBroadband visited Telkom’s website later that day. It was found the reference to the month-to-month option on the Telkom Big Deal for November page had been removed. MyBroadband contacted Telkom for feedback on the matter, and has now received feedback. Telkom stated that the month-to-month option was a mistake that was made on the website. “The November deal on all other mediums – in-store materials, print, etc. – is on the 24-month contract,” said Telkom. “We have honoured the offer for those who applied while it was on the website, and have corrected it to be consistent with all other mediums.”
