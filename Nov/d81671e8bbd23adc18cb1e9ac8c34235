Rain fixed-LTE packages are off the menu from today, following a decision by the company to suspend sales due to network capacity constraints. Rain announced in July that it will suspend the sale of its fixed-LTE products through partner ISPs from 1 November. Following this, it stated that active users on the network will receive free off-peak data from 1 December 2018. Subscribers will receive off-peak data from 23:00 to 18:00 – a period of 19 hours – each day, on top of their anytime data allocation. With Rain no longer offering fixed-LTE packages, this leaves users with fewer choices for connectivity. The two big players now are Cell C through local ISPs and Telkom with its fixed-LTE packages. MTN also offers users fixed-LTE services, but these are subject to tower-locking. The coverage and speeds offered by the various providers vary depending on your location and the number of users in your area using the same service – factors which must be taken into account when deciding on a package. Unlike fibre and ADSL which promise users a certain download and upload speed on their line, fixed-LTE performance can vary greatly in terms of latency and speeds. Users are encouraged to test a service provider with a cheap prepaid SIM and data bundle, or ask a friend with a fixed-LTE package if they can trial their service for a day. To compare the LTE packages on offer in the market after Rain’s departure, we have listed deals below from MTN, Cell C, and Telkom.
