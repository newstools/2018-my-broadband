Pick n Pay has revealed all of its deals for its Black Friday 2018 sale, offering specials through its physical branches and its online store. The retailer said that all of its stores will open at 06:59 on Black Friday and its online deals will go live at 00:01. Pick n Pay’s online shop will also offer selected online-only deals. Black Friday deals recently launched in Pick n Pay Hypermarkets across the country, offering discounts on items such as televisions, fridges and many more. Pick n Pay head of marketing John Bradshaw said that the retailer is ready to host its biggest Black Friday ever, stating that customers can expect discounts of up to 60% across many categories, including appliances, tech, liquor, food, toiletries, household products and clothing. “As Black Friday is one of the busiest shopping days, we are anticipating more customers so we have also increased our support team to make this Black Friday the most memorable yet,” Bradshaw said. “In-store, we will have additional staff helping on the floor to move and unpack products and assist customers with their purchases, even pushing a customer’s trolley to their car.” “We have also increased our staffing complement to process online orders and have added additional delivery and collections slots so that customers can enjoy their purchases as soon as possible,” he said. Pick n Pay’s Black Friday catalogues are broken down into regions, and all catalogues can be viewed on the Pick n Pay website.
