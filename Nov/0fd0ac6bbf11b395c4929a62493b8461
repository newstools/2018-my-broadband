Samsung has confirmed that its upcoming smartphones will feature notch cut-outs on their displays, The Verge reports. Speaking at the company’s developer conference this week, Samsung product marketing director Hassan Anjum said that Samsung would make use of a notch display design to shrink bezels even further. “We’re going to keep going. The bezels are going to shrink even further,” he said. Samsung outlined its roadmap for its new display designs, which begins with a modern display design with a small notch at the top. The company also plans to implement a standalone circular cutout for the front-facing camera in a future display design, before phasing out the notch and resorting to a full-screen panel. The roadmap is quite ironic considering Samsung’s series of videos poking fun at Apple about its lack of a headphone jack and notched display design. Samsung also showed off its new foldable smartphone at the same event.
