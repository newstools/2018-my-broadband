Popular money management app 22seven has introduced the ability to link and track over 1,800 cryptocurrencies in rand values. 22seven managing director Jikku Joseph says the popularity and growing interest in cryptocurrencies made the update inevitable. “South Africans are increasingly exposed to cryptocurrencies and are starting to warm up to the possibilities of the blockchain,” said Joseph. Joseph added that having a view of their cryptocurrency holdings in rand values would give users a more complete picture of their money. “Information is power and diversifying your portfolio is a wise choice,” he said. “22seven allows you to keep track of your diversified holdings across multiple asset classes and financial providers.” Interest in cryptocurrency remains strong, with the 2018 Old Mutual Savings & Investment Monitor finding that 56% of households which earn over R40,000 are aware of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
