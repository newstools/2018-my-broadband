Vodacom recently released its interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2018, which show that the mobile operator is still growing well. The group added a total of 4.8 million customers in the six-month period, increasing its global subscriber numbers by 10.7%. This contrasts with MTN’s recent quarterly update, where it showed that it had begun losing subscribers in South Africa. Vodacom’s service revenue in South Africa also increased by 4.6% to R27.9 billion – despite the country’s economic slowdown. The mobile operator has invested R4 billion in South Africa over the last six months and continues to improve its rural coverage. Vodacom’s interim results showed that the company had a total of 44.1 million customers in South Africa, comprised of 38.6 million prepaid and 5.5 million contract customers. MTN’s latest quarterly update reflected that it had a local mobile subscriber base of 26.6 million customers. Cell C’s latest financial results reflect 16.3 million South African customers. The company’s latest results did not reflect postpaid and prepaid subscriber counts. Telkom’s interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2018 showed that it had a total of 6.5 million subscribers.
