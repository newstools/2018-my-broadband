The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa), Cosatu, and other organisations are marching to the government on Friday with a simple message – the e-toll scheme needs to be stopped once and for all. The march will start at Burgers Park in Thabo Sehume and Jacob Mare streets in Pretoria Central at 9:00 and heads to the Union Buildings. “It is grossly unfair of the government to expect the users of 1% of Sanral’s road network to contribute 34% of Sanral’s revenue,” said Outa CEO Wayne Duvenage. Duvenage said the civil disobedience campaign against the “user abuser e-toll scheme” has now pushed the compliance rate to below 25%. “This makes this electronic tolling scheme the most inefficient in the world, with more than 90% of revenue collected going to administration costs and virtually nothing toward the tarmac,” Duvenage said. Outa said it will march to the Union Buildings “in solidarity with others who share our call on government to end this grossly irrational and inefficient scheme”.
