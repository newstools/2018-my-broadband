It is harmonising its pricing for “out of bundle, once-off bundles, and recurring bundles across all voice, data, and SMS pricing plans”. “This will help standardise the prices of these bundle rates for customers whether they are on Prepaid, Top Up, or Post Paid and simplify the price structure in the bank’s mobile offering,” said Palmer. “The review is aligned with FNB Connect’s ongoing business strategy to ensure that its offerings provide superior value for money, increased customer satisfaction and legislative compliance while meeting industry standards. The revised prices remain competitive and customers may receive the added benefit of earning up to 15% back in eBucks on their FNB Connect purchases.” “We remain committed to providing customers with added convenience that ensures customer satisfaction and lessens customer angst.”
