Samsung has announced that it will launch support for compatible Samsung smartwatches on its Samsung Pay platform. Speaking at a media briefing in Johannesburg, Samsung Pay Project Lead Philip Henning said that Samsung Pay users will be able to pay for purchases with their Samsung smartwatch in the near future. “We will launch this new feature very shortly,” Henning said. This added support for wearable payments follows a recent overhaul of the Samsung Pay application and its user interface. Paying with a Samsung smartwatch only supports NFC technology, meaning you will be unable to pay at POS terminals which do not support contactless payments. The following Samsung wearables will be supported on the Samsung Pay platform: To use Samsung Pay on their smartwatch, users do not need to connect their wearable to their smartphone – as they can start up Samsung Pay on their watch by holding the back button for one-and-a-half seconds. After the Samsung Pay app appears, smartwatch users can select their card to complete their purchase. As an additional security measure, the Samsung Pay app on the smartwatch will request the user to enter a PIN if it detects that contact has been broken between the watch and the wearer’s body. Henning added that Samsung Pay’s redesigned user interface offers improved accessibility, adding dedicated Pay and Home buttons in addition to changing the orientation of the virtual card within the app from vertical to horizontal. He also said that Samsung’s negotiations with South African banks were progressing, and that support for more banks would be added to the application soon. Samsung Pay now also supports in-app payments, he added. This allows users to make and verify online purchases directly from the Samsung Pay app, although this functionality is exclusive to purchases from the Galaxy App Store for now.
