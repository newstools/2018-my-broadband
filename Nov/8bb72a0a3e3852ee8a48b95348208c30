South Africa’s national, provincial, and local governments wasted R296 billion in unauthorised, irregular, and fruitless and wasteful expenditure in the past five years. This is according to a report in the City Press, which said Auditor General Kimi Makwetu’s reports for government departments show gross mismanagement of public funds. Some of the findings in the Auditor General’s latest audit reports for national and provincial government include: Makwetu told government bosses that this gross mismanagement of public funds is unacceptable, and that it needs to change. “A culture of no consequences has been created through the leadership’s involvement in the decision making that led to transgressions,” he is quoted as saying by the City Press. “The continued disregard for procurement processes by the leadership that resulted in irregular expenditure, coupled with limited consequences for the transgressions, created an environment vulnerable to misappropriation, wastage and the abuse of state funds.” Key highlights of the Auditor-General’s annual report on government departments and state-owned companies include: National and provincial government departments are now facing an increased risk of litigation, with almost a third of them facing claims exceeding 10% of their next year’s budgets. The Auditor General’s annual audit report showed that the country’s government entities have racked up a wasteful and irregular expenditure bill exceeding R51 billion. This figure, however, doesn’t include South Africa’s two biggest money wasters – Eskom and Transnet. These two state-owned enterprises had their auditing done by private firms and have amassed a combined R28 billion in wasteful and irregular expenditure.
