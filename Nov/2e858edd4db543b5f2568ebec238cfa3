Scientists researching climate change in South African have found evidence of it affecting fish and plants in the ocean. According to a report by the Sunday Times, many plant and fish species are listed in a department of agriculture, forestry and fisheries climate-change adaptation and mitigation plan. The department said there is a lot of evidence which shows that species are moving based on rising temperatures, which is likely due to climate change. The report lists several key changes, including: Most of the changes have been directly and indirectly linked to ocean temperature increases. The department said it has developed a vulnerability index in response, where it will rate fish on how vulnerable they are. The report follows recent statements from a study in Nature which showed that Bitcoin mining could increase global temperatures by as much as two degrees Celsius by 2033. It said further that this could happen if Bitcoin is adopted at similar rates to other innovations such as the credit card.
