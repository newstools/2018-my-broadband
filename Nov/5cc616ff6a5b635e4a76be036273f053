The official G Suite Twitter account has been hacked to scam social media users with promises of Bitcoin. The Google-owned account recently tweeted that the company was giving away 10,000 Bitcoin to its community. G Suite’s tweet included a link to a scam website which asked participants to send between 0.1 and 2 Bitcoin to an address, promising to send them between 1 and 20 units of the cryptocurrency in return. The Google G Suite account had over 800,000 followers when it published the tweet. Hackers promoted the fake tweets so that they would appear to more Twitter users, and the fact that the tweet originated from the verified G Suite account may have greatly improved the scam’s effectiveness. This follows a number of similar scams which originated from hacked verified accounts, including major US retailer Target. Google has not yet issued a statement regarding how its G Suite Twitter account was compromised.
