Elon Musk believes that the chance of him moving to Mars is now around 70%, according to an interview for the Axios on HBO documentary series. The SpaceX CEO said that a recent number of breakthroughs have drastically increased the chance of himself and others travelling to the red planet in the near future. When asked if moving to Mars would be an “escape hatch for the rich”, Musk said that the possibility of dying on another planet would be far higher than on Earth. He likened the expedition to journeying to the South Pole, as even once humans arrive on Mars they would spend all their time building habitats and struggling to survive. Living on Mars would be about the challenge, as there is no guarantee of returning to Earth or even arriving safely on the surface of the planet, Musk said.
