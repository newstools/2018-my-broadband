The salary review provides a “true representation of cost-to-company salary packages in South Africa”, said CareerJunction. It added that the information is based on “up-to-date salary information using actual salary offerings on our website for the latest measurable period – May to November 2018”. Sectors covered in the report include engineering, IT, marketing, finance, manufacturing, medical, construction, sales, and more. The report further details the salary differences between regions – KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng, and the Western Cape – per sector, with Gauteng regularly offering higher salaries than the other regions. To find out which jobs offer the highest salaries in South Africa, based on CareerJunction’s figures, we took top-paying jobs from each of the covered sectors and listed them in the table below. Certain sectors have more positions listed than others, due to the fact that multiple jobs in that sector offer high salaries in comparison to all the positions listed. Positions are their sector along with their “intermediate” and “senior” salary ranges are listed. Sectors which played host to several high-earning jobs were finance, construction and engineering, and IT. The top-paying job, based on the top end of the senior salary range, was financial management – reaching R79,002 per month.
