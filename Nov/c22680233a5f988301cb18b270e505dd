Netgear has released its first two Wi-Fi 6 routers – the Nighthawk AX8 and Nighthawk AX12 – with an eye-catching design. This new design includes two “wings” which keep the routers’ antennas upright – ensuring optimal performance. The AX8 is powered by a 64-bit 1.8GHz quad-core processor, and allows for total speeds of up to 6Gbps. It offers 160MHz channel support – double the speed of 80MHz channels, providing superior speeds to compatible devices. The AX8 also includes 6 individual gigabit Ethernet ports, allowing for more wired devices to access the router. The AX12, meanwhile, boasts a superior 2.2GHz processor, as well as 5Gb and 2.5Gb Ethernet ports. Both routers offer MU-MIMO, and 5GHz and 2.4GHz bands. Wi-Fi 6 uses the next-generation 802.11ax standard, and will include benefits such as faster data rates, more capacity, and improved power efficiency.
