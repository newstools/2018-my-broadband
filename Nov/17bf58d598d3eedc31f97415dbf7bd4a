Frogfoot recently announced that it was expanding its fibre network in the Western Cape, with plans to connect 14,000 more homes in the Southern Peninsula. Frogfoot, which is a subsidiary of Vox, said its open-access network will bring fibre to these homes by April 2019. The move follows the company passing 30,000 homes since it started an “aggressive FTTH expansion programme” in 2016. Shane Chorley, head of sales at Frogfoot, told MyBroadband that of the 30,000 homes it has passed, it has connected over 7,000 customers. “We have a healthy pipeline of homes to still connect,” said Chorley. Frogfoot also stated that it aims to connect 150,000 homes nationally by the end of 2019. Chorley said this expansion will take place across South Africa, and as they move through the planned areas they will release updates to ISPs and residents. Frogfoot currently offers fibre line speeds ranging from 10Mbps all the way up to 1Gbps, with a range of ISPs offering packages on the network While lines speeds of 100Mbps – and 1Gbps for power users – are an attractive option, Chorley said that the most popular line speeds that users take are between 20Mbps to 50Mbps. The reasons for this may be that popular protocols and services, such as online gaming, Netflix and YouTube streaming, and file downloads all work very well at speeds of between 10Mbps to 20Mbps. The good experience with these services in combination with higher prices for faster speeds means users may not see taking a 100Mbps line or faster as necessary.
