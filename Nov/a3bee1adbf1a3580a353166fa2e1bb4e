Marvel announced today that legendary writer Stan Lee has died at the age of 95. According to a report by TMZ, Lee was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center early on Monday morning, where he passed away. Lee began working in the comics industry in 1939, but made a name for himself in 1960 when he worked on iconic titles including the Fantastic Four, X-Men, Daredevil, Thor, and Spider-Man. While he stopped writing comics in 1972, Lee continued to serve in a publisher role at Marvel. More recently, he made numerous cameo appearances in Marvel movies released over the last two decades. “Stan Lee was as extraordinary as the characters he created,” said Disney CEO Bob Iger.  “A superhero in his own right to Marvel fans around the world, Stan had the power to inspire, to entertain, and to connect.”
