The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) has published a notice of intention to conduct an inquiry into mobile broadband services. ICASA said the inquiry would be conducted in terms of section 4B of the ICASA Act in addition to section 67 of the Electronics Communications Act. This decision follows an investigation by the regulator into the telecommunications sector to identify priority markets which may be in need of improved regulations. ICASA said that within this inquiry, it will assess the state of competition and determine whether there are any market segments in the mobile broadband services sector which may require additional regulation. Specifically, the regulator will determine whether any further regulation outlined in the Electronics Communications Act should be imposed within this sector. ICASA said it aims to finalise this inquiry in the 2019/2020 financial year.
