Google has announced it is optimising Android to account for a new form factor – foldable smartphones. The company is enhancing its Android operating system to support foldable displays, combining interface changes with the operating system’s existing screen continuity feature. Screen continuity is an API used by Android apps to detect when the screen has changed in size or rotated and adjust their interface accordingly. Support for foldable smartphone displays can be added to this API, leaving it up to developers to ensure that their applications properly implement this feature. This follows Samsung’s recent unveiling of its first smartphone with an InfinityFlex foldable display. “Expect to see foldables coming from several Android manufacturers, including one Samsung previewed today and plans to offer next year,” Google said.
