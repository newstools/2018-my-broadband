Dropbox has partnered with the likes of Adobe and Vimeo to release a variety of third-party software plugins to its in-app and in-browser cloud storage service, The Verge reports. The new functionality, called Extensions, will allow users to perform simple tasks, including digitally signing PDFs as well as basic photo editing. Dropbox is trying to reduce the number of apps and tabs users need to have open at one time by integrating basic services into their digital platform. Files will have an “open with” option, similar to those present on Windows and macOS, where users will be able to choose which app to open a file with. Previously, Dropbox tried to develop its own software for this purpose, including the defunct Mailbox app, as well as the still-active writing and editing software Paper. Extensions signals a change of approach from Dropbox, as they have now partnered with big companies. Extensions releases on 27 November.
