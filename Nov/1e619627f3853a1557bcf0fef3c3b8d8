Liquid Telecom has extended the availability of Microsoft Azure across its entire network footprint in Africa. Hybrid cloud services from Microsoft’s Azure and Azure Stack suite will be available through Liquid Telecom’s five data centres on the continent, along with Liquid’s CloudConnect service for Microsoft ExpressRoute. These services will be connected over its network across Africa, which is approaching 70,000km of fibre, said the company. The five regions where Liquid Telecom will offer Azure hybrid cloud services are South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, and Rwanda. More countries are scheduled to go live during 2019. Clients will also be able to purchase cloud services in their local currencies and only pay for what they use. “By extending the reach of Microsoft Azure to an increasing number of countries and customers, Liquid Telecom is helping Africa realise its digital future,” said Nic Rudnick, group CEO of Liquid Telecom.
