Delivering powerful and scalable services is a key part of Vodacom’s enterprise cloud offering, and security is at the foundation of the company’s products. Vodacom managing executive for business solutions Chris Lazarus said that security is a key consideration for all offerings, and Vodacom constantly inspects its resilience to potential threats and service interruptions to ensure it operates within a cutting-edge, secure environment. “If we talk about systems crashing in a cloud environment, that is something we consider way before we think about inviting a customer to consider us.” “Vodacom itself is a large organisation, and before we can think about selling services to our enterprise customers, we have to think about how to protect the organisation with its tens of millions of customers,” Lazarus said. He added that Vodacom takes everything from data redundancy to physical proximity into account when designing its data centre ecosystems. “When we design these facilities, it is not singular in nature,” Lazarus said. “If we take the Vodacom context, we have seven data centre environments that we have built, both for where we provide customers’ capabilities and for Vodacom’s operations.” The security behind Vodacom’s cloud offering ensures that critical services are extremely well-protected from a variety of threats, including physical and remote attacks. “We think about risk in terms of downtime and uptime, we think about disaster recoveries, and we have risk and compliance to meet,” Lazarus said. “So, we have to think about where we build the next facility in terms of proximity to others.” Lazarus explains that with large organisations, there are far more points of entry for potential attackers, and companies offering IT services should ensure that all their data is protected with every eventuality considered. Vodacom Business is a major provider of cloud-based IT services for large companies, and its security is designed to provide stability and reassurance to its clients while maintaining a highly-efficient and scalable environment for them to operate within. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> This article was published in partnership with Vodacom EBU.
