Cell C fixed-LTE customers have been hit by slow download speeds in recent weeks, according to feedback from users. A MyBroadband reader who is a Cell C fixed-LTE customer stated that he battles to get above 2-4Mbps on weekday evenings between 18:00 to 23:00. What concerned him is that on the weekends he is able to receive download speeds of 20-30Mbps, and during the week when download speeds are slow he still receives upload speeds of over 10Mbps. The users stated he is on a 100GB package and uses a Huawei B315 router, and lives in Grassy Park, Cape Town. MyBroadband forum members who are Cell C fixed-LTE users have also complained of slow download speeds in recent weeks. “My downstream throughput is between 3-6Mbps, and the upstream between 5-10Mbps,” said one user. Another user stated their package was running well until August, when they started seeing very slow international download speeds. A user with a Huawei B618 router stated they were receiving good download speeds – 35Mbps – but in September download speeds “struggled” to reach 10Mbps. Complaints continued into October and November, in a similar vein to the “slow downloads” issues listed above – with certain users stating their connections were “unusable”. It must be noted that the users who complained have purchased their Cell C fixed-LTE accounts through various ISPs. MyBroadband contacted Cell C about the reports, and it stated there have been no major changes to the network in Grassy Park, barring a “link issue which was resolved a few weeks ago”. It did not provide feedback on the multiple complaints listed by forum members.
