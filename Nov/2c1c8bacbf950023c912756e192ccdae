Researchers at MIT have constructed and flown the world’s first-ever aircraft with no moving parts. Instead of using conventional propulsion methods such as propellers, turbine blades, or fans, MIT’s aircraft is powered by ionic wind. This stream of ions is generated aboard the aircraft and produces enough thrust to propel the plane over sustained, steady flight. Another advantage of the propulsion system is that it is completely silent, making it potentially ideal for implementation in urban areas. “This is the first-ever sustained flight of a plane with no moving parts in the propulsion system,” said MIT associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics Steven Barrett. “This has potentially opened new and unexplored possibilities for aircraft which are quieter, mechanically simpler, and do not emit combustion emissions,” Barrett said.
