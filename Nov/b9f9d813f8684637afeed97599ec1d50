Microsoft has surpassed a struggling Apple to become the most valuable company in the world, Softpedia reports. Microsoft is worth $753 billion, while Apple’s value is now $746 billion. Earlier this year, Apple became the first company to become worth more than a trillion dollars, but has since plummeted in value. Apple’s share price has fallen by 20% since the beginning of October due to less demand for their new iPhone X range than expected. This is due in part to the company’s extreme pricing structure, with the top-of-the-range iPhone XS Max 512GB device costing R31,999. Microsoft, on the other hand, has seen its investments in cloud services and Office 365 pay off. Thanks to these and other profitable investments, Microsoft looks poised to continue growing.
