Pick n Pay has launched its Black Friday 2018 deals at hypermarkets across the country, offering discounts of up to 60% on products. The sale will run from 21-25 November. The full catalogue is available here. “We’ve worked closely with our suppliers to negotiate lower prices and extra stock so that we can offer our customers the best deals over a few days and not just Black Friday,” Pick n Pay head of marketing John Bradshaw said. The store said customers should do their shopping early as some of the deals have limited units available, and Pick n Pay has limited some of the deals to a specific number per customer. Pick n Pay will launch additional deals on Black Friday. All Pick n Pay stores will also open at 06:59 on 23 November, and its online store will launch a three-day Black Friday sale at midnight.
