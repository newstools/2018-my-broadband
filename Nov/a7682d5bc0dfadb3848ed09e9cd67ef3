Game has detailed its Black Friday 2018 deals in an online brochure, with a wide range of items on offer at discounted prices. The deals will be available for one day only on 23 November. Game did state, however, that it will have a “Black Friday extended deals” sale from 23-25 November and customers should look out for the deals which are marked as being available for the three days. Deals on Black Friday will be a “while stocks last” offer, it added. For those shopping in-store at a Game outlet, there will be a number of stores which will open at 23:59:59 on Thursday – as Black Friday officially starts. A selection of tech deals from the Game Black Friday 2018 sale are listed below.
