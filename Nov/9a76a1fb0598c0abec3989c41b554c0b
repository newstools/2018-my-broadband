AMD has revealed its new Radeon Instinct GPUs, which are the first 7nm dedicated GPUs in the world. The Radeon Instinct MI60 and MI50 GPUs aim to deliver next-generation compute performance for artificial intelligence and cloud computing applications. AMD said its new Instinct cards will be used by researchers and developers to solve tough challenges, including large-scale simulations, climate change, computational biology, and disease prevention. The GPUs were designed to efficiently process neural network workloads, delivering higher levels of floating point performance than previous generations. AMD’s Radeon Instinct MI60 and MI50 use HBM2 memory with up to 1TB/s memory bandwidth and are the first GPUs to support PCIe 4.0 interconnect. The company also announced a new version of its ROCm open software platform, which is designed to speed up development of high-performance computer systems. AMD’s Radeon Instinct MI60 will begin shipping to customers at the end of 2018, and the Instinct MI50 will become available a the end of Q1 2019.
