Cyber Monday 2018 kicks off on 26 November and offers online-focused deals for one day only. Cyber Monday is the first Monday after Black Friday and was established to encourage people to shop online. With many modern retailers offering comprehensive online shopping services, however, it is now seen as the day which marks the end of the Black Friday shopping weekend. While stores will launch specific Cyber Monday deals, many companies decide to rather run their Black Friday sales into Monday â€“ essentially combining the two sale days into one big batch of specials. Many stores are running Cyber Monday specials in South Africa, with some of the best deals listed below.                               Please note that certain deals may only be available on 26 November.
