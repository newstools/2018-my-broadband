China’s state-run press agency, Xinhua, has launched its new AI news anchors. These anchors are digital composites which read the news in a synthetic voice and are recreated from footage of real human anchors. The mouth and face of the AI anchors are edited to improve the authenticity of the production, and the anchors can programmed to read the news far quicker than using traditional methods. Xinhau created two AI anchors in partnership with Chinese search giant Sogou, one for English broadcasts and another for its Chinese audience. The news agency told the South China Morning Post that its AI anchors could greatly improve efficiency and lower the cost of producing daily news reports. “AI anchors have officially become members of the Xinhua News Agency reporting team,” Xinhua said. “They will work with other anchors to bring you authoritative, timely and accurate news information in both Chinese and English.” Watch a sample report by Xinhau’s English AI virtual anchor below.
