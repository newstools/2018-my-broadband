Takealot announced that it has seen a record number of visitors to its website on Black Friday 2018. The retailer’s “Blue Dot” sale went live at midnight and generated more than R11.5 million worth of transactions in the first hour. Black Friday sales surpassed the R87-million mark by 08:30, out-earning the total sales generated by Takealot on Black Friday 2017. The initial bestseller of the Takealot Black Friday 2018 sale was Tommy Hilfiger For Her perfume, followed by the DStv Explora decoder and Pampers nappies. Takealot said that in terms of highest-value items sold, four out of the top five best sellers were smart TVs and gaming consoles. Takealot chief marketing officer Julie-Anne Walsh said that the website is performing well thanks to the extensive preparations made by the company. “Thousands of Blue Dot Sale deals are still available for shoppers to take advantage of over the entire Blue Dot Sale weekend,” she said. Intermittent issues with Takealot’s credit card payment provider resulted in some problems with processing orders, and Takealot said it will deactivate its credit card payment gateway until its services are fully restored. The retailer encourage buyers to use alternative payment methods such as iPay and Payfast. Takealot’s Blue Dot Sale will continue throughout the weekend and will end at midnight on 27 November, including Cyber Monday and Takealot Tuesday specials.
