Black Friday has become the biggest online shopping day in South Africa, with most ecommerce players offering price cuts on their products. Black Friday is an American tradition where the day after Thanksgiving – the fourth Thursday of November – is seen as the start of the Christmas shopping season. South Africa has adopted this tradition, and over the last few years most large retailers started to offer big specials on Black Friday. This year there is a trend where many stores are offering deals for the whole weekend – from 23-25 November – and not just on the day. Makro has gone even further by offering its Black Friday deals from Wednesday 21 November to Sunday 25 November. Here are the prominent South African retailers which are offering Black Friday specials this year. Please note that some of these deals may only become available on Friday 23 November.
