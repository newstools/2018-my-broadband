Transnet has served summons on Gupta-linked companies Trillian Asset Management and its subsidiary Trillian Financial Advisory, according to a report in the City Press. MNS Attorneys served the summons to the two companies on behalf of the state-owned enterprise, in addition to issuing fresh summons to former Transnet CFO Anoj Singh and another four former executives. Transnet has demanded that Trillian pay R93.5 million for work it paid the company for which it said was performed by another Gupta-linked company named Regiments Capital. The second claim against Trillian demands that it repay R41 million which was paid to the company in error. According to the claim, Trillian Advisory submitted a proposal to now-suspended Transnet engineering head Thamsanqa Jiyane, offering to “undertake financial structuring advisory services in order to assist Transnet Engineering… with the fundraising required to facilitate its African and global sales of rolling stock”. Transnet said this proposal was unsolicited and did not form part of the original acquisition deal for 1,064 locomotives. The company alleges that Trillian did not complete any work for this money, and that two of its former executives which it has also issued with summons authorised the payment. This follows Transnet sending its first wave of subpoenas to its former executives earlier this month, demanding they pay back money they received for inflating the cost of a tender and awarding it to Gupta-linked companies. The company demanded that its former executives and Regiments Capital pay back the sum of R189 million, and also sought interest to be paid on the total amount owed.
