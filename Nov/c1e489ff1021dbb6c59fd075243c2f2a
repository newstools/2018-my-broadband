Superbalist has launched its new Click and Collect service for online shoppers, allowing customers to pick up their deliveries from designated points. Customers can use the service by choosing the “Collection” option when they check out using the Superbalist website or app. Buyers are then sent a PIN code via email, which they will use to unlock their chosen Takealot Pickup point and collect their package. Customers can collect their package within seven days of delivery, and Superbalist said orders usually arrive within 2-4 days of purchase. “In addition to home and business delivery, shoppers can now choose to have their order delivered to one of more than 20 Takealot Pickup Points across 6 provinces,” said Superbalist CEO Luke Jedeikin. “You can now pick up orders whilst you’re on your way home from work, out and about or simply when it’s most convenient for you.” Pickup Points are open seven days a week, from 10:00 – 19:00 on weekdays and 11:00 – 17:00 on weekends. Superbalist said that customers who order through Click and Collect before 18 December 2018 will be automatically entered into a competition to win a R10,000 shopping voucher. Along with its Click and Collect service, Superbalist also offers buyers free standard delivery for orders over R350, next-day delivery, same-day delivery, and weekend delivery.
