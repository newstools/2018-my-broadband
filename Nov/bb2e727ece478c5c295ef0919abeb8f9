Apple is launching a pilot programme that will extend the time period in which customers with older devices can receive repairs, 9to5Mac reports. The programme, named the Repair Vintage Apple Products Pilot, will cover a number of Apple products which are about to become obsolete. These products reportedly include the iPhone and MacBook Air models initially launched in 2012, and iMac models from 2011. According to the report, Apple will add support for the iPhone 4s and 2012 MacBook Pro on 30 November, followed by more MacBook Pro models on 30 December. Traditionally, Apple has offered repairs for devices that are between 5-7 years old. Older devices are classified as obsolete or “vintage”. This new programme doesn’t guarantee that vintage devices will be repaired, but it does allow the company to continue supporting older devices after they have become “obsolete”.
