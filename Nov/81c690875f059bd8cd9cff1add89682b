Zando has announced it will run a special 90s Black Friday 2018 sale. According to a press release from the online fashion retailer, customers will be able to purchase products from brands that were big back in the 90s for as much as a 90% discount. “A lot has changed in the decades since, but that shouldn’t mean we can’t embrace the nostalgia of such an iconic era,” said Zando. Zando will also offer a variety of deals on major brands, including Adidas and Puma, which will be discounted by up to 70%. Two deals that Zando will be offering on Black Friday are shown below.
