Black Mesa, a modernised rework of the original Half-Life game, is nearly completed. Crowbar Collective, the fan-run creator of Black Mesa, released a trailer for the final stages of the game. The original Half-Life game celebrated its 20th birthday on 19 November, and the Black Mesa developers used this 20th birthday as an opportunity to release the latest trailer, which outlines its take on the Xen dimension of the original game. Valve hasn’t released any Half-Life titles since the 2007 game Half-Life 2: Episode Two, and it seems unlikely that this will change in the foreseeable future. Instead, Valve seems focused on Steam, as well as games like Dota 2, leaving the Half-Life torch firmly in the hands of fan-run entities like Crowbar Collective. The latest Black Mesa trailer can be viewed below. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
