The SABC stated on Twitter that its camera equipment was stolen at the state capture enquiry. According to reports on Twitter, the equipment was stolen while the commission was on a break, with an SABC journalist tweeting an image of the alleged thief. A video was also tweeted, and retweeted by the SABC, which shows the alleged thief leaving the commission and entering a taxi. This is not the first time the SABC has been a victim of crime while covering the news. Four years ago, an SABC cameraman was mugged on live TV outside Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg.
