Cell C offers users various fixed-LTE packages, which are a great substitute for fibre if it is not available in your area. There are two sets of packages which run on the Cell C network – consisting of products from Cell C, and products from local ISPs which run on Cell C’s network. Both are marketed as LTE-Advanced, and include a monthly data allotment along with an LTE router. The packages available directly from Cell C are 24-month contracts, however, while the packages from local ISPs are typically month-to-month deals. There is a cancellation clause with the ISP deals, though, which states that if you cancel your package in the first six month you are liable for a R999 cancellation fee. To show users the differences between the two sets of packages, we have provided a feature comparison below. The table below shows the LTE packages on offer. Besides the difference in contract terms – the 24-month vs month-to-month options – there are several other differences between the two sets of packages.
