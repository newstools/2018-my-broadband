According to a press invitation issued by Standard Bank, its new MVNO – Standard Bank Mobile – will be revealed on 21 November. Standard Bank Mobile promises to provide a “next level connection” according to the invitation. Standard Bank’s move to have its own MVNO comes after multiple other companies have done the same in South Africa – including FNB with FNB Connect. FNB Connect offers voice and mobile data services on Cell C’s network, and is integrated into FNB’s banking business. Cell C currently dominates the MVNO space in South Africa, and provides its services to a variety of companies. Cell C said it enables companies to create MVNOs by allowing them access to Cell C network infrastructure, upon which these companies can offer their own products and services. A Standard Bank spokesperson previously said they cannot share specific details about the mobile service at this point.
