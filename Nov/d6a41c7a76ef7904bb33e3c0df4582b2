20 teams from South African universities will be seeking national honours in the 7th Student Cluster Competition at the annual CHPC conference. Teams will build small high-performance computing clusters on the exhibition floor from hardware provided, and run a series of benchmarks on their systems. The winning team will be entered into the International Supercomputing Conference Student Cluster Competition in Germany next year. South Africa has been participating in the international competition since 2013 and won it in 2013, 2014, and 2016, coming second in 2015 and 2017. In June this year, the team came third to two teams from China at the cluster challenge in Frankfurt, Germany. Three keynote addresses will also be delivered at the conference â€“ by Patricia Damkroger of Intel, Michael Foley, formerly of the World Bank, and Elmarie Biermann of the Cyber Security Institute. The CHPC conference runs from 2-6 December.
