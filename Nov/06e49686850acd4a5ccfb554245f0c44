Gumtree announced it has partnered with property technology company HouseME to offer improved house rental services on its online platform. As a result of this collaboration, Gumtree is now able to verify prospective tenants through a rigorous vetting process and reduce the risk for property owners. HouseME uses smart technology to connect and verify tenants, collect rent, and digitally coordinate the complete viewing, administration and payment process. These services can cost landlords as little as 2.5% of rental, and the company offers a three-month rental guarantee. “HouseME is excited to extend further value to South African landlords and assist in reducing the risks associated with property rental – of which late payments, defaulters and managing deposits are just a few,” said HouseME CEO Ben Shaw. “We are excited about this collaboration, and look forward to working with Gumtree as we serve a broad part of the market together,” Shaw said. Gumtree said that this partnership would greatly assist landlords in connecting with legitimate tenants through the platform. “We have more than 36,000 property rental listings and we know that linking up with HouseME will make life a lot easier, and more profitable, for many of the landlords who use Gumtree,” said Gumtree SA GM Director Claire Cobbledick.
