According to Softpedia, Lenovo has reached a settlement of $7.3 million after consumers sued the company for pre-installing adware on Lenovo devices. In 2014, Lenovo and Superfish entered into a deal to install Superfish’s VisualDiscovery software onto new Lenovo notebooks. Those suing Lenovo claimed this software slowed down their notebooks by running in the background without their knowledge. According to Lenovo, VisualDiscovery was designed to intercept HTTP and HTTPS traffic, decrypting and monitoring all traffic – potentially creating a vulnerability for users. The Superfish software was installed on about 800,000 notebooks across a variety of models, including the E, Edge, G, Z, and Yoga series, between September 2014 and February 2015. Superfish previously made a million-dollar payment for its role in the controversy.
