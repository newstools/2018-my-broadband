EA has provided additional details about how it plans to remaster two classic Command & Conquer titles. The publisher has stated it will release remastered versions of both Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert. Classic expansion packs Covert Ops, Counterstrike, and Aftermath will also form part of this project. EA is partnering with Petroglyph Games to execute the remastering of these titles. Petroglyph Games includes Command & Conquer co-creator Joe Bostic, as well as Red Alert’s lead programmer Steve Tall. Mike Legg is another Petroglyph Games employee who was involved with Command & Conquer’s original developer, Westwood Studios. EA will also be partnering with Lemon Sky Studios, a leading art studio that specialises in remastering classic titles, to boost the resolution of the two Command & Conquer titles up to 4K.
