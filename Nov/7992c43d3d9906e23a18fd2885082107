SITA will host 200 participants over a 48-hour hackathon at the Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg between 30 November and 2 December. The #NDP2030 Hackathon campaign was launched earlier this year and called on all sectors and South Africans to come up with innovative and functioning ideas that aim to solve the socio-economic challenges that South Africa faces, as defined in our 2030 National Development Plan. From the submitted proposals, 200 selected participants will gather under one roof to finalise their proposed solutions across three main categories: Participants will be put into small teams, with a mix of skill sets, and mentorship will be provided by SITA as well as other industry partners. At the close of the 48-hour period, teams will present to a panel of judges who will select nine winning solutions across the three categories. These solutions will go into a process of solution realisation, demonstration and deployment with the purpose of creating real change in South Africa and accelerating the implementation of the NDP2030 outcomes. #NDP2030 Hackathon, presented by SITA 30 November â€“ 2 December Sandton Convention Centre Cost: Free Website: This article was published in partnership with SITA.
