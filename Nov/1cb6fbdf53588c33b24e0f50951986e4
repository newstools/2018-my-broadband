Core Group has announced that it is now a certified service centre for DJI. Linda van der Nest, Core Group Marketing Executive, said that its technicians are trained directly by DJI and have the capability to repair DJI products. “DJI is the world’s leader in civilian drones and aerial imaging technology,” said the company. “DJI is dedicated to making aerial photography and filmmaking equipment and platforms more accessible, reliable, and easier to use for creators and innovators around the world.” This follows Core Group announcing in September that it was the official distributor of DJI in the region.
