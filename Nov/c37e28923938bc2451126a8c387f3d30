Takealot has confirmed that it will open a new customer centre in Johannesburg. This follows a report by TechCentral that the online retailer was considering opening a new facility on the N1 highway in Midrand, situated on the New Road bridge. A distribution centre at this location would cater to customers in both Johannesburg and Pretoria, it stated. Takealot has an existing customer centre in Cape Town for customer collections, but only a distribution centre in Johannesburg – where customers cannot pick up orders. Speaking in an interview with MyBroadband, Takealot CEO Kim Reid confirmed they will open a new customer centre in Johannesburg where buyers can pick up purchases. He said that Takealot will announce more information about the customer centre in 2019. “We are busy with that, and will be able to provide more details next year,” said Reid. He added that customers can also expect to benefit from Superbalist’s Click + Collect locations in the near future. “What people can expect next year, is that we have rolled out 23 Click + Collect points for Superbalist and we will make those live [for Takealot deliveries],” Reid said.
