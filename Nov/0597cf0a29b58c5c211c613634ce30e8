According to a report by Strategy Analytics, Nintendo will sell slightly more Switch consoles worldwide than Sony will sell PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro consoles. The study predicts that Nintendo will sell 17.3 million Switch consoles, whereas Sony is expected to sell 17.1 million. Xbox One and Xbox One X sales are expected to lag behind, with 10 million predicted console sales. The report also highlighted that 2018 has been the best year for console sales since 2010, with 46.1 million systems being sold so far this year. Sony still dominates the console market, with nearly half of all consoles currently in use being Sony devices. Next year’s console revenue is also predicted to fall by as much as 10%, with the market taking 5 years to return to this year’s levels – thanks in large part to the release of next-generation consoles.
