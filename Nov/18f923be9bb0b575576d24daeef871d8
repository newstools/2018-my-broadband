We’ll keep it short and sweet. Black Friday weekend is hard to resist, and most of us will be clicking ‘Add to Cart’ late into the evening. The last thing you’ll be thinking of buying is life insurance. But Indie’s life insurance is different. They want to help you create wealth, not get rid of it, and they’re here to give you a little something back into your wallet, just for joining. Buy any Indie policy between Black Friday and Cyber Monday (the 23rd to the 26th of Nov) and they’’ll boost your Wealth Bonus by up to R5000. That’s a potential R5000 extra to invest, and grow, and eventually spend however you like. Check out the breakdown below to see what you could be earning: Want to know more?
