SANRAL has issued a statement warning drivers that traffic on national highways will pick up earlier than usual this year. The agency said that due to the public schools closing on 12 December, traffic on busy routes such as the N3 to Durban will become very heavy from Friday 14 December, as this is the beginning of a long weekend. SANRAL added that the N3 freeway between Gauteng and the KwaZulu-Natal coastal resorts is in good condition and travellers will not experience any delays caused by road works during the holiday season. Traffic is expected to peak on Friday 21 December, with surges also predicted on 31 December 2018 and 7 January 2019. Drivers should remain cautious and adjust their speed depending on weather and visibility, SANRAL communication manager Vusi Mona said. “Road user behaviour contributes a lot to road crashes and we appeal to motorists to respect the rules of the road and to also ensure their vehicles are roadworthy,” Mona said. The agency also noted that customers can download its mobile app to top up their e-toll accounts directly from their smartphones.
