Update – Standard Bank has said that its card services have now been restored. Standard Bank has confirmed on Twitter that it is experiencing problems with card acceptance at point of sale and ATMs. This has left customers unable to make payments with their cards or draw cash, leaving them with no recourse if they are unlucky enough to not have any cash on them. Standard Bank said its support teams were working to resolve the problem, but at this point is not yet resolved. This follows a recent major systems outage this past weekend, which resulted in Standard Bank customers being unable to make card or electronic payments at point-of-sale devices or through payment apps. Customers were affected by this outage for a few hours before systems returned back to normal, and Standard Bank has not yet confirmed what caused the problem. Dear valued customer. We are experiencing acceptance issues with our cards at point of sale and ATM facilities. Please rest assured that our support teams are attending to the matter. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. — Standard Bank SA (@StandardBankZA) November 13, 2018
