Having a reliable email system is one of the most important elements of running a business in 2018. If your email is down, your business operations will most likely grind to a halt. That’s why it’s imperative that your email is always online and accessible. LiquidCloud offers a powerful hosted exchange product, allowing you to utilise their extensive Microsoft Exchange hosting knowledge as they ensure that your email platform is always available. LiquidCloud offers month-to-month billing, providing flexibility by ensuring you aren’t committed to a long-term contract. LiquidCloud also allows you to access your emails from anywhere, on a variety of devices – meaning that you always have access to your mailbox. You also only pay for the mailboxes you use, giving you the ability to scale on demand without penalties. Pricing is in rands, which ensures that your monthly costs don’t fluctuate in accordance with exchange rates. LiquidCloud’s offering allows for full exchange collaboration to achieve synchronisation across all devices, with access to business email, calendar and contacts.
