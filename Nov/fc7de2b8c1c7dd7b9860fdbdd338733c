According to benchmarks on Geekbench, the new iPad Pro is nearly as powerful as the 2018 15-inch MacBook Pro. Comfortably the most powerful iPad ever made, the iPad Pro boasts a single-core score of 5,025 , which places it above the MacBook Pro 2.2GHz Core i7 – 4,928. It is also only slightly below the 2.6GHz Core i7 version, which scores 5,053. The iPad Pro’s multi-core score of 18,106, however, is still substantially below the MacBook Pro’s “weakest” option, which scores 21,165. This performance benchmark is particularly impressive when you consider that the 2018 iPad Pro costs less than a third of the “weakest” MacBook Pro. Apple announced that the new iPad Pro can achieve up to 90% faster multi-core performance than last year’s model, and that single-core CPU performance has improved by up to 35%.
