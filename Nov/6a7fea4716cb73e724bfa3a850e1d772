ESPN has lost two million subscribers over the past 12 months, decreasing from 88 million subscribers last year to 86 million this year. ESPN is included in most american cable packages, so it’s decline points to a wider move away from cable subscriptions, according to Engadget. Other Disney-owned channels also reported substantial losses, including the Disney Channel, Disney Junior, and Disney XD – all of which lost 3 million subscribers. ESPN has looked to offset the move away from cable TV by introducing ESPN+, which includes a variety of live and archived sports streams. ESPN+ has gained a million subscribers in five months – a result that underscores how viewers are moving from cable to streaming services.
