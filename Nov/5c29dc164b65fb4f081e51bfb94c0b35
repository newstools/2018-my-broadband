The latest version of Operaâ€™s web browser for Android now includes the ability to block cookie dialog boxes. This feature automatically blocks dialog boxes which pop up on websites asking for permission to allow cookies. It should be noted that simply blocking the pop-ups will not block the cookies, and users will have to choose whether they want to block or allow all cookies, or only block those from third parties. Users can access this feature by navigating to Settings > Ad Blocking within the Android app. Opera has also added quick access to QR scanning, searching and shortcut creation, along with improving its text wrap and text size tools. The option to block cookie dialog boxes within Opera will roll out to other platforms in the future, the company said.
