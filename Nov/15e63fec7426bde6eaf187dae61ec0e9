Intel recently unveiled its new Core i9-9980XE processor, which boasts 18 physical cores and 36 threads. The high-end desktop processor is built on a refined version of Intel’s 14nm manufacturing process, which is the same process node used by its 6th, 7th, and 8th-gen chips. It also boasts a base clock speed of 3.0GHz and Intel Turbo Boost clock speed of 4.5GHz, along with a TDP of 165W. Reviews and benchmark data for the new chip have begun to appear online, and initial results show that the processor offers strong single-threaded and multi-threaded performance. According to benchmark data from HotHardware, the Intel Core i9-9980XE boasts better single-threaded performance than any AMD Ryzen Processor, while it also outperformed all previous-generation Intel chips in multi-threaded performance. The chip is extremely powerful and can even be overlocked, but its pricing is significantly higher than its AMD competitors. Intel’s Core i9-9980XE is priced at $1,979 and will be available later this month.
