China Telecom Middle East and Africa (CTMEA) is establishing an interconnection network and telecommunications hub at Teraco. CTMEA established its network nodes in Teraco’s data centres in Cape Town, Durban, and Johannesburg in 2012, providing a hub linking global Internet resources to Africa. Teraco’s data centre services will now be bundled with China Telecom’s ICT solutions, catering to increasing demands. “Our customers in China and Asia-Pacific region will now find it even more convenient to subscribe to a reliable, trusted, and high-quality colocation and connectivity services from Teraco and China Telecom Global,” said CTMEA managing director Changhai Liu. “We have long been focusing on the Africa market and this closer cooperation with Teraco further enhances our competitiveness in the Middle East and Africa with a strong and like-minded partner in Southern Africa we can rely on.” “Teraco has been investing to expand our data centre facilities with additional capacity and floor space to meet increasing demands from enterprises and from the surge in cloud computing uptake,” said Teraco director Jan Hnizdo. “Our relationship with China Telecom Global opens up African opportunities for Chinese content and applications, which means a growing network and higher communications traffic in the African region to the East.”
