Comic Con Africa is taking place at the Kyalami Convention Centre from 14-16 September 2018, and will feature a range of international stars as guests. These guests include Anthony Mackie – known in the Marvel universe as The Falcon. For big fans of these actors, the show provides an opportunity to have a photograph with them – or receive their autograph. VIP ticket holders will receive a photo opportunity with their tickets, while “regular” ticket holders will have to book and pay for a photo op. Autographs are also available to attendees as an add-on to their ticket, with prices dependent on who you select. The photo ops and autograph sessions take place on certain days at certain times, and will require a booking in most cases. The prices for the photo ops are presented below. Comic Con Africa attendees can also purchase an autograph from their guest of choice as an add-on to their ticket. The autograph prices are presented below.
