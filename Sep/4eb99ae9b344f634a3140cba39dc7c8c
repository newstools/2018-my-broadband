BMW has unveiled its new Intelligent Personal Assistant, which is set to launch in March 2019. The in-car assistant responds to voice commands and can be addressed with “Hey BMW”. Customers can also choose their own wake-word for the software. Users will be able to control their car’s functionality with voice commands, and the assistant will be able to link to smartphones and smart speakers for external accessibility. BMW’s in-car assistant will also be compatible with other digital assistants, including Amazon Alexa. “BMW’s Intelligent Personal Assistant teams up with the new BMW Operating System 7.0 to create a new, digital form of interaction with the customer’s BMW that redefines the whole driving experience,” said BMW. From March 2019, BMW X5, Z4, and 8 Series models with BMW OS 7.0 will be able to install the full version of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant.
