MTN Supersonic was launched on 20 August 2018, promising to deliver the best customer experience in the South African fibre market. The service provider was created by combining MTN’s fibre-to-the-home operations with Smart Village, which it acquired from MultiChoice in 2015. MTN’s fibre business has essentially been placed under new management, rebranded as Supersonic, and given a more efficient operational structure. The company has its own management team who oversees 120 employees, of which 25 are trained technicians. Supersonic is headed up by Calvin Collett, who said it has taken them five months to development a business structure which will support their customer experience ambitions. The company has an initial target of connecting 25% of the fibre market – which comprises 800,000 homes, but is projected to pass as many as 2.2 million by 2022. Collett said the company is focusing on the main metros first, but will be expanding its network to other regions in future. “Where we can’t deliver a service, we will assist in providing access to MTN’s fixed-line LTE service,” said Collett. To differentiate itself from other ISPs, Supersonic’s value proposition is based on “simplicity, reliability, stability, and agility”. “A simple web-based five-step sign-up process is followed by the guarantee of a call-back in under 30 minutes – the system is currently working at call-back rates of as little as 15 minutes.” Supersonic further promises new subscribers that the installation and configuration process will be completed within 14 days. Supersonic is providing connectivity products on three fibre networks – Vumatel, Openserve, and its own.
