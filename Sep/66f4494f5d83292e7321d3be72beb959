Cloudflare has been subpoenaed to provide the personal information of several of its clients who operate BitTorrent indices and are alleged to operate “pirate” streaming services, TorrentFreak reported. According to the report, a group of movie companies including Bodyguard Productions, Cobbler Nevada, Criminal Productions, Dallas Buyers Club, and Venice PI recently obtained a Digital Millennium Copyright Act subpoena through a federal court in Hawaii. TorrentFreak reported that the group of companies are trying to hold site owners responsible for piracy damages. The subpoena orders Cloudflare to provide the personal information of the operators behind Showboxbuzz.com, Showbox.software, Rawapk.com, Popcorn-time.to, Popcorntime.sh, YTS.ag, and YTS.gg. No motion to quash was filed, TorrentFreak reported, stating that it is likely Cloudflare will hand over the information.
