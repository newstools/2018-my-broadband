Qualcomm has unveiled its next-generation smartwatch platform, the Snapdragon Wear 3100. The new system-on-a-chip (SoC) boasts improved power efficiency and low-power system architecture to support extended battery life. “By using a hierarchical approach with the high-performance A7 processors, the highly-efficient integrated DSP, and the new ultra-low-power co-processor, we look to fundamentally reimagine the smartwatch experience while supporting extended battery life,” said Qualcomm. The company has improved the battery life of its chipset by adopting a number of low-power techniques for GPS, clock updates, sensors processing, and Bluetooth, too. Qualcomm’s new processor also supports an enhanced Ambient Mode with up to 16 colours, adaptive brightness, and live complications. This results in a battery life improvement of 4-12 hours, depending on the application. Qualcomm said the new platform is supported by Google, which plans to evolve its Wear OS for smart devices going forward.
