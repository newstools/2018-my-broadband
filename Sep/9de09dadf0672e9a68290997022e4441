Asteroid and NAPAfrica have entered into a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on developing African Internet interconnection. Both companies aim to promote peering and local interconnection, emphasising Internet exchange points (IXPs) as essential for the Internet ecosystem. “We are proud to be teaming up with NAPAfrica to combine our competence and experience in IXPs and peering”, said Asteroid CCO Nurani Nimpuno. “We believe that Africa holds great potential for Internet growth, but there are still real challenges to solve in terms of in-country interconnection.” “Asteroid has a solid team of reputable IXP experts. We are incredibly excited about their lean, efficient, and highly automated IXP model, and we think it’s a good fit in Africa,” said NAPAfrica head of interconnection and peering Michele McCann. NAPAfrica and Asteroid have committed to promoting IXPs and local interconnection to improve the peering community in Africa.
