Verizon in the US has unveiled Verizon 5G Home, which it calls a world-first. The service is aimed at home users and offers 5G connectivity via a 5G Ultra Wideband Network. It will initially only be available in a few cities and will go live from 1 October 2018. “Verizon Wireless customers with a qualifying smartphone plan will pay $50 per month for the service, while non-Verizon Wireless customers will pay $70 per month,” said the company. For this, users receive uncapped data usage at speeds of around 300Mbps – with peak speeds of close to 1Gbps. “Verizon 5G Home is ideal for consumers looking to cut the cord or upgrade from their current cable service,” said Verizon. 5G Home customers will also get YouTube TV free for three months, and a free Apple TV 4K or Google Chromecast Ultra device. Installation and a free router is also included, along with router upgrades when they become available in 2019.
