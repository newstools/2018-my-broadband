Vodacom has stated that it is working on support for eSIMs. “Vodacom is currently developing support for eSIM in conjunction with the various device manufacturers and will launch commercial support at the appropriate time,” said Vodacom. The statement from Vodacom follows questions from MyBroadband on the network’s plans for eSIMs. Apple’s new iPhones feature eSIM technology – with a dual-SIM set-up consisting of a single physical SIM and one eSIM. An eSIM is an embedded SIM which is built into a device and needs to be enabled by a mobile network to function. Vodacom stated in October 2017, following the launch of the Apple Watch Series 3 Cellular, that it would be ready to support eSIM technology if it launched in South Africa. Rain Mobile has stated that it is also looking at eSIM support, and will engage with Apple to support the technology in new iPhones.
