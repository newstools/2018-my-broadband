Nintendo recently launched its Switch Online subscription service for gamers. Switch Online includes the ability to save your game progress to the cloud, but the serviceâ€™s website implied that once you stop paying your subscription fee these save games will no longer be accessible. Speaking to IGN, a Nintendo spokesperson clarified that if a Switch owner stops paying their subscription for Switch Online, their saves would not be immediately lost. Users will be able to recover their previous cloud saves if they resubscribe to the Switch Online service within six months, the spokesperson said. However, they will not be able to access these cloud saves until they resubscribe to the service. In addition to offering cloud backups for game saves, Switch Online allows users to participate in online multiplayer and access classic Nintendo game bundles.
