BitCo will launch a fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) offering on 1 October 2018. The company said its FTTH packages would be uncapped and available in speeds of 20Mbps, 50Mbps, 100Mbps, and 200Mbps. BitCo previously offered business packages exclusively, focussing on small-to-medium enterprises along with large companies. “Our customers have been asking us to expand our services to the home market for some time,” said BitCo sales director Michael Colin. “We are now ready to launch the FTTH product and offer competitive packages coupled with the support that home customers deserve.” The company’s FTTH products will feature month-to-month packages, a free-to-use router, and no data limits. “With competitive pricing, 24-hour support, no contracts, and a free-to-use router, we’re certain avid Internet users will welcome us home.” Customers can sign up for BitCo’s FTTH packages on the company’s website from 1 October 2018.
