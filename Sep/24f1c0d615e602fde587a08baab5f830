Tinder has launched a new Top Picks feature for its premium Tinder Gold platform, TechCrunch reports. Tinder Gold is the dating app’s premium platform which includes a selection of tools and features to help paying subscribers match with a partner. The new Top Picks feature provides users with a curated list of their best potential matches, reducing the need to manually filter out those who are not a good fit. These choices are selected based on the user’s previous swiping behaviour as well as the education, hobbies, interests, and professional occupation of potential matches. Top Picks displays a limited number of potential matches which will refresh on a daily basis, but users can opt to buy more picks with an in-app purchase. This feature is only available to Tinder Gold subscribers and has reportedly launched in the Tinder app worldwide.
