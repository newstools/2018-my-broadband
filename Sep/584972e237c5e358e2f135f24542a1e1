The SABC will retrench hundreds of its employees, Sowetan Live reported. The SABC announced in a meeting with unions that it has been forced to lay off workers due to its financial situation and high salary costs – as it is struggling to fund its R1-billion annual wage bill. Employees were notified that the public broadcaster would retrench workers via an internal memo, although no other information was given. Unions have begun informing workers of the lay-offs, with Bemawu (the Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers’ Union) conveying its regret over the retrenchment announcement. “We were informed that the salary bill is one of the highest costs, and the SABC is going to embark on this exercise to reduce staff,” said the union. The SABC’s annual financial report for 2018 reflected poor results, along with a long list of salaries for executive and senior management – many of whom received over R1 million in total remuneration for the year.
