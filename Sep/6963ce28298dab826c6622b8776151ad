The latest update for Waze adds support for CarPlay, according to the applicationâ€™s App Store page. This allows users who have updated to iOS 12 and are running the latest version of the navigation app to use Waze on the built-in screen in their vehicle. Waze on CarPlay includes support for voice search and allows users to report issues on their route to other drivers. Users can still accumulate points for using the Waze app with CarPlay, and the CarPlay version allows drivers to manually select daytime or night time interfaces. This follows a recent update to Google Maps which adds support for Apple CarPlay, meaning that both third-party navigation apps now work with the platform.
