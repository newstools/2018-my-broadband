MyBroadband’s 2018 Salary Survey results revealed that Master of Business Administration (MBA or MBL) graduates enjoy the highest average salaries of all IT professionals. The salary survey was conducted in September and was completed by 2,695 IT professionals in South Africa. To ensure accurate results, various filters were applied to eliminate entries which were unlikely to be a true reflection of local salaries and perceptions of the industry. The results showed what most people already know – a higher qualification typically means that you will get a higher salary. There was, however, one exception. IT professionals with only a matric earned more than those who did a certification or diploma. The likely reason for this is that many IT professionals, like programmers, are self-taught and can demand high salaries because of their skill and experience. The average salary – gross monthly salary, without bonuses – for IT professionals and executives in South Africa in 2018 is R42,673 per month. The tables below show how the salaries of IT professionals with different qualifications compare with this average.
