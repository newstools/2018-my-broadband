MultiChoice is challenging a ruling by the Federal High Court in Abuja which prevents MultiChoice Nigeria from increasing its DStv subscription prices. MultiChoice Nigeria planned to increase the price of its DStv packages in the country on 1 August 2018, with increases ranging between 5.26% and 7.95%. The planned DStv price increases did not sit well with subscribers, and after a public outcry Nigeria’s Consumer Protection Council (CPC) lodged a court application to stop the price hikes. According to the CPC, the court action formed part of an investigation based on consumer complaints about MultiChoice’s arbitrary DStv pricing. The CPC said it was also investigating MultiChoice’s exclusive content agreements which makes it harder for competitors to offer premium content. It was further looking into potential cross-subsidisation, with Multichoice Nigeria increasing DStv prices in the country to make up for losses in other countries. The court has also restrained MultiChoice Nigeria from interfering with investigations into the company. MultiChoice would not comment on whether it views the Federal High Court’s ruling as fair. Instead, the company told MyBroadband that MultiChoice Nigeria was not represented in the initial proceedings – which were launched after the price increase had been implemented. This, the company said, means the court did not hear its arguments on this matter. “However, we have been granted leave to appeal and the matter is now before the Appeals Court,” MultiChoice said. Unhappiness about annual price increases and complaints about MultiChoice’s “monopolistic behaviour” are nothing new in South Africa. This year’s DStv price increases, which kicked in on 1 April, were met with a backlash from South African consumers. Comments like “They clearly don’t care about customer service but only profit” and “So glad I discontinued with DSTV. Don’t have to worry about this anymore” dominated discussions. Like Nigeria, the lack of competition in the pay-TV market in South Africa is under investigation. ICASA is currently looking at the pay-TV market, with a focus on: Remedies proposed by the regulator include shortening exclusive contracts, unbundling exclusive sports rights, introducing a wholesale-must-offer on sports channels, and opening up the dominant firm’s network. MultiChoice fought back in its oral presentation at the ICASA hearings, arguing that regulatory intervention is not warranted. The company said it is facing increased competition from online streaming services like Netflix, which has an “unfair advantage” over DStv in South Africa. MultiChoice SA CEO Calvo Mawela said the current regulatory regime is focused on traditional pay-TV services and does not look at streaming players like Netflix. MultiChoice called on ICASA to ensure the regulatory environment takes the changing entertainment landscape into account. MultiChoice added that the court ruling in Nigeria which prevents DStv price increases will have no impact on the service it provides to customers. “However, would like to point out that MultiChoice Nigeria is a registered business in Nigeria which has its own local shareholders and operations – separate from MultiChoice South Africa,” it said. “In any country of operation, pricing is dependent on the local conditions and long-term commercial viability.” MultiChoice explained that annual DStv price increases are necessary because its costs to operate the business increase each year. “We need to make adjustments to the prices of our packages to ensure we can continue to offer our customers the best local and international content,” said MultiChoice. “MultiChoice will always endeavour to keep price increases to a minimal to remain affordable to customers.”
