The most successful accountants are those who approach the world as a child would. They’re curious about their surroundings, ask questions, and adapt quickly and easily to change.

Yet, the majority of accountants today lack the confidence to adopt this mindset shift, preventing them from becoming the trusted advisors their clients desperately need. As a result, they undersell themselves and risk becoming redundant, as technology advancements make it easier for anyone to crunch the numbers.
