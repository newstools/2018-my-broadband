Luno recently launched its new African regional headquarters in Johannesburg, South Africa. Luno is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in South Africa and operates in over 40 markets across Europe and Africa. Opening African regional headquarters in Johannesburg will allow the company to expand into additional markets on the continent, said the company. “The new team in Johannesburg will be working closely with our team in Lagos, Nigeria to launch across a number of African markets over the coming months,” said Luno CEO Marcus Swanepoel. To get the expansion going, Luno is hiring a number of new employees for its Johannesburg office. The company is recruiting for over 30 roles and aims to create a new engineering team. Luno already has a development team based in Cape Town, but aims to expand its engineering capacity, it said. Speaking to MyBroadband, Luno country manager for South Africa Marius Reitz said the company has various initial positions available – with more being advertised as recruiting progresses. “We are first looking to hire senior engineers to have the technical leadership on the ground before we will start advertising for intermediate and graduate-level engineering roles,” said Reitz. “These will go live in the coming weeks. More roles will go live soon, including roles for our South African country team – marketing and operations – and roles supporting our African expansion plans.” Luno is looking to fill the following positions over the next six months: The available job openings can be accessed on the Luno careers page.
