MTN has told MyBroadband it is working with Apple to bring eSIM support to its users. “MTN is working with Apple to introduce this feature – eSIM – to its customers in the future,” said MTN. The statement from MTN follows questions from MyBroadband on the network’s plans for eSIMs. Apple’s new iPhones feature eSIM technology – with a dual-SIM set-up consisting of a single physical SIM and one eSIM. An eSIM is an embedded SIM which is built into a device and needs to be enabled by a mobile network to function. Rain Mobile and Vodacom have stated they are also working on eSIM support.
