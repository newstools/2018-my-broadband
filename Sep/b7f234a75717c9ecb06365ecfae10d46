The ANC’s official website is no longer online, following reports that the party owes its service provider millions. Navigating to the website at www.anc.org.za returns a “No input file specified” response. Inspecting the site in a browser also shows a 404 Not Found response. According to a Business Live report, attorneys for Unwembi Communications have instructed the company – a website service provider – to halt its services until the ANC has paid R32.5 million. Despite this, ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe claims it does not have a contract with Unwembi Communications. “The only reason why our website is down is because we are revamping it. It has nothing to do with us not paying people,” Mabe said. Unwembi Communications is the registered owner of the anc.org.za domain, granting it the ability to essentially hold it to ransom in this situation.
