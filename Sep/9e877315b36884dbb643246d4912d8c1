If you’re a PC gamer, there’s a very high chance you’ve played on an Intel powered notebook or desktop. Intel unveiled its first Core i9 chip for laptops earlier this year, and updated Core i5 and i7 processors that include 6 cores of power instead of the usual quad-core processors. All of these new processors are primarily designed for gaming and high-performance laptops. From a gaming perspective the latest and greatest gaming notebooks consist of Intel’s 8th generation Core i5 & Core i7 processor, 8GB to 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of NVMe PCIe storage. The 15.6-inch 1080p IPS display also includes 144Hz response rates and support for Nvidia’s G-Sync technology with either a GTX 1060 or GTX 1070. In addition, all 8th Gen models support thunderbolt 3 Technology. One of the biggest drivers of the PC gaming renaissance has been the growing popularity of esports, where players and teams play PC games competitively to a huge – and expanding – audience. It’s also something that Intel has been very involved with. eSports has got a massive following – about 385 million people worldwide are following eSports – and for Intel this is a really important endeavour. Intel works directly with the electronic sport league, with the ESL, and they have the Intel Extreme Masters competition. The company invests heavily in eSports to make sure that they understand what that specific audience needs, and how they can bring the gaming enthusiasts the best gaming notebooks to deliver AAA games.
