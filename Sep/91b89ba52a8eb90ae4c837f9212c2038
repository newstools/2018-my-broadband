MTN launched voice over LTE (VoLTE) services on its network this week, branded as HD Voice. “The HD Voice service will allow customers to benefit from voice calls in clear, natural-sounding HD Voice on MTN’s LTE network – coupled with a faster call connection time,” MTN said. The first phase of the rollout will support Samsung S8 and S8+, Huawei P20 Lite, Sony Xperia XZ2, and CAT S61 devices, it added. MTN told MyBroadband that the second phase of the programme will be rolled out from October. “MTN will update the public in due course on when other smartphone brands and models can access HD Voice service,” said MTN. MyBroadband also spoke to MTN about the benefits and costs of the VoLTE service. While the term LTE usually refers to data services, VoLTE revolves around voice traffic over the network. MTN said its HD Voice offers customers “clear and natural-sounding” calls, along with a faster call set-up time. This means calls connect quicker. The company added that there are no additional costs to activate the service, and customers will pay their existing postpaid or prepaid rates.
