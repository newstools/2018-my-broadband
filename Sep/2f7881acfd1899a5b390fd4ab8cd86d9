In this week’s tech deals, Makro is running two sweet TV specials. The first is a 65-inch UHD OLED TV from LG, with R15,000 off the price. OLED is as good as it gets when it comes to display technology – with contrast and colours produced that normal LCD panels cannot replicate. Makro also has a 65-inch Hisense UHD TV on sale for R12,999 – a nice model for those looking to get their first large UHD TV and have a set budget. More deals are posted below.
