On Thursday, the Commission for Conciliation‚ Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) dismissed former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s bid to get his job back at the state broadcaster. Motsoeneng was dismissed from the SABC in 2017 for bringing the organisation into disrepute and causing irreparable damage to his employer. This followed a press briefing on 19 April 2017, where Motsoeneng, defended his “90% local” policy which he implemented at the SABC. The SABC said in a statement that it welcomes the CCMA’s decision to dismiss Motsoeneng’s case. SABC spokesperson Neo Momodu said the decision vindicates the SABC’s processes as procedurally and substantively fair. “This is testimony of the effectiveness of the strategies that the SABC is embarking on to restore the credibility and integrity of the corporation,” Momodu said. “The SABC remains committed to enforcing sound governance procedures aimed at re-establishing a culture of accountability in the public broadcaster.”
