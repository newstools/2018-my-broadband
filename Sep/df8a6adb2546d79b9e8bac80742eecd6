Google has launched its latest version of Chrome, which features a new design, password manager, and more. The Chrome upgrade also marks 10 years since Chrome was launched, said Google. The first thing users will notice are the new rounded tabs at the top of their browser when they open a webpage, which bring a cleaner and more modern look. “Chrome has a new look. You can see it across all platforms – desktop, Android, and iOS – where you’ll notice more rounded shapes, new icons, and a new colour palette,” said Google. This make website icons easier to see in tabs and will help users on mobile browse faster, said Google.  Chrome now also packs a new UI, which ensures the browser can more accurately fill in passwords, addresses, and credit card numbers – so that “you can breeze through online checkout forms”. “We’ve also significantly improved the way Chrome handles passwords. Staying secure on the web means using strong and unique passwords for every different site. When it’s time to create a new password, Chrome will now generate one for you. Chrome will save it, and next time you sign in, it’ll be there, on both your laptop and phone,” said Google. The updates don’t stop there, and Google has further refined its Omnibox – the search bar at the top of the browser. The Omnibox will now show you answers directly in the address bar without having to open a new tab. This includes rich results on public figures or sporting events, to instant answers like the local weather. “Plus, a bonus if you find yourself with two dozen tabs open across three browser windows: Search for a website in your Omnibox and Chrome will tell you if it’s already open and let you jump straight to it with Switch-to-tab. Users are also able to create and manage shortcuts to websites directly from the “new tab” page, with the “Add shortcut” feature, said Google. The latest version of Google Chrome is available for download now.
