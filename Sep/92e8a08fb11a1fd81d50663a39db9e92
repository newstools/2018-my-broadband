China has blocked popular video game streaming platform Twitch after the country saw a surge in the service’s popularity, Abacus reports. After the streaming platform began to see increased popularity in China, the Twitch website became inaccessible inside the country. The Twitch app also disappeared from the Apple App Store for Chinese users, suggesting a deliberate move to ban the service. Speaking to Abacus, a Twitch spokesperson confirmed that the streaming service is currently blocked in China – but did not state why. Chinese viewers recently turned to Twitch for coverage of the esports matches at the Asian Games, after the state broadcaster did not air them. Subsequently, the streaming service rapidly increased in popularity – becoming the third-most popular free app on the App Store.
