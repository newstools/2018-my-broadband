The organisers of PyConZA, LinuxConfZA, and PGConfZA have announced the “first ever” Open Source week. “This will be a monumental and historic first for South Africa, as we host a series of community-organised conferences and events for an entire week at the same venue,” said the organisers. Open Source week will run from 8-14 October 2018, and will be hosted at the Birchwood Hotel – 10 minutes away from OR Tambo airport outside of Johannesburg. The organisers stated that tickets for the conference are now available for attendees. Proposals for talks can also be submitted, along with sponsorship packages for companies.
