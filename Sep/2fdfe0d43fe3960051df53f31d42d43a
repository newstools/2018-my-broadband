Audi has started producing its first all-electric SUV, the e-tron quattro, Electrek reported. The automaker is set to unveil its production model of the electric SUV later this month. Member of the Board of Management for Production and Logistics at Audi Peter Kössler stated that its Brussels plant was overhauled for production of the e-tron SUV. “Our Brussels plant was comprehensively modernised for the production of the electric car. This is the world’s first certified CO2-neutral mass production in the premium segment,” he said. The battery technology and drive system for the vehicle was developed in-house by Audi, including its 95kWh battery pack and dual electric motors which boast a total output of 320kW.
