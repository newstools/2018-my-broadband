Qualcomm has accused Apple of stealing its trade secrets and giving them to Intel, Reuters reported. This was so that Apple could replace Qualcomm’s chips in its phones with ones from Intel, it alleged. Citing a planned legal filing, the report stated that Qualcomm intends to make a motion to amend a complaint it originally filed in November 2017. The motion alleges that Apple engaged in “inappropriate and deceitful conduct” and states that Apple stole Qualcomm’s trade secrets to improve “lower-quality modem chipsets”. This was allegedly to make “lower-quality” chipsets useable in Apple devices. According to Qualcomm, it provided Apple with confidential tools to help integrate its modems into the iPhone. Qualcomm said it has evidence showing that Apple engineers used its software to help Intel engineers improve the “sub-par performance” of its modems. Qualcomm previously informed investors that its modem chips have been removed from Apple’s product roadmap.
