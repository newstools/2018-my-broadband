Jaguar is launching an EV charging and powerway network in South Africa. This will see the company deploy 82 new public charging stations nationwide. “Jaguar, in partnership with electric vehicle charging authority GridCars, has laid the foundation for the future of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in South Africa,” it said. “The R30-million infrastructure investment will make day-to-day travel as well as long journeys possible for owners of electric vehicles.” Public charging stations will be installed in customer parking areas at every Jaguar Land Rover retailer in South Africa, along with 30 public charging stations in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London, and Bloemfontein. “South Africa’s city centres will now also be connected by the Jaguar Powerway – a series of 22 charging stations along the N3 between Gauteng and Durban, and the N1 between Gauteng and Cape Town. Cape Town will also be connected to the Garden Route with a series of charging stations along the N2 all the way to East London,” said Jaguar. The majority of charging stations on the network will be 60kWh, meaning “100km of range will take around 20 minutes for Jaguar I-PACE owners”. “A charge from 0% to 80% will take around 72 minutes.” All charging stations will also be equipped with a 22kWh AC fast charger to accommodate plug-in hybrid vehicles. “Jaguar Land Rover owners will use an RFID card to activate the charging station and manage electricity billing to the card,” added Jaguar. The current rate for 1kWh will be between R3.00 and R3.50, depending where in South Africa you are. “With a 90kWh battery, a full recharge in an I-PACE will cost between R270 and R315.” The Jaguar charging project will be operational by the end of November 2018.
