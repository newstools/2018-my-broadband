Huawei has announced it will launch its new Mate 20 Lite in South Africa next month. The device sports four AI-powered cameras paired with a HiSilicon Kirin 710 chipset, which has an integrated neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU powers a variety of artificial intelligence features which improve pictures taken with the dual front-facing cameras and dual rear cameras. Huawei’s Mate 20 Lite also features a modern smartphone design complete with FullView display, 81% screen-to-body ratio, and Android 8.1. “The Huawei Mate 20 Lite is yet another game-changer in innovation and intelligence from Huawei,” said Huawei Consumer Business Group SA GM Likun Zhao. The Huawei Mate 20 Lite is set to launch in South Africa on 31 October 2018. There is currently no local pricing available for the device.
