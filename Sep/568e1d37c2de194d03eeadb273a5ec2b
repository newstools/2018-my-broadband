FNB’s online banking system has been experiencing issues today, 10 September 2018, according to user reports. The bank also posted a notice on its Facebook page, confirming that it was experiencing technical issues with its online banking portal. “We apologise to impacted customers for any inconvenience caused. Our technical teams are resolving this,” FNB stated. When accessing the online banking platform, FNB customers were also presented with a message stating that functionality was limited due to system maintenance and that any payments made may not reflect immediately. “To avoid duplication please contact us before you make the same payment again,” stated the message. Customers also noticed that in certain cases their FNB bank accounts incorrectly reflected a balance of “R0” on the online banking page. The image below was sent to MyBroadband by a reader who is an FNB customer. He stated that the “balance” column for certain accounts was displaying “R0”, where it used to display what he had in his accounts. The reader has a cheque and credit account with the bank. MyBroadband has contacted FNB for comment on the matter.
