Faircom have been operating in the commercial fibre space in and around the greater Cape Town region since 2009. Today, through their own backbone network boosted by leading internet carriers, Faircom have access to the infrastructure and expertise needed to connect residential cluster developments and apartment blocks, as well as business parks. Faircom provides access over many Open-access Networks, including Internect (their own backbone network), Openserve, Frogfoot and Octotel. Full redundancy is achieved through points of presence at Teraco Cape Town and Internet Solutions. The lowest latency and fastest speeds are achieved by peering at Teraco Cape Town and Johannesburg, as well as the Cape Town and London Internet Exchanges. Their international capacity goes primarily via the West Africa Cable System (WACS) and towards the east via the Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System (EASSy).

Internect from R2,400 per month (on an Active fibre network) Octotel from R875 per month (on a GPON network) Our Commercial clients over Internect have a dedicated fibre pair. We only run an active fibre network and don’t use a GPON solution, primarily because on a GPON network the fibre can be split up to 128 times, i.e. there’s no guarantee of speeds as the bandwidth isn’t dedicated.
