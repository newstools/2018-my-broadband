ICASA intends to dispose of all electronic communications equipment it confiscated between 2000 and 2018. It said it is required, in terms of the law, to confiscate relevant equipment not type-approved and that does not meet the minimum standards set by law. “ICASA has been effective in exercising its mandate in this regard and has, in its possession, such electronic communications equipment in its different regional offices across the country,” said ICASA. “The authority is therefore inviting all parties whose electronic communications equipment has been confiscated between the year 2000 and 2018 for non-compliance with the regulations to make written representations motivating why such equipment should not be disposed of.” A copy of the confiscated slip issued by the ICASA Inspector is also required. Written representations must reach ICASA by no later than 18 September 2018, it stated.
