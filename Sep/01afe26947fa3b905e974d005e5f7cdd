GfK South Africa has released its latest research about technical consumer goods in the country, with it stating the market climbed 8% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2018. This was boosted by a 16% rise in the telecommunications sector and a 17.4% increase in small domestic appliances. “The data also shows that the major domestic appliances and consumer IT segments grew by 3% and 6.6% respectively,” stated the report. The smartphone segment also saw growth, thanks to an increase in sales of large-display devices and the adoption of entry-level smartphones. “Hot air fryers continued to drive the expansion of the small domestic appliance market as consumers opted for healthier lifestyles,” added the report. Kettles and toasters also registered double-digit growth in unit sales, due to an “increase in average selling price and robust consumer demand”. Tablet sales figures were not as robust, however, and the “media tablet category continued to deteriorate” – with a 42% drop in unit sales. A strong demand for UHD and large-screen TVs was also observed, while revenue in the audio home system and headphone categories dropped sharply. The monitor market also performed well, thanks to better desktop sales and a “growing selection of high-value monitors from major brands”. High-end cameras and printing cameras performed well in the period, but mid-range cameras did not. This was attributed to individuals using their smartphones for casual photography.
