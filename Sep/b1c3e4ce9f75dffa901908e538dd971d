MTN launched its Supersonic fibre products recently, promising a reliable and cost-effective connectivity solution. Although it is owned by MTN, Supersonic is an independently-run company which promises to deliver the best customer experience in the fibre market. Supersonic’s initial focus is on the consumer market, after which it will make a wholesale offering available to businesses. Supersonic was formed after MTN’s acquisition of Smart Village in late 2015 to make inroads in the fibre-to-the-home market. The fibre business has been placed under new management, and given a new and more efficient operational structure. The company plans to differentiate itself from other fibre ISPs is through “simplicity, reliability, stability, and agility”. Another key differentiator is that all its fibre options are uncapped, with prices starting at R658 per month. This raises the question: How do Supersonic’s prices compare with one of its main rivals, Vodacom? The table below shows that Supersonic’s prices are currently more affordable than Vodacom’s prices for similar products.
