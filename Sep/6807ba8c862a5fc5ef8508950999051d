Telkom has sent an email to staff detailing the particulars of its voluntary separation packages (VSP) and voluntary early retirement packages (VERP).

The details follow Telkom announcing on Thursday that it would offer the packages to employees from this week. “We estimate that Telkom has subsidised the South African mobile industry by about R70 billion since its inception. This subsidy has mainly been a result of regulatory decisions that impacted Telkom disproportionately,” stated the email. “During these regulatory cycles Telkom has sought to safeguard jobs from market and economic pressures.
