Athlon Games – the owner of Warframe developer Digital Extremes – has signed a long-term licensing agreement with Middle-Earth Enterprises to create a new video game based on the Lord of the Rings franchise. The publisher said it is working with a partner developer to build a new online game set in the world of Middle-Earth, long before the events of The Lord of The Rings. The upcoming title will include lands, people, and creatures which have not been seen before by Tolkien fans, the company said. “It’s a singular opportunity to work closely with Middle-earth Enterprises to create a completely new experience for fans of the landmark fantasy work of J.R.R. Tolkien, and we are excited about the resurgence of interest in The Lord of the Rings IP,” said Athlon Games president Dave Miller. “This, along with several other major properties Athlon is working with, will help us to further our goal of creating AAA cooperative console and PC experiences that gamers will want to play for years to come.” Middle-Earth Enterprises chief brand and licensing officer Fredrica Drotos said the organisation was pleased to work with Athlon games on the upcoming video game. “Athlon’s game will allow millions of Middle-earth fans throughout the world a unique opportunity for fellowship and epic exploration,” Drotos said.
