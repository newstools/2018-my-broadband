Consumers’ smartphone usage patterns are rapidly changing, with data-intensive applications becoming very popular. It has become normal for smartphone users to share photos and videos, and watch Netflix and YouTube in high definition. Even if people try to avoid data-hungry applications, websites are also getting larger and people share large files through email and messaging platforms. For smartphone users who are not connected to Wi-Fi for most of the day, a 500MB, 1GB, or 2GB data bundle is simply not enough for the month. Good news is that all mobile operators have big data packages available to make it more affordable to consume large amounts of mobile data. For high-end mobile users, Rain offers the best deal with its uncapped off-peak offer for R250 per month. Rain’s unlimited data usage is valid for 19 hours a day, except at peak times – 18:00 to 23:00 – when consumers pay the standard 5c per MB. Cell C’s prepaid offer of R1,999 for 200GB of data which lasts for a year is another good offer for high-end subscribers. The table below provides an overview of the best big data deals from mobile operators.
