The newest Windows 10 Insider preview build includes a pop-up warning when users attempt to install Google Chrome or Firefox. Upon opening the installation program for either of these browsers, Windows 10 opens a window which warns against installing the browser – stating that users “already have Microsoft Edge – the safer, faster browser for Windows 10”. Users can choose to open Microsoft Edge or install the third-party browser, and they can choose to disable future warnings by following a link to their OS Settings. Testers have confirmed that this window pops up when attempting to install Chrome and Firefox. This version of Windows 10 is currently only available to Windows 10 Insiders, but will be rolled out to the public as part of Microsoft’s Windows 10 October 2018 update. @MicrosoftEdge What kind of slimy marketing cesspool crap is this Microsoft? I proceed to launch the Firefox installer and Windows 10 pops this up? If I wanted to use your browser, I would. pic.twitter.com/f7jk9sGvYA — Sean Hoffman (@SeanKHoffman) September 11, 2018
