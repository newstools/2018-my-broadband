Microsoft has released the latest version of its Office software suite for Windows and Mac. The software release is aimed at users who haven’t subscribed to the company’s Office 365 service and includes updated versions of Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Publisher. Microsoft noted that Office 2019 is a once-off release and will not receive any future updates, unlike Microsoft’s Office 365 ProPlus subscription service. The Office 2019 version of Excel adds new data analysis features, including improvements to PowerPivot, while PowerPoint 2019 now includes the ability to create cinematic presentations with new features like Morph and Zoom. “Office 2019 is a valuable update for customers who aren’t yet ready for the cloud,” Microsoft said. “We’re pleased to confirm that we’re committed to another on-premises release in the future.” Commercial volume licence customers are able to access Office 2019 from today, and the software will roll out to all consumers over the next few weeks.
