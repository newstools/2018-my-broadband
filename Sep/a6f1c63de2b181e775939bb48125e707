Apple has added support for Google Maps to its CarPlay platform with iOS 12. The latest update for Google Maps – version 5.0 – is now available to all iOS users through the App Store and adds the ability to sync Google Maps navigation to your vehicle’s built-in display. This means that users who connect to their vehicle’s infotainment system with their iPhone will no longer be locked to Apple Maps. Apple is also adding support for other third-party navigation apps such as Waze, although this app has not yet added integration for the CarPlay service. The latest software update for Apple mobile devices, iOS 12, recently rolled out and includes a number of new improvements – such as Siri Shortcuts, Memoji, and new Photos features.
