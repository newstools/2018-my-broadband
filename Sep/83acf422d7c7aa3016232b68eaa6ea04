SEACOM has completed its 100% acquisition of KwaZulu-Natal-based Internet service provider SAI. SAI previously provided a range of telecommunications solutions to SME customers, including high-speed Internet access, voice, hosting solutions, security, and data protection. Following the acquisition, SAI will be re-branded as the SEACOM KwaZulu-Natal office and will oversee expansion of fibre infrastructure across the region for business customers. SEACOM stated that the acquisition aims to aid its initiative to deliver connectivity and cloud services to enterprise customers along the east coast. “This acquisition allows us to leverage SAI’s expertise, reputation, and local market knowledge, effectively speeding up our regional growth plans in KwaZulu-Natal,” SEACOM CEO Byron Clatterbuck said. “SAI customers and staff will benefit significantly from the resources SEACOM has to offer,” added SAI MD Des Ramsay. “With a connection directly into the heart of the African Internet, user experience will be unsurpassed and SEACOM’s presence in KZN accelerated. “
