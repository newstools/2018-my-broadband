Comsol and Samsung South Africa have launched a live 5G pilot network on Vilakazi Street in Soweto, Johannesburg. Comsol has access to the largest tranche of contiguous 28GHz spectrum in South Africa, making it a front-runner for local 5G services. The pilot network was officially turned on today at a ceremony which drew attendance from several major public figures, including Gauteng Premier David Makhura. Speaking at the event, Comsol CEO Iain Stevenson said the company’s intention is to launch commercial 5G services to businesses and consumers in certain areas in South Africa before the end of 2019. He said this specific pilot network is a 5G “Fixed Wireless Access” solution, consisting of 5G end-to-end hardware solutions provided by Samsung South Africa. Tests on the live 5G network saw download speeds peak at 1.75Gbps, he added. “This opens the doors to a new world, one where ubiquitous, high-speed networks deliver digital services to millions of citizens at low costs,” Stevenson said. The Comsol pilot follows Vodacom showing off a 5G trial earlier in the week, which saw the operator provide download speeds of over 700Mbps.
