Mercedes-Benz has launched its new GLE, which features “a wealth of innovations”. The company said this includes the active suspension system E-ACTIVE, new driver assistance, an optional third seat row, big-screen infotainment system, colour HUD, 4MATIC drive, and the option of a plug-in hybrid model. The GLE will be powered by a new six-cylinder petrol engine, with diesel and hybrid models available at a later date. This provides the GLE 450 4MATIC model with 270kW of power and 500Nm of torque, with a further 250Nm of torque and 16kW available via EQ Boost over short periods. “The integrated starter/alternator (ISG) is responsible for hybrid functions such as EQ Boost or energy recuperation, while allowing fuel savings that were previously reserved for high-voltage hybrid technology,” said Mercedes-Benz. Mercedes-Benz said the 4MATIC all-wheel drive works with this powertrain to provide agile performance on the road, and superior off-road capabilities. “The new Mercedes-Benz GLE will be presented to the public from 4 October 2018. It will be in the dealerships in early 2019 – USA and Europe.”
