iStore has opened pre-orders for the Apple Watch Series 4. The Watch Series 4 boasts a significantly larger screen, over 30% larger, than previous generations – and is also thinner than previous models. Applications have been redesigned to account for the larger display and Apple has included new customisable watch faces. The Watch Series 4 is available in two sizes: 40mm and 44mm. Only the GPS version is available locally, and Apple has not stated if the GPS+Cellular version will launch in South Africa. Silver, Gold, and Space Grey colours are available, along with different band colours and styles. Discovery will also offer the Apple Watch Series 4 to Vitality members, the company told MyBroadband. The table below details the local pricing of the Apple Watch Series 4.
