Cell C did not state that there will only be two cellular networks in South Africa, the company has clarified. The statement follows a report from Business Insider SA which quoted Graham Mackinnon – chief legal officer at Cell C – as saying cellular networks will consolidate into one or two networks in South Africa. “This is not what was said. What was said was: there will be fewer networks globally – consolidation is the way to go because a standalone investment case for the new technologies coming is becoming less viable,” Cell C told MyBroadband. “At no stage did we say that there will be two cellphone networks in South Africa. Service-based competition across shared infrastructure is where the future of telco is going in the world. The WOAN is a reality now and it’s an example of how wholesale network capacity can be provided,” said Cell C. The report further stated that “other telecommunication companies will continue to exist, but will compete on a services level”. Cell C is South Africa’s third-largest cellular network operator by subscriber numbers, with its latest financial results stating its has 16.3 million local customers.
