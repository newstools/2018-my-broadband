Tesla has ended its lifetime Supercharging referral programme, which allowed vehicle owners to grant free Supercharging for life to friends who purchased a Tesla electric vehicle. Users who purchased a Tesla Model S, Model 3, or Model X with a friendâ€™s referral code were previously given free Supercharging for life, but they will now receive $100 Supercharging credit instead. Tesla CEO Elon Musk pointed out the discontinuation of the referral programme on Twitter the day before it ended. Tesla owners who made use of the referral programme can receive rewards depending on their number of qualifying referrals. These range from signature wall connectors and miniature versions of the Tesla Model S, to Powerwall home batteries and VIP invitations to future Tesla product launches.
