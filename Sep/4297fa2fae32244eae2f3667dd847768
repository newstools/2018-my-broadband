South Africans are keen for Black Friday 2018, according to the latest MyBroadband Online Shopping Survey. The survey was taken by 1,268 tech-savvy South Africans – many of whom are MyBroadband readers and forum members. 73% of respondents said they will shop online during Black Friday 2018, which is set to take place in November. Black Friday has proved a great opportunity and a tough challenge for online stores in South Africa, with big sales revenue and websites going offline par for the course for many companies. Takealot, for example, saw R87 million in gross merchandising value last year – but suffered website downtime due to huge demand. The table below shows the answer to the question “Do you plan to shop online during Black Friday 2018?” in the survey. Survey participants were also asked “Have you shopped online at Amazon.com in 2018?”, with the large majority stating “no”. Amazon’s US and Global online store offer many products not available in South Africa, and items at much better prices – even after import and courier charges are taken into account. Many products bought on Amazon and shipped to South Africa, however, are considered gray imports and do not receive warranties and support like their local counterparts do. This, combined with an unease of shipping valuable items in from overseas, may be why local tech-savvy online shoppers have steered clear of Amazon this year. The table below shows the results of the question.
