To open a basic web hosting company is easy – get a dedicated server, build a website with a few shared hosting options, and start promoting your products. However, to offer a top-quality service which scales when you have thousands of domains is far more challenging. There are two South African hosting companies which are synonymous with excellent service levels and customer centricity – Hetzner and Afrihost. Both companies have been in business for two decades and their high customer satisfaction levels saw them grow into hosting powerhouses. These companies offer a wide range of shared hosting and dedicated server plans, aimed at both consumers and businesses. To see how these hosting plans stack up against each other, MyBroadband did a basic hosting price comparison. To measure the value offered by Hetzner and Afrihost, we also added hosting packages from other prominent ISPs. The results of this comparison are below.
