Huawei has revealed its EMUI 9.0 operating system, which is built on Google’s Android 9.0. Speaking at a media event at IFA 2018 in Germany, Huawei president of software engineering Wang Chenglu said EMUI 9.0 is now open for beta testing. “EMUI 9.0 is born from a commitment to creating an enjoyable, consistent, and simple experience,” Chenglu said. “Every change, from consolidating the settings menu, to optimising the performance, to including new digital wellbeing and productivity features, is made to ensure EMUI 9.0 delivers a great, user-friendly experience.” Huawei said EMUI 9.0 delivers a 12.9% increase in system operational performance, with quicker start-up times for applications – including Instagram and Spotify. The operating system also features the second iteration of Huawei’s GPU Turbo technology – GPU Turbo 2.0. This will improve the gaming performance of devices with compatible chipsets and deliver support for a wider selection of games – while also improving efficiency in other areas. The latest version of Huawei’s Android operating system also includes a Password Vault, which allows users to store their encrypted passwords on their device and use their biometric information for authentication. EMUI 9.0 is currently in beta, and registration is open to a selection of compatible devices in Europe. Huawei said EMUI 9.0 will support the latest Huawei devices and additional OS features will become available once the Mate 20 series has launched.
