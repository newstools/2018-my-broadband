Sony has unveiled the PlayStation Classic, a retro console which packs PlayStation games. And by PlayStation games, we mean titles from the first PlayStation – launched almost 25 years ago. The mini console, which is 45% smaller than the original PlayStation, will come preloaded with 20 classic titles, including Final Fantasy VII, Jumping Flash, Ridge Racer Type 4, Tekken 3, and Wild Arms. It also features two controllers based on the original PlayStation design, along with an HDMI connection for modern TVs. The PlayStation Classic is available for pre-order in the US for $99.99, and ships on 3 December 2018.  <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
