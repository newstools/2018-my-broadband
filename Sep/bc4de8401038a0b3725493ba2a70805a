BitCo recently unveiled its fibre-to-the-home products, with packages ranging from 20Mbps to 200Mbps. The new fibre products will feature month-to-month package options, a free-to-use router, and provide uncapped usage. BitCo stated that the fibre packages will initially be offered on Vumatel, with other network providers being considered for the future. BitCo’s new uncapped home fibre offering makes it a direct competitor to the likes of Cool Ideas – a fibre-only ISP which offers uncapped packages across a range of networks. Cool Ideas has consistently featured as the best fibre ISP in South Africa, and has taken the title of top-rated ISP on MyBroadband, first place in the Netflix ISP speed index, and the ISP with the fastest Steam download speeds. To see how BitCo’s new home fibre packages compare to Cool Ideas, we looked at the pricing and speed options on offer. The table below details the uncapped home fibre prices of Cool Ideas and BitCo on Vumatel.
