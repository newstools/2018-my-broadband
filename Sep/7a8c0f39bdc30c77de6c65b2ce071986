Samsung and Apple – when it comes to smartphone battles, there are none bigger. While Apple sells highly-successful MacBook laptops and Mac PCs, and Samsung dominates the memory and storage market, the two companies face off directly in the smartphone market. The battle is a juicy one, thanks to a number of elements. iOS versus Android, and which is the superior operating system. Allowing a device to support microSD storage or not. Fingerprint scanners or only face-scanning authentication. And, of course, the perception of Apple users and the Apple stores which sell the products. Samsung has used this last element as the cornerstone of an online campaign called “Ingenious”, which mocks the “Apple Geniuses” which work in Apple’s stores. Samsung’s Ingenious campaign targets elements of Apple’s iPhone line-up, and mocks them. This includes the “notch” screen introduced with the iPhone X, a lack of multitasking in iOS, storage limitations, fast-charging support, camera performance, and the need for iPhone users to often use a Lightning adapter. The short videos below form part of the Ingenious campaign, and all mock certain elements of Apple’s devices or ecosystem.
