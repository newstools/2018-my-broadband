Euphoria Telecom is proud to have grown its reseller department in recent years. In fact the company has doubled its client base of active resellers in the last 24 months. “The Euphoria system allows you to grow revenue by focusing on services that truly deliver business value for your customers”, says Aidan Smit, head of the Reseller Department at Euphoria Telecom. “We offer a very attractive reseller program to technology/telecommunications businesses that have their own support and sales teams”, he says.  “The bottom line is that you can make up to 30% annuity income on all Euphoria service sales and up to 15% on calls. That’s a great offering and we’re seeing more and more growth because of the winning product and support we provide. Euphoria gives you the tools, technology, training and assistance required to help make your service business successful. It’s as simple as that”. Potential Euphoria resellers are those who: Euphoria Telecom has designed a world-class Cloud PBX system that just works. “But it is you, not Euphoria Telecom, that has the relationship with your customers”, explains Aidan. “Bringing the benefits of our Cloud PBX platform to your customer will strengthen and deepen the trust that they have in you. As a trusted technology advisor, you play the pivotal role of helping your customers get the best out of the Euphoria system”. Sound too good to be true? Well, it’s not. Euphoria Telecom’s lengthy list of happy resellers are testament to that. For more information on the Euphoria Reseller Programme, call Aidan Smit directly on 087 231 0456, or email aidan@euphoria.co.za. *Interested parties should please note that the reseller program does sell SIP Trunks and is not suited to unstaffed businesses that cannot allocate dedicated support resources to manage their customers.
