Telkom has stated that no decision has been taken to offer employees voluntary severance packages. A Telkom spokesperson made the statement to MyBroadband, following an ominous warning from CEO Sipho Maseko and information supplied by a Telkom source. Maseko recently stated that “significant job losses” could take place due to ICASA call termination regulations. “The call termination rate proposal would hit us much harder than our competitors,” said Maseko at the time. “ICASA’s decision to reduce fixed termination rates at a faster rate than the reduction in mobile termination rates when Telkom faces higher costs and supports a large work force in a country with an unemployment rate close to 30% adds additional pressure on the business.” Following the statement from Maseko, a source informed MyBroadband that Telkom was considering offering voluntary severance packages to employees – a process which would start this week. Telkom stated that no decision has been made on the possible move, however. “Sipho Maseko has stated that the proposed regulations on call termination rates, if left unchallenged, may lead to job losses at Telkom. Telkom is in the process of preparing its submission to ICASA and exploring all avenues available to Telkom for this challenge,” Telkom told MyBroadband. “Job losses whether through voluntary separation packages or other means are therefore not a foregone conclusion. Currently, no decision has been made by Telkom to institute voluntary severance packages.”
