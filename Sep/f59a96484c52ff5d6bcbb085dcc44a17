New leaks posted online show what is reported to be new iPhone models – in their new colour options. The red, white, and dark grey models shown are said to be from the iPhone XC line-up. A photo of a pink iPhone, Apple’s Rose Gold variant, with a dual-SIM slot was also posted online, adding to the rumours that Apple will release a dual-SIM version of their smartphone. iPhone models launched in recent years only feature a single SIM slot, and no space for a microSD card. The dual-SIM iPhone may only be sold in markets such as India and China, however, according to reports. The Leakspinner/SlashLeaks photos of the iPhones, posted on Twitter, are shown below. Apple is set to unveil its new iPhones at an event on 12 September 2018.
