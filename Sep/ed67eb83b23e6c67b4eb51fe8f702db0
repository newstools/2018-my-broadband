Well over half of gamers in the United States play games across more than one type of device, according to the 2018 Gamer Segmentation Report. The study was conducted by EEDAR, which is a subsidiary of NPD Group. According to the report, 67% of the 211.2 million Americans aged two and older play on multiple platforms, with 59% of gamers playing on both a mobile device and PC or console. 41% of gamers surveyed only play on a single platform, and mobile is easily the most popular platform in the US. According to the study, 90% of gamers play on their smartphones or tablets. After mobile, PC is the most popular gaming platform, with 52% of gamers playing on either a desktop or laptop PC. 43% of US gamers play on consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, and only 9% play games on handheld systems. When it comes to time spent playing games, the study found that gamers spent an average of 12 hours per week gaming. “Over the past several years, mobile gamers have been a key segment for the games industry to target with marketing spend because of the sheer size and diversity of the audience,” said EEDAR. “While there continues to be opportunity for growth in mobile, the real potential for growth lies with getting the other groups increasingly involved in gaming across platforms that they may not have considered using for gaming in the past.”
