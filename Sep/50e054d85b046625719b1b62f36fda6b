Smartphone manufacturer OnePlus is now developing a smart TV, according to a forum post by CEO Pete Lau. OnePlus has built eight flagship smartphones over the past five years, and Lau said the company is now ready to expand into new markets. “In continuing our relentless exploration of improving the world around us, we would like to take the first step in building a connected human experience,” Lau said. He said the new device would be named OnePlus TV, and would focus on creating a product which is focused on smart home integration. “To do this, we are building a new product of OnePlus’ premium flagship design, image quality, and audio experience to more seamlessly connect the home.” “We believe your TV has the potential to be so much more than where you watch your favorite shows,” added Lau. Lau did not reveal any information regarding the current stage of development of the OnePlus TV.
