WhatsApp is the main channel of communication for many South Africans, letting them stay in touch with family and friends, share photos, and make voice calls. WhatsApp has become so widespread that SMS traffic has rapidly declined in recent years, with mobile users ditching more expensive SMS messaging for the messaging platform. WhatsApp can, however, use a lot of data – and cost you money – when it is used to share large photos, videos, or make video calls. This can become costly if you do not have a large data bundle, which makes mobile data usage more affordable. Good news for those who cannot afford large data bundles is that three mobile operators – Cell C, Vodacom, and MTN – offer standalone WhatsApp data bundles at lower rates than standard data bundles. Cell C, Vodacom, and MTN’s WhatsApp data bundles offer capped data use on WhatsApp for certain periods at a reduced data rate. Most WhatsApp services are included in the data bundles offered, excluding voice and video calling – as shown in the relevant terms and conditions below. The table below provides an overview of the WhatsApp data bundles available from local mobile operators.
