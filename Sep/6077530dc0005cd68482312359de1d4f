DStv and Showmax announced in September 2017 that DStv Premium subscribers would get Showmax bundled with their DStv account for free. Showmax, which is R99 per month, offers an online streaming service that competes against the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime. When Showmax launched the special for DStv Premium subscribers, it stated in its terms and conditions that the free subscription would end on 31 March 2019. “This offer terminates 31 March 2019, after which the prevailing monthly rate for Showmax will prevail,” stated the terms and conditions. There have been many big moves at MultiChoice since the launch of the free Showmax promotion. Two which stand out are the establishment of the Connected Video unit and the plan to list the MultiChoice Group on the JSE. The Connected Video unit will run the Showmax and DStv Now services in South Africa. It will also be responsible for developing new over-the-top services for the MultiChoice group. In terms of the MultiChoice Group, the new company “will be named MultiChoice Group and will include MultiChoice South Africa, MultiChoice Africa, Showmax Africa, and Irdeto”. To see if MultiChoice’s free Showmax promotion was affected by the moves, we spoke to the company about the matter. It stated that, currently, there is no intention to change the expiration date. “But depending how our OTT products evolve, we could look at a different approach,” it said. Any decision will be made closer to the time.
