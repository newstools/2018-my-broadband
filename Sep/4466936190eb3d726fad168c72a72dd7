Discovery will offer the Apple Watch Series 4 to Vitality members, the company told MyBroadband. Craig Nossel, Head of Vitality Wellness, said the exact structure of the offering will be worked on by the company. Discovery currently offers previous versions of the Apple Watch to Vitality members through a discount scheme. Vitality Active Rewards lets users work towards activity goals which then dictate their associated watch repayments. When Apple launched the Watch Series 4 this month, it introduced a host of new features to the device. These include three new heart monitoring features: The Series 4 also includes a next-generation accelerometer and gyroscope combination, which enables a new feature on the device that allows it to detect when the wearer accidentally falls. Nossel told MyBroadband that Discovery is looking into the ECG technology and how it can be incorporated into its systems. “Technologies like this provide great opportunities for us to have an even bigger impact on people’s health. While the technology itself is exciting, when it is integrated into a broader health and wellness system, the benefits are maximised,” said Nossel. Nossel added that Discovery also recognises that falls are a significant risk amongst the elderly population. “We will continue to look at ways of preventing falls, but again, integrating this into our ecosystem will make perfect sense,” he said about the Watch Series 4’s capabilities.
