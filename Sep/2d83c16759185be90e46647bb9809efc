Apple’s new iPhones pack an array of upgrades and features – including dual-SIM support, which Rain Mobile is interested in supporting. The iPhone dual-SIM functionality is not enabled in the typical manner, however – two physical SIM cards in one phone. With two SIM card trays in a device, a user can buy a SIM card from MTN and Rain, for example, and use both in their smartphone. A popular option if for one SIM to be set as the default number for calls and SMSs, while the other is used for mobile data. Apple’s new iPhones do not work like this, however, and instead use Dual-SIM Dual-Standby which consists of one physical nano-SIM card slot and one eSIM. An eSIM is an embedded SIM card which is built into the device and needs to be enabled by a mobile network to function as a second SIM. This requires the likes of Vodacom and MTN to support eSIM technology for your new iPhone’s dual-SIM capabilities to work. Following the launch of the new iPhones, users were quick to ask whether Rain Mobile will support the technology. With no contracts or bundles, and data at an effective flat rate of R50 per GB, Rain Mobile is an attractive option as the “data SIM” in a dual-SIM smartphone. Rain told MyBroadband it believes the use of dual-SIM phones, both physical and eSIM, are likely to increase significantly in South Africa in the future. “We will certainly be engaging with Apple to see if we can support their eSIM functionality in iPhones,” said Rain. “We believe that enabling the second SIM in an iPhone to use the Rain network for data will be a great customer proposition,” it added. “This is particularly true if customers chose our R250-per-month unlimited off-peak data option. Overall, iPhone users would be able to dramatically lower their data costs.”
