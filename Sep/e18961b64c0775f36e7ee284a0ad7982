MultiChoice’s contract with the Afro Worldview news channel, formerly ANN7, expired on 20 August. As a result, the channel is no longer broadcast on DStv. A new 24-hour news channel called Newzroom Afrika has won a bid to replace Afro Worldview on DStv. No launch date for the new channel has been announced, but the channel’s cofounders said they hope to be on air by early 2019. This is but one of many changes to DStv’s channels in recent times, as shown below. To show users the latest differences between Premium, Compact Plus, and Compact from a channel perspective, we have created comparison tables below. The price differences and number of channels per package are also listed in a separate table. DStv Premium, Compact Plus, and Compact also have access to the decoder-based versions of DStv Catch Up and BoxOffice, provided you pay the additional R90-per-month Access Fee. They also have access to DStv Now, which offers streaming of their respective channels through web browsers, and the DStv Now apps. To see how the top three packages compare, we listed the channels common to them in the table below. The channels available on higher packages are then listed further down. DStv Compact Plus and Premium include the channels listed above, plus the following 19 channels. DStv Premium features the channels listed above, plus the following 21 channels.
