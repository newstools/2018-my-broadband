A university professor has conducted a test of YouTube’s Content ID system with uploads of classical music, and found that copyright owners were incorrectly flagging uploads while Google was unresponsive to requests for support, TorrentFreak reported. Professor Ulrich Kaiser, University of Music and Performing Arts Munich, recently launched a YouTube channel called Labeltest after the video platform flagged old recordings of classical music he uploaded. Kaiser uploaded 10 videos to the channel which featured music by Beethoven, Wagner, and Schubert. The youngest recording was made in 1963. All the videos were flagged by Content ID, and Kaiser challenged the claims – asserting his rights under German law by stating that the composers were all dead – and the copyrights had expired. Eight of the objections resulted in the copyright claim being lifted, but Deutsche Grammophon/UMG insisted that its copyright on two of the recordings remained valid. Attempts to obtain support from Google were futile, Kaiser said. Sending emails to the address Google lists to obtain support yields a response which states mails “cannot be read or registered” at that address. Email forms on the Google support website also do not enable contact with YouTube staff members.
