MTN recently announced changes to the pricing and sizing of its WhatsApp bundles. From 1 October 2018, MTN’s daily and weekly WhatsApp bundles will be amended to include more data at higher prices. “While our pricing has increased, we were mindful of ensuring that our offering remained competitive and affordable. In line with this, both offerings still provide great value in the market,” said MTN. To see how the changes affect the bundles’ position relative to the competition, we looked at what Cell C and Vodacom have to offer along with MTN’s new pricing and data allocations. Telkom launched a 1GB WhatsApp bundle for R15, where the data lasts for 30 days, in July 2018, but this was a promotional offer which has ended. The table below shows the best WhatsApp bundles available on local networks, detailing their price and validity.
