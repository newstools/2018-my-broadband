Microsoft has announced that corporate customers using Windows 7 will be able to pay for extended security update support until 2023. “As previously announced, Windows 7 extended support is ending January 14, 2020,” said Microsoft. “We will offer paid Windows 7 Extended Security Updates (ESU) through January 2023. The Windows 7 ESU will be sold on a per-device basis and the price will increase each year. Windows 7 ESUs will be available to all Windows 7 Professional and Windows 7 Enterprise customers in Volume Licensing, with a discount to customers with Windows software assurance, Windows 10 Enterprise, or Windows 10 Education subscriptions,” it said. “In addition, Office 365 ProPlus will be supported on devices with active Windows 7 Extended Security Updates through January 2023. This means that customers who purchase the Windows 7 ESU will be able to continue to run Office 365 ProPlus.” Recent data from NetMarketShare showed that Windows 7 is still the most popular desktop operating system in the world, despite concerted efforts from Microsoft to get users to upgrade to Windows 10. Windows 10 is in second place and closing in on top spot, however.
