The SABC recently announced that it will embark on a retrenchment process as part of its strategy to address the financial mess it finds itself in. The state broadcaster reported a loss of R622 million for the year ended 31 March 2018, following an even bigger loss the year before. The SABC said it has been forced to lay off workers due to its financial situation and high salary costs, as it is struggling to fund its R3.1-billion annual wage bill. These plans did not sit well with ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule, who said the organisation must support the workers of SABC. “The ANC has taken a decision and I’m talking on behalf of the President that we must not allow any retrenchments even in our SOE’s same with SABC – we should not allow people to be retrenched,” he said. The SABC board hit back after Magashule’s comments, saying it noted statements by the ANC “with concern”. According to the SABC, Magashule’s comment has caused confusion among its employees and other stakeholders. SABC spokesperson Neo Momodu highlighted that its board has the exclusive power to “control the affairs of the corporation”. “This includes how the SABC operates the business of the public broadcaster and conducts labour relations with its employees,” she said. The SABC board has assured employees and stakeholders that it will “continue to uphold its fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the corporation”.
