Apple has launched its new smartphones, the iPhone Xs, Xs Max, and Xr. The Xs and Xs Max are Apple’s most advanced iPhones to date, and feature powerful new processors and cameras. An upgraded IP rating – IP68 – has also been included, along with storage options up to 512GB. The Xs and Xs Max are positioned as the new flagship iPhones, with 5.8-inch and 6.5-inch OLED displays respectively, while the iPhone Xr is the “more affordable” option. This makes the iPhone Xs and Xs Max direct competitors to the recently-launched Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+. The Samsung Galaxy S9 and iPhone Xs are very similar and very different at the same time. Their operating systems – Android and iOS – are the primary difference, and the ecosystems they tie in to and support typically determine which device a user will choose. The smartphones share many similarities, though. Both have 5.8-inch OLED displays, both weigh around 170g, and both have an IP68 rating. LTE, Wi-Fi, NFC, and Bluetooth connectivity are also shared, but the physical ports are different – USB-C for Samsung and Lightning for Apple. Biometric security on the Samsung includes fingerprint, iris, and face scanning, while the iPhone only supports Face ID. The specifications of the devices are shown below.  As with the smartphones above, the iPhone Xs Max and Galaxy S9+ share many similarities. They are both plus-size versions in their respective ranges and feature 6.2-inch and 6.5-inch OLED displays respectively. Both have dual-12MP camera systems, high storage capacities, and an IP68 rating against dust and water. Besides the operating system difference, the notch display design on the iPhone is the standout physical differentiator. As before, the biometric security of the Samsung features fingerprint, face, and iris recognition, while the iPhone relies on Face ID.  Note: Apple does not disclose iPhone RAM and battery specifications.
