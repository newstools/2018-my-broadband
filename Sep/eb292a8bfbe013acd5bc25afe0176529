Alibaba will launch its own AI inference chip in the second half of 2018, Reuters reports. Speaking at an event in Hangzhou, China, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma said the company would set up a dedicated chip subsidiary to build chips designed for autonomous driving, smart cities, and logistics. Alibaba’s new chip subsidiary will reportedly also be used to develop embedded chipsets to support the company’s IoT and cloud businesses. This follows the company acquiring Chinese microchip manufacturer Hangzhou C-SKY Microsystems earlier this year to boost its cloud-based IoT business. Alibaba has also been integrating its digital assistant into Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Volvo vehicles in China to improve its AliGenie connected ecosystem.
