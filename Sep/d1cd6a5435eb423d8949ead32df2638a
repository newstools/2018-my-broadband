The Canadian Supreme Court has ruled that Internet service providers are entitled to compensation when they track down pirates for studios. An Engadget report stated that Voltage Pictures – which produced The Hurt Locker – planned to sue 55,000 users who were Rogers customers for pirating the movie. Rogers, a telecoms company, then stated it would charge a fee of $100 per hour to track down the IP addresses and users. The matter ended up in the Supreme Court after Voltage Pictures said the fee would make it too expensive for it to track down the alleged pirates. The court did not agree with the statement, however, noting that media companies could cause ISPs to incur costs with big user data requests. Rogers must now go to a lower court to prove its costs.
