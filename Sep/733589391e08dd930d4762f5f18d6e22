As part of the celebration of its five-year anniversary in South Africa, Uber has highlighted the career of one of its drivers. Matthew is an Uber driver who has racked up over 30,000 trips on the platform over the course of three years, said the company. Some of his most notable trips include speeding a pregnant woman to the hospital to give birth, to simply driving his parents or children home. Matthew has bought and fully paid for three vehicles during his time with Uber and now employs two other Uber drivers. “I always knew I wanted more in life, I wanted to travel and explore, discover and learn. I knew that an office job was not for me,” said Matthew. “From my riders, I’ve felt like I’ve explored the world. For me, the riders are my tickets into new countries.” Matthew hails from Nigeria and moved to South Africa in 2006.
