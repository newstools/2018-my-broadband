The upcoming OnePlus 6T smartphone will have an in-screen fingerprint sensor, CNET reports. OnePlus confirmed the hardware feature in an email to CNET, branding its in-display fingerprint reader solution as Screen Unlock. “By adding this feature as an addition to other display unlocking options such as Face Unlock, users will have options to unlock the display in a way that is most efficient for them,” the company said. The technology comprises an optical sensor embedded underneath an OLED panel, which illuminates and reads the user’s fingerprint when they place their finger on the display. In-screen fingerprint sensors have become more common on high-end devices of late, such as Huawei’s Mate RS Porsche Design. The OnePlus 6T is expected to launch in October 2018 and will reportedly be priced at around $550.
