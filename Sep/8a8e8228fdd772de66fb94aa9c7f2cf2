Lyft, Uber’s big competitor in the US, is expanding its Ditch Your Car promotion in the country. “We spend so much time, money, and effort driving around cities. Wouldn’t it be great if we could leave our cars at home sometimes?,” asked Lyft. The programme lets individuals sign up for the challenge, which puts them in line to win $300 Lyft shared credit, one month Zipcar membership and $100 drive credit, and a one-month MARTA pass. Zipcar is a car-sharing company, while the MARTA pass offers access to mass transit services. The idea is that with the credit and access to transport services, people will not have to use their own cars. “We are on the brink of a massive shift in personal transportation, moving away from ownership and into transportation as a service,” said Lyft.
