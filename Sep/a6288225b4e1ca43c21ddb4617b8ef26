MTN Supersonic recently launched its first fibre-to-the-home products, promising a reliable and cost-effective connectivity solution. Supersonic plans to differentiate itself from other fibre Internet service providers through a “simplicity, reliability, stability, and agility” strategy. Another key differentiator is all its fibre options are uncapped, with prices starting at R658 per month. With so many ISPs competing in the fibre-to-the-home market, it raises the question as to which providers offer the best value for money. With many different fibre providers and products in the market, it can be challenging to accurately compare prices. To solve this problem, MyBroadband looked at the prices of uncapped symmetrical 100Mbps FTTH services offered over Vumatel’s fibre infrastructure. It is, however, not only price that matters. Network quality, support, and reliability all play a role in customer satisfaction. MyBroadband’s speed test ISP rating therefore provides a good indication of how happy subscribers are with their ISP. The table below provides an overview of prices and the customer satisfaction ratings of prominent fibre service providers, as ranked by MyBroadband’s speed test ISP rating.
