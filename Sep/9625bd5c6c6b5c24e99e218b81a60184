The Apple iPhone Xs and Xs Max are available for pre-order from Technomobi. The two smartphones in the Xs series comprise similar features, such as Super Retina displays, fast Face ID, the smartest, most powerful chip in a smartphone, and a breakthrough dual-camera system – all in a custom developed, surgical-grade steel body which is available in three finishes – including a new gold colour. The iPhone Xs sports a 5.8-inch OLED display – which is as big as the iPhone 8 Plus, but in a smaller body – and delivers the most accurate colour in the industry, while the iPhone Xs Max comes with a 6.5-inch OLED display – the largest ever on an iPhone. Both devices include an upgraded IP68 resistance rating for improved water and dust resistance, along with the most durable glass ever developed for a smartphone. The iPhones also offer facial recognition with Face ID functionality, enabled by the true-depth camera system, which let users log in with only a glance. The devices are powered by the intelligent A12 Bionic 7nm chip – the smartest, most powerful chip ever in a smartphone, offering up to 50% more graphics processing power – and packs a Neural Engine which dedicates machine learning to everything from augmented reality to photography. Both smartphones also deliver Gigabit-class LTE for superfast download speeds and up to 512GB of storage, making it the highest-capacity iPhones yet. The online retailer stated that pre-orders for the iPhone Xs start at R22,699, while the iPhone Xs Max start at R24,999. Pre-orders for the iPhone Xs and Xs Max start on 21 September, while the official launch will take place on 28 September.
