Apple broke FaceTime for users who were refusing to upgrade to iOS 7 in April 2014, The Register reported, citing court documents. iOS 7 introduced a key change to the way FaceTime worked, and the report stated that supporting the technology for iOS 6 was costing Apple money. Many iPhone 4 users did not wish to upgrade to iOS 7, saying that the new operating system made their devices slower. In a lawsuit brought against Apple, plaintiffs alleged that the company deliberately broke FaceTime in iOS 6 to encourage users to upgrade. Apple said that the issue was a bug at the time, and denied that it broke the functionality. As a counter to Apple’s claim, the report stated the company allowed a digital certificate to expire prematurely, which caused FaceTime to stop working on devices that didn’t use iOS 7. Over the course of the 18-month court case, Apple argued its terms of service allow it to make whatever changes it sees fit to its phones. The judge did not accept Apple’s argument. A class action against Apple can now be pursued.
