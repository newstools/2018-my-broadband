Chronicle, a cybersecurity company and subsidiary of Alphabet, has announced the upcoming launch of VirusTotal Enterprise. Google bought VirusTotal in September 2012. It formed Alphabet in August 2015, and reworked its corporate structure so that VirusTotal would fall under Chronicle. “VirusTotal Enterprise combines existing capabilities, expanded functionality including improved YARA threat hunting, and new features such as Private Graph and high-speed searching through a new interface that unifies capabilities in our free and paid sites,” Chronicle announced. YARA is an open-source tool designed to help malware researchers identify and classify malware samples. “VirusTotal Enterprise allows users to search for malware samples (using VT Intelligence), hunt for future malware samples (using VT Hunt with YARA), analyse malware relationships (using VT Graph), and automate all these tasks with our API,” Chronicle said. “VT Private Graph adds new capabilities that enable customers to represent their internal infrastructure and users within a graph, all while keeping your most sensitive investigations private.” Chronicle said it will roll out all of these features in the coming weeks.
