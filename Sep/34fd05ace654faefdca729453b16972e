Renault plans to develop a smart electric ecosystem for the French island of Belle-Île-en-Mer, turning it into France’s first “smart island”. The automaker unveiled its new project in partnership with a number of energy companies, with its aim being the facilitation of energy transition on the French island. The project will also involve a fleet of Renault Zoe and Kangoo vehicles running on a ride-sharing service. These vehicles will be charged by EV chargers, which in turn will be powered by solar panels placed on the roofs of buildings. Renault plans to implement these initial renewable energy measures and scale up its solution as it improves in the field, potentially granting it the knowledge to address mainland challenges with a similar approach.
