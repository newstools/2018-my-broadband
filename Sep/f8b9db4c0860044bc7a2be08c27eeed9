Apple’s new iPhone Xs smartphones are launching this week, and third-party benchmark data for the devices has been published. Initial figures show that Apple’s new 7nm A12 Bionic processor packs a hefty performance boost, giving it a clear edge over last year’s iPhone X. Apple’s new iPhone Xr is also set to release in the coming weeks, and benchmark data is now available. While the iPhone Xr is the more-affordable smartphone in the line-up, it includes the 7nm A12 Bionic processor. Performance data from third-party benchmarking tool Geekbench shows that the new iPhones are the most powerful smartphones in the world. While the iPhone X enjoyed superior performance to its Android rivals, the new iPhones easily pull ahead of its record-breaking scores. Interestingly, Geekbench data shows the iPhone Xr boasting better benchmark scores than the Xs and Xs Max. This may be due to less overhead thanks to its lower display specifications. The Samsung Galaxy S9, OnePlus 6, and LG G7 ThinQ are comprehensively defeated by the iPhones. Huawei smartphones are omitted from the Geekbench rankings. The Geekbench benchmark scores for the new iPhones and competing Android devices are below. The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is not included in Geekbench’s results, but independent Geekbench tests conducted by Tom’s Guide found that it scored around 8,876 – just below the OnePlus 6. Tom’s Guide also found that app open time and video editing performance was substantially better on the new iPhones than on Android flagships. Apple’s iPhone Xs Max transcoded a two-minute 4K clip to 1080p in 39 seconds, while the Samsung Galaxy S9+ performed the same task in two minutes and 32 seconds – the fastest score for an Android device.
