Comic Con Africa took place at the Kyalami Convention Centre from 14-16 September 2018, and featured a range of international stars as guests. The event was sold out, and provided attendees with the opportunity to have photos with their favourite stars, check out the latest in comic book and movie memorabilia, watch cosplayers show off their outfits, and more. There was also gaming action taking place at the event, with Telkom VS Gaming hosting its Masters and Championships tournaments at the show. MyBroadband attended the event, and took photos of the action to show you what went down. Photos of Comic Con Africa 2018 are posted below.
