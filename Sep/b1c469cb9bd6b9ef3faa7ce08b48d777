Red Dead Redemption 2 is set to release at the end of October, but its online multiplayer mode will only arrive in November. The multiplayer mode will initially be available as a public beta, and Rockstar Games conceded it expects some minor issues following the launch of the service due to its size and scale. “Red Dead Online is an evolution of the classic multiplayer experience in the original Red Dead Redemption, blending narrative with competitive and cooperative gameplay in fun new ways,” Rockstar Games said in a blog post. “Using the gameplay of the upcoming Red Dead Redemption 2 as a foundation, Red Dead Online will be ready to be explored alone or with friends, and will also feature constant updates and adjustments to grow and evolve this experience for all players.” Access to Red Dead Online will be free to all users who own Red Dead Redemption 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game is set to launch on these consoles on 26 October 2018.
