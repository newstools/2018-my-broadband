Fortnite developer Epic Games announced that the battle-royale title has been installed by 15 million Android users since launch. The application reached the figure in the first 21 days after Fortnite was officially launched on the mobile platform. Fortnite on Android is in an invite-only phase, and Epic Games noted that its conversion from invited users to active players is similar to that of the previous iOS beta. Epic Games noted that enabling cross-play between Android, PC, and console was a major technical challenge and required a unique approach to environment rendering. The developer said it worked directly with Samsung and Google engineers to optimise and build the Android version of the game, in addition to other partners such as ARM, Qualcomm, and HiSilicon. “Working with partners has been crucial to bringing Fortnite to Android. Without their knowledge, expertise, and hard work it would not have been possible,” said Epic Games.
