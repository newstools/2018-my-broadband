Tesla has listed its Qi-certified wireless smartphone charger on its website, following its launch last month. The device sold out after its initial listing, but Tesla has brought it back and is offering it at a cheaper price – now $49. Previously, it was $65. Tesla’s charger features a 6,000mAh battery that can charge at 5W, and allows user to place compatible smartphones on the device to let them charge. Users are also able to charge devices via a USB-A port or its integrated USB-C cable. “Due to high demand, please allow 3-4 weeks for shipment,” said Tesla.
