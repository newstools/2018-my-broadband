Elon Musk has smoked marijuana in an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan, which was broadcast live. The interview lasted over two hours and saw the Tesla CEO speaking with Rogan about a range of subjects, including the dangers of artificial intelligence and the problems with discourse on social media platforms. Towards the end of the broadcast, Rogan lit up a large marijuana-and-tobacco-filled cigarette and offered it to Musk. “You probably can’t do this because of stockholders, right?” Rogan asked Musk, as he offered him the joint. “I mean it’s legal, right?,” Musk responded, as he accepted the joint and took a puff. Marijuana consumption is legal in the state of California, where the podcast was hosted.
