Logitech has launched a new keyboard aimed at smart TV users. The K600 TV Keyboard features an integrated touchpad and D-pad, along with a full keyboard. “The keyboard includes an accurate touchpad and D-pad so you can really use the web browser of the TV, enter text to search for the content you want to watch, and navigate media content in your favorite video and streaming applications,” said Logitech. After users have connected the keyboard’s dongle to their TV, they are provided with 15 metres of wireless range. Samsung, LG, and Sony Bravia TVs are currently compatible with the device. Logitech said the keyboard is priced at $69.99 in the US.
