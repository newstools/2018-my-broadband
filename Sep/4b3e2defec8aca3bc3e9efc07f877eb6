Microsoft will enable mouse and keyboard support on Xbox One in the coming weeks. The feature will be available to select Xbox Insiders, said the company. “Developers can now build mouse and keyboard support in their games if and how they choose. It’s important to note that mouse and keyboard support for games is added on a title-by-title basis, entirely at developers’ discretion,” said Microsoft. “For all other titles, nothing changes. Mouse and keyboard input is not enabled by default for games,” it added. The company stated that most wired or wireless USB keyboards and mice will work on Xbox One, and it has partnered with Razer on the project. “Tune into the November 10 edition of Inside Xbox for more details about additional titles supporting mouse and keyboard.”
