While peer-to-peer file sharing has been declining thanks to the popularity of services such Netflix, TorrentFreak reports that BitTorrent traffic is on the rise. Citing data from Sandvine, the report stated there is a clear upward trend in BitTorrent traffic in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). The report noted that globally, file sharing makes up 3% of all download traffic and 22% of all upload traffic. BitTorrent accounts for the vast majority (over 97%) of all upstream file sharing traffic. In EMEA, BitTorrent is 32% of all upstream traffic. The company said that fragmentation of the subscription video-on-demand market is likely playing a significant role in the increase in torrent traffic around the world. In the US, HBO has Game of Thrones, Netflix has House of Cards, Hulu has The Handmaid’s Tale, and Amazon has Jack Ryan, for example. The market is similarly fragmented in South Africa, where Showmax has Game of Thrones, Netflix has originals like Stranger Things, and Amazon has American Gods. This can result in users pirating content.
