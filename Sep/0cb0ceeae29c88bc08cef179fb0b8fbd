SwiftKey now offers real-time message translation on Android thanks to new integration with Microsoft Translator. This lets users translate message on their SwiftKey Keyboard, without leaving the conversation. “Today’s update on SwiftKey for Android makes it easy to not only understand messages you receive, but also translate outgoing messages – making sure your message is understood every time,” said SwiftKey. Over 60 languages are supported, and installing Microsoft Translator allows users to use the feature offline. The video below provides a brief overview of the functionality. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
