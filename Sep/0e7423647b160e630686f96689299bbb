Nigeria’s central bank recently demanded that MTN return up to $8.1 billion in dividends which it moved out of the country. The central bank has also fined a number of banks including Standard Bank, Stanbic, Citigroup, and Diamond Bank for their role in facilitating the movement of these funds out of the country. According to a report in the Sunday Times, industry analysts have labelled the demands a “shakedown” of the banks which will have a negative effect on Nigeria’s unstable banking sector. Stanbic has stated that it is not a beneficiary of any remittance made on behalf of clients and denied that it acted illegally in facilitating MTN’s movement of dividends out of Nigeria. A source close to the bank told the Sunday Times that the central bank’s demands are concerning as it did not ask for the money to be returned to the company which it originated from. “The odd thing in all of this is that the [central bank] wrote to the banks and to MTN, but they don’t say the money must be refunded to the company that paid it, they say it must be refunded to the central bank,” said the source. Deloitte MD of emerging markets and Africa Martyn Davies reportedly stated that while the Nigerian administration was initially regarded as friendly, it has turned out to be hostile towards business. “It’s not just the fine, but the exorbitant nature of these fines,” Davies said. “$8.1 billion is bigger than a large number of African country GDPs.” Speaking to the Sunday Times, an MTN source said the operator would not consider leaving the Nigerian market, however. MTN’s share price dropped substantially after Nigeria issued the order to return the $8.1 billion, which it said was illegally expatriated. The company’s share price plunged a total of 17% over the past week following the news of the Nigerian central bank’s demands. Nigeria is MTN’s biggest market and is home to more than 54 million customers out of the company’s 221 million customers worldwide.
