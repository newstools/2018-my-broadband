Google is cracking down on tech support adverts to ensure it maintains a “healthy advertising ecosystem”. The company stated that it will protect people from misleading, inappropriate, and harmful ads. “We have teams of engineers, policy experts, product managers, and others who wage a daily fight against bad actors,” said Google. “Just last year alone, we took down more than 3.2 billion ads that violated our advertising policies – that’s more than 100 bad ads per second.” In a big to fight tech support scams, Google is rolling out a verification programme “to ensure that only legitimate providers of third-party tech support can use our platform to reach consumers”. “There’s more to do, and we’ll continue committing the resources necessary to keep the online advertising ecosystem a safe place for everyone.”
