Roku has launched a new streaming player, the Roku Premiere. The device is available in two versions – Roku Premiere ($39.99) and Roku Premiere+ ($49.99), with the “plus” a Walmart exclusive. The player offers support for 4K HDR, Dolby and DTS Digital Surround support, quad-core processors, a remote control and HDMI cable, and provides 802.11 Wi-Fi connectivity. The Premiere+ offers the same features as the Premiere, in addition to a voice remote with TV power and volume buttons. “At under $40, the new Roku Premiere is our lowest-priced 4K streaming player ever, and it’s going to give consumers the best picture quality their TV can handle,” said Roku. “Compact and power-packed, you’ll stream all your favourites with ease. From movies and series on Netflix and Prime Video, to cable alternatives like Sling TV, access the most talked about TV across free and paid channels.”
