Google has launched a fundraising campaign for Hurricane Florence relief efforts, and is offering to match donations of up to $1 million to the American Red Cross. “We have chosen to direct our support to the Red Cross because of their strong track record and existing response. We will not match donations to other organisations,” Google stated. “Your donation enables the American Red Cross to respond and help people recover from this disaster. The Red Cross needs financial donations to be able to provide immediate relief to communities impacted by Hurricane Florence.” There are no limits to the amount of times people may donate, said Google. Hurricane Florence has killed at least 33 people since hitting the US mainland.
