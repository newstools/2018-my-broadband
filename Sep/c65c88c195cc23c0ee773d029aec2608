Twitter director of product management Sara Haider announced that the company is testing new features aimed at making the platform more conversational. These changes include the addition of threaded conversations and status indicators. The threaded conversations change the way nested replies are shown within the platform’s interface, bringing them more in line with comments on other platforms such as Facebook. Twitter is also testing a “presence” feature, which will show whether users are currently active by display a green indicator next to their profile picture. Haider did not state when these new features are expected to roll out to users on the social media platform, but said that the changes were still in early development and encouraged Twitter users to provide feedback on the features. hey Twitter. we've been playing with some rough features to make it feel more conversational here. presence and reply threading. still early and iterating on these ideas. thoughts? pic.twitter.com/3U3NvpHWPy — Sara Haider (@pandemona) August 31, 2018
