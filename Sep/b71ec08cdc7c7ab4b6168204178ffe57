Microsoft has pulled the Chrome and Firefox browser warning in Windows 10, following an outcry from users. The latest Windows 10 Insider preview build included a pop-up warning when users attempted to install Google Chrome or Firefox. Upon opening the installation program for either of these browsers, Windows 10 opened a window which warned against installing the browser – stating that users “already have Microsoft Edge – the safer, faster browser for Windows 10”. A new report by The Verge states that Microsoft is now reversing its decision to include this warning. The warning will therefore not appear in the upcoming Windows 10 October 2018 Update.
