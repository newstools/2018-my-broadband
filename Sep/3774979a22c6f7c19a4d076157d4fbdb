Liberty has told MyBroadband that its investigation into a recent IT security breach is ongoing, and the company is working with authorities on the matter. “Liberty can confirm that the matter of the illegal and unauthorised access to its IT infrastructure by an external party is still subject to a criminal investigation and we are working with the relevant authorities,” said Liberty. “Following the incident we proactively contacted all impacted employees and customers and reiterate that no customer has suffered any financial loss as a result of this unfortunate incident.” “Liberty remains in full control of its IT environment following significant steps to further secure our systems.” “Liberty will update all relevant stakeholders on the outcome of the investigation as more information becomes available.” Liberty Holdings CEO David Munro stated in June 2018 that hackers had attacked its IT infrastructure and gained access to the company’s mailing service. Munro stated that the data affected by the hack consisted largely of recent emails. It was also limited to Liberty’s operations in South Africa. Munro said no clients had suffered financial losses as a result of the attack, and the company’s policies and transactions remained in place. He added that the identity of the hackers was being investigated, and that an extortion attempt against the company was made.
