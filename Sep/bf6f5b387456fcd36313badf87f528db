Google has stated it will not drop the “www” in Chrome just yet, after the company looked at restructuring URLs in the browser. On the Chromium page, the company stated in Chrome 69 they rolled out a change to “hide special-case subdomains www and m in the Chrome omnibox”. “After receiving community feedback about these changes, we have decided to roll back these changes in M69 on Chrome for Desktop and Android.” In Chrome 70, however, an adjusted version will omit “www” but not “m”. “We are not going to elide m in M70 because we found large sites that have a user-controlled m subdomain. There is more community consensus that sites should not allow the www subdomain to be user controlled.” The page stated that a public standardisation discussion will be initiated with the “appropriate standards bodies to explicitly reserve www or m as special case subdomains under-the-hood.”
