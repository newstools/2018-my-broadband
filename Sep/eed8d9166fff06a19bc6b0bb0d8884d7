Mozilla has announced that former Google executive Alan Davidson will assume the role of VP of Global Policy, Trust, and Security at the company. “Alan will add considerable capacity to our public policy, trust, and security efforts, drawing from his extensive professional history working to advance a free and open digital economy,” Mozilla said. Davidson will be responsible for heading up Mozilla’s public policy work and will supervise a trust and security team – which will promote the direction of privacy and security features. “For over 15 years, Mozilla has been a driving force for a free and open Internet, building open source products with industry-leading privacy and security features, said Davidson. “I am thrilled to be joining an organisation so committed to putting the user first, and to making technology a force for good in people’s lives.” Davidson has previously worked with Mozilla as a Tech Policy Fellow.
