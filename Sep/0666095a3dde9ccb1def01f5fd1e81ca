When buying to let or renting out property, both landlords and tenants can expect to face a variety of challenges somewhere along the way. For landlords, these challenges often include property management tasks – such as dealing with complaints, damage to property, and keeping tenants happy. Despite setting up comprehensive contracts with rules and regulations stipulated to make the landlord’s job easier, tenants (and landlords) don’t always adhere to them. According to Mobile at Work – a solutions provider and systems integrator – the greatest encompassing frustration for both parties is communication, especially when incidents occur. In the case where property is leased for business purposes, even minor disruptions can have a huge impact on company operations. Taking the latter into consideration, Mobile at Work identified the need for a property incident management solution. To aid poor communication between tenants and their landlords, Mobile at Work has designed a solution called NotifyUs – a PropTech solution that allows for easy communication between tenants and landlords, and introduces transparency to easier resolve possible issues. Using integrated SmartNote technology, NotifyUs allows users to capture incident details for any topic by combining photos, comments, and feedback from multiple people into a collaborative group. Sending SmartNotes promotes communication between landlords and tenants to fast-tracks problem solving, as it allows everyone involved to see exactly who said what, when, and where. SmartNote can be used as an internal document – being emailed to a relevant service department, business or individual – or can be integrated into an existing service delivery tool for further analysis. The information contained in NotifyUs and the SmartNote can be used to initiate the need for a service action, which makes use of the SmartForm capability of Mobile at Work’s RoadWarrior offering. Mobile at Work also offers reports for greater insight into business processes and demands, through from NotifyUs and RoadWarrior, which can be viewed in Mobile at Work’s InfoHub portal. Mobile at Work offers a portfolio of productive mobile solutions that provide the insight and support needed to get the most out of mobile business environments. In this respect, NotifyUs is also ideal, as it provides a business-grade private communication group over which users and management teams can send intelligent notifications and receive feedback, which can optionally be forwarded to existing operational and commercial platforms. “We combine our technologies with our insight into mobile deployments and provide the support needed to get the most out of your mobile business environments,” said Mobile at Work. Sign up with NotifyUs to simplify complaint logging and get the job done in no time. This article was published in partnership with Mobile at Work.
