Microsoft is connecting blockchain technology to a number of its platforms and infrastructures, including Office 365, Azure, and SharePoint. Speaking to CoinDesk, Microsoft Azure general manager Matt Kerner said the company aims to offer users the ability to port their data from its platforms to a blockchain. Microsoft is specifically examining the ability to leverage blockchain technology for efficient data analytics, and is integrating additional blockchain tools into its Azure cloud platform. “[Blockchain] is already improving the way transactions happen,” Kerner told CoinDesk. “We believe the same will be true with data analytics.” Microsoft’s aim for its expanding blockchain infrastructure is to keep its platform open, which may enable a consortium that will not necessarily be exclusive to its Azure cloud platform. Kerner added that using blockchain technology to format and standardise data storage for significant volumes of data could have an impact on the data analytics market.
