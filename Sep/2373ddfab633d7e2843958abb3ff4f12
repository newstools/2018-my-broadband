Instagram is testing a new feature which will allow users to re-share posts from other accounts to their own feed, The Verge reports. Enabling re-sharing has been resisted by company executives, but could help to drive traffic on the platform. According to the report, this feature is known as “seamless sharing”, and will add a new “share to feed” option in the settings menu for individual posts. In the testing phase, posts can be re-shared at least twice – with re-shared posts appearing underneath the name and photo of the user who shared it. The report stated that the feature is still early in development and there is no indication on whether it will launch. Instagram did not respond to The Verge when asked for comment.
