Twitter has adapted the layout of its timeline to prioritise live broadcasts. The company said in a tweet that live streams from accounts which users follow will now appear at the top of their timeline, before other content. This new feature includes live broadcasts related to breaking news, personalities, and sports. Twitter has already rolled out the changes to its Android and iOS applications, and has added support for audio-only live broadcasts. The social media platform also recently revealed that it is testing other features aimed at making the platform more conversational. These features are still being tested internally with no confirmed release date, and include functions such as threaded conversations and status indicators. We’re making it easier to find and watch live broadcasts. Now, when accounts you follow go live, the stream will appear right at the top of your timeline. Catch breaking news, your favorite personalities, and can't-miss sports moments. Rolling out now on iOS and Android. pic.twitter.com/gka2NDHGDX — Twitter (@Twitter) September 13, 2018
