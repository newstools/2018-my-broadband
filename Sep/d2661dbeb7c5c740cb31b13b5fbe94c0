The Tor Project has released an experimental version of a Tor mobile browser on the Google Play Store. The application is still in alpha and users should expect to encounter a number of bugs when using the browser. While other Tor browsers such as Orfox exist for Android, this is the first official mobile browser released by the Tor Project. The Tor Browser for Android requires the installation of a proxy application called Orbot, which connects the browser to the Tor network. Developers aim to remove the reliance on Orbot for the upcoming stable Android release of the Tor Browser. “Tor Browser for Android is the only official mobile browser supported by the Tor Project, developers of the world’s strongest tool for privacy and freedom online,” it said.
