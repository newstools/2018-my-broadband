Apple has launched its new lineup of iPhones, which include the iPhone Xs and Xs Max, as well as the more affordable iPhone Xr. All of the devices sport the same notched display and facial recognition technology first featured on last year’s iPhone X. Apple has also added a long-awaited feature to its new iPhone line-up – dual SIM support. The manufacturer has implemented Dual-SIM Dual-Standby functionality in its new devices, which allow users to use two different phone numbers on a single smartphone. This allows the smartphone to dynamically switch the active number depending on whether it is being called or not, and users can select which number to call from. Many South Africans are used to dual-SIM smartphones having a SIM tray with two nano-SIM slots – but Apple’s new iPhones do not work this way. Instead, the company will use a single nano-SIM slot and an eSIM to provide dual-SIM functionality. An eSIM is an embedded SIM card which is built into the device and needs to be enabled by a mobile network to function as a second SIM. Once you have inserted your nano-SIM into the physical SIM slot on the device and have activated its eSIM with your chosen mobile network, you can use both numbers interchangeably. This can be great for users who travel regularly, as they can register their eSIM with their local mobile network and swap out the physical SIM for others when travelling abroad. Users can also take advantage of the best deals available on multiple networks by using the physical SIM for calling and texting, and the eSIM for mobile data usage – or vice versa. Apple stated during its launch event that because Apple eSIMs are not supported in China, it will launch a special version of its iPhone in the country. This device will feature a unique SIM tray design which can support two physical SIM cards mounted back-to-back. This special dual-SIM solution is pictured below.
