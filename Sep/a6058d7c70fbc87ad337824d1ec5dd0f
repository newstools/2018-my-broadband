President Cyril Ramaphosa has launched a new investigation into a water ministry contract with SAP, Reuters reported. This investigation will be conducted by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) and follows a statement earlier this year by the ani-graft agency that it would conduct its own probe into the contract. SAP said it is reviewing all public-sector work in South Africa dating back to 2010 in response to the investigation. “If we identify any matters of concern, we will address and manage them vigorously and comprehensively,” SAP said. “SAP continues to cooperate with US and South African authorities in their ongoing investigations.” The SIU will investigate whether government officials or SAP employees had broken any laws in the period from January 2015 to the present and report their findings directly to Ramaphosa. SAP and the Department of Water and Sanitation were previously accused of being involved in a “double billing” scandal where hundreds of millions were wasted. The department reportedly purchased R950 million in “unlimited” SAP software licences for itself, all nine water boards, and the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority (TCTA).
