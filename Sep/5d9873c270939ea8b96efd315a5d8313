Openview recently listed Kwese Free Sport, Trace Sports Stars, and BBC World News on their new channel numbers. The three channels are now on channel 115, 116, and 121 respectively. For those new to Openview, the broadcaster describes itself as South Africa’s first free HD satellite TV service which offers local and international entertainment in high definition. Traditional TV channels like SABC 1, 2, and 3 are included, along with a range of sports, movies, news, and learning programmes. The service does not charge a monthly subscription fee, and users are only required to buy a satellite dish and decoder. The table below shows the channels available on Openview.
