Microsoft announced it is removing Skype’s Highlights feature in an effort to simplify the user experience on the platform. Skype’s Highlights feature functioned similarly to Snapchat’s stories, allowing users to post photos and videos which their friends could view. Microsoft said it is trimming down features in the app to improve its accessibility, focussing on simpler navigation and a less complex user interface. The navigation experience will now be consistent across mobile and desktop versions of Skype, with the Chats, Calls, Contacts, and Notifications buttons moving to the top left of the windows on desktop. “We are listening to your feedback and are wholly committed to improving the Skype experience based on what you are telling us,” said Microsoft. “We hope this updated design makes Skype easier to use and provides a better Skype experience.”
