EVE Online developer CCP Games has been acquired by Pearl Abyss, the company announced in a blog post. Pearl Abyss is a Korean development studio which created the MMORPG Black Desert Online. The acquisition deal states that CCP Games will continue to operate independently in its studios in Reykjavik, London, and Shanghai. “We are thrilled to have CCP Games join our team as Black Desert Online continues to branch out globally,” said Pearl Abyss CEO Robin Jung. “CCP is a seasoned publisher with over 15 years of digital distribution experience and know-how.” CCP Games CEO Hilmar Veigar Pétursson said the partnership would allow both companies to learn from each other. “I have been seriously impressed with what Pearl Abyss has achieved ever since I first visited their website for Black Desert Online and subsequently became an avid player of the game,” Pétursson said. “Pearl Abyss is a fast-growing company with lots to offer in terms of technology, capability and vision.”
