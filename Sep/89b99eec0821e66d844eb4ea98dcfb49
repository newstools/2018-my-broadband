Apple recently launched its new iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max flagship devices, along with a cheaper smartphone named the iPhone Xr. With its lower-resolution LCD display and single primary camera, the iPhone Xr is Apple’s new “budget” device aimed at users who can’t fork out the cash for its new high-end iPhones. The iPhone Xr does retain some features of iPhone Xs, however, including the front camera array and A12 Bionic chipset. Apple’s iPhone Xr will be available in South Africa from 26 October 2018, and will include dual-SIM support via eSIM technology.
