FNB has stated that in the 12 months to June 2018, its eWallet passed R21 billion in value of money sent. This is a 41% growth compared to the previous year, said the bank. Transactions were conducted by 6.1 million active wallets, of which nearly 2 million are regular users, it added. “Our analysis of regular eWallet users has shown that there’s still a gap in the market when it comes to solving the banking needs of unbanked and underbanked consumers,” said Pieter Woodhatch, CEO of FNB Easy sub-segment. FNB said it also expects its mobile bank account eWallet eXtra to contribute to “narrowing the gap in financial inclusion”. “Digital is key to solving the needs of customers who may be financially excluded due to limited infrastructure, among other reasons.”
