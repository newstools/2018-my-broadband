Firefox has launched its new Monitor platform, which aims to help Internet users discover when their information has been compromised. The new tool scours data breaches to determine whether your email address, password, or other information has been leaked. Monitor is available to all users for free as a partnership between Mozilla and HaveIBeenPwned. Security researcher Troy Hunt runs HaveIBeenPwned, which functions as a searchable database of data breaches. In addition to allowing users to check if their information has been compromised, Monitorâ€™s home page also offers visitors a number of tips for securing their data. This advice includes using a password manager, using different, strong passwords for different accounts, and enabling two-factor authentication.
