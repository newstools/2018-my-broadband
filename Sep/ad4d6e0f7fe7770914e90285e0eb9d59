MyBroadband’s forum community recently rated their fibre and ADSL Internet service providers (ISPs) based on value-for-money, network quality, and general service satisfaction. MyBroadband’s forum is visited by over a million South Africans each month and recently passed 12 million posts by its members. Its strong IT community has made the forum an extremely valuable platform to find help on tech-related problems and to gain insight into the local ICT market. It is for this reason that MyBroadband decided to ask this community for their views on their ISP – to see which provider offers the best service. The ratings revealed that Cool Ideas is the top-rated ISP, followed by Vox and Axxess. The table below provides an overview of the ISP ratings from MyBroadband forum members. It should be noted that these ratings were taken at 14:00 on Wednesday 19 September, and the ratings may have changed with new votes from members.
