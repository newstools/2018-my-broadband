MWEB has launched a new website, following months of development. The site will provide a solid online shopping experience with all the functionality customers need, delivering the “most user-friendly experience possible”. The upgrade includes product cards with a range of product options, and coverage maps – which show fibre and LTE coverage. “The functionality has been designed with both new and existing customers in mind.” “Customers are now able to track their applications online and existing customers can check their usage online, as well as being informed when fibre is available at their address,” said MWEB. A screenshot of the new MWEB homepage is shown below.
