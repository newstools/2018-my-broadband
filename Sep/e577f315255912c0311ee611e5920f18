Amazon has launched a new store which allows customers to shop exclusively from small and medium-sized businesses in the United States. The new platform is called Storefronts and contains a collection of over one million products from nearly 20,000 businesses. Amazon Storefronts features a number of product categories, including Back to School, Halloween, Home, Kitchen, Pet Supplies, and Books. “Amazon first invited businesses to sell on Amazon nearly two decades ago, and today, small and medium-sized businesses are a vital part of Amazon’s large selection and commitment to customers,” said Amazon VP Nicholas Denissen. “We’re championing their success with this new store and a national advertising campaign featuring a successful Michigan business selling on Amazon to customers across the US and worldwide.” Storefronts includes curated collections from small businesses, a weekly highlight displaying the Storefront of the week, and regular features on the owners behind participating businesses.
