Buying a new smartphone can be expensive, especially if you are aiming for a high-end device like the Apple iPhone Xs Max. For this reason, many smartphone buyers opt to pay a monthly premium for insurance on their device, protecting them from suffering costly repairs and replacements. All major mobile operators in South Africa offer insurance when a customer takes out a contract or purchases a device, and the pricing of their monthly premiums depends on the value of the device. These premiums can become expensive however. MyBroadband compared the smartphone insurance pricing from South African mobile operators to determine how much it will cost you to insure a smartphone on your network. Vodacom’s smartphone insurance premiums are available from the company’s website. The operator offers comprehensive and accidental damage insurance, with the comprehensive option covering loss and theft in addition to any damage. Comprehensive insurance for the R5,000 Huawei P20 Lite will cost you around R85 per month on Vodacom, while the same cover for the R31,999 iPhone Xs Max 512GB will cost you R360 per month. Below are the monthly insurance premium prices for Vodacom customers – depending on smartphone value.  MTN provided MyBroadband with its insurance premiums per smartphone value bracket up to R6,000. Devices valued above R6,000 incur an extra amount of R1.51 per R100 over, for comprehensive cover, and R1.01 per R100 for accidental cover. This means it would cost an MTN customer R392.60 per month to insure the Apple iPhone Xs Max 512GB under all-risk cover and R87.77pm to insure the Huawei P20 Lite.  Cell C’s insurance packages are listed on its website and include options for comprehensive and accidental damage cover. Cell C customers can also opt to select seperate theft and loss cover, or SIM cover at a flat rate of R9 per month. Comprehensive cover for a Huawei P20 Lite will cost you R79 per month on Cell C, while you will pay R339 per month to cover an iPhone Xs Max 512GB.  Telkom’s device insurance page states that it only covers handsets for up to a maximum of R20,000. Insuring a Huawei P20 Lite on Telkom will cost you R83 per month, while it will cost R242 per month to an insure an iPhone Xs Max 512GB – but you will only receive two thirds of the device’s value due to the R20,000 limit.
