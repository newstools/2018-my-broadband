As part of its efforts to overhaul the Android messaging experience, Google has released new, powerful search features for its Messages application. Messages now allows users to search for content from each contact in their messaging history by tapping the search button. The menu also displays links to specific group and one-on-one conversations, and any media or links shared within past conversations. Google confirmed that these improvements to the search function would begin rolling out to Android users this week. The company has been working to overhaul its default messaging experience of late, recently rolling out a web-based version of the Messages platform. This allows users with the Messages app to send or receive texts from their PC, verifying the identity of the user via one-time passwords received in the mobile app.
