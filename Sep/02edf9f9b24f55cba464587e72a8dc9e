BitTorrent has officially released µTorrent Web, a web-based torrent client for Windows which makes it possible to download and play torrents inside the browser. µTorrent Web has been in testing since February, aiming to replicate the experience of streaming video by allowing users to start watching a video while they are still downloading it. The new web client for Windows works across Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. “As µTorrent Web now comes out of Beta and into full release, we know that millions of our users are familiar with and love the desktop version of µTorrent, also known as µTorrent Classic,” BitTorrent said. “Our long term plan is to continue development across both products and make them available on utorrent.com.” <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
