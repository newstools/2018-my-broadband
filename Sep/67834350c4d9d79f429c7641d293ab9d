Twitter has detailed an update to its platform when the “Show the best Tweets first” setting is off. With the setting disabled, you will now only see tweets from people you follow in reverse-chronological order, Twitter said. Previously when the setting was off you would see the “In case you missed it” box, and recommended tweets from people you don’t follow. “We’ve learned that when showing the best tweets first, people find Twitter more relevant and useful. However, we’ve heard feedback from people who at times prefer to see the most recent tweets,” Twitter stated. “We’re working on new ways to give you more control over your timeline.” Twitter said its goal with the timeline is to balance showing you the most recent tweets with the best tweets you’re likely to care about. Twitter said its plan is to eventually replace this feature.
