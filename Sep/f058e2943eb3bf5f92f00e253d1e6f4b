Spree will fold into Superbalist in October 2018, according to a post on its website. “We are coming together as one and joining our fashion forces to bring you South Africa’s biggest ever online fashion destination,” said Spree. “When Spree becomes Superbalist, we will be able to offer you an even better overall experience: a wider selection of fashion, brands, categories, sizes, delivery options, and payment methods – all while maintaining the customer service we both pride ourselves on.” The announcement follows a statement in June from Media24 and Takealot, informing stakeholders that Spree and Superbalist will merge. The merger will create an “exciting online fashion platform for South African consumers”. “Merging the two businesses into a single entity will create a larger, more focused platform on which to build a substantial online retail, footwear, and apparel business,” said the companies. Takealot Group CEO Kim Reid told MyBroadband at the time that the two businesses will fall under a new entity, FashionCo. “This is not a consumer-facing brand, but rather a new entity. Takealot will have management responsibility for FashionCo,” said Reid.
