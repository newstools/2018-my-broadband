Former president Jacob Zuma and several top ANC figures are plotting to remove President Cyril Ramaphosa, according to a report in the Sunday Times. The Sunday Times stated that Zuma held a meeting with ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule, former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo, ANC Women’s League secretary-general Meokgo Matuba, and ANC Youth League KwaZulu-Natal secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo at the Maharani hotel in Durban on Thursday. “So secret was the Maharani meeting that those who were present denied having met Zuma, even though the Sunday Times is in possession of pictures of them together inside the hotel, and outside when they left,” stated the report. The meeting was said to be about a strategy to “challenge the outcome of last year’s ANC national conference”. This conference is where Ramaphosa was elected ANC leader. The move comes at a time when Ramaphosa is attempting to crack down on corruption and state capture – and the officials involved – in South Africa. The Sunday Times stated that Magashule’s attendance is a reason for concern, as he is in charge of the day-to-day running of the ANC. Following Zuma’s time as president, the politician has faced multiple battles – of which legal ones are at the fore. According to a report from April, Zuma may have his Nkandla home taken away as part of the corruption case he faces. Zuma’s spending on upgrades to Nkandla and his relationship with the Gupta family – accused of plundering the state’s wallet – are two of the many controversies he faced during his time as president, and which still affect him today.
