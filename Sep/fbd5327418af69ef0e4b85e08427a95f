WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has stepped down as editor-in-chief of the organisation. Assange appointed former WikiLeaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson as his replacement after being cut off from communication for six months during his stay at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. Assange first sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012, but six months ago it cut off his Internet access and prevented him from seeing any visitors – except his lawyers. The organisation stated that Assange will continue to be the publisher of WikiLeaks following the appointment of Hrafnsson as editor. Hrafnsson is an award-winning Icelandic investigative journalist who served as WikiLeaks spokesperson from 2010. “I condemn the treatment of Julian Assange that leads to my new role, but I welcome the responsibility to secure the continuation of the important work based on WikiLeaks ideals,” Hrafnsson said.
