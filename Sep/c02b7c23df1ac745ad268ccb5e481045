The South Atlantic Cable System (SACS), which is 100% owned by Angola Cables, is now live and open for commercial traffic. The SACS is the first transatlantic link between Africa and the Americas, and provides more direct routing for Internet traffic. The company said the cable offers five times the speed of existing cable routings, reducing latency from Fortaleza (Brazil) to Luanda (Angola) from 350ms to 63ms. Luanda will also connect to London and Miami with approximately 128 milliseconds latency. These two content hubs will position Angola as a strategic point to serve the transatlantic region with low latency and resilient connections. Given the onward connections to the Monet Cable and the West Africa Cable System (WACS), SACS also offers reduced latency between Miami and Cape Town from 338ms to 163ms. “The cable will also contribute to reductions in data traffic costs between South America and Africa, offering savings to operators that in turn could be passed onto end-users and customers,” Angola Cables said. SACS has been designed with 100Gbps coherent WDM technology on an end-to-end solution. With four fibre pairs, it offers a total design capacity of 40Tbps between Fortaleza and Luanda.
