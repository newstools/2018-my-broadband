4,860 SIM cards were activated on Rain’s mobile network in June 2018 after the company launched its first mobile data products on 6 June. This was revealed in African Rainbow Capital’s (ARC) maiden full-year financial results, which said “by 30 June, some 4,860 SIM cards were activated without any marketing”. “Media coverage and social media posts are the major drivers in expanding the mobile customer base,” ARC said. To date, Rain’s subscriber numbers have been a closely-guarded secret – but as a 20% shareholder in Rain, ARC disclosed the company’s growth in the mobile market. Rain CEO Willem Roos confirmed that this number is accurate, but he would not comment on the sales after June. “We are still in the process of building the foundations of the business and hope to significantly increase sales once these foundations are in place,” Roos told MyBroadband. While the growth in mobile subscribers is good news for Rain, it put so much pressure on its network that the company is suspending fixed-LTE sales from November. “Due to the strong sales of our fixed-wireless offering through ISPs, and the successful launch of our mobile product, we are rapidly utilising the currently-available capacity on our network,” Roos said in July. “To ensure a continued great experience for all our customers, we have decided to suspend new sales of the fixed-wireless offering for the present time.” Existing customers with Rain fixed-LTE connections will not be affected by this change, but new customers will not be able to order the product through ISPs. Roos noted that sales of Rain’s mobile product remain unaffected by the network constraints and that robust demand continues for the company’s R50-per-gig data plan.
