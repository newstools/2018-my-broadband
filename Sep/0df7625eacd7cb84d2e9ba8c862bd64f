MultiChoice SA CEO Calvo Mawela recently said Netflix has an unfair advantage over DStv in South Africa, arguing that a regulatory change is needed to create a level playing field. Mawela said the current regulatory regime is focused on traditional pay-TV services and does not look at streaming players like Netflix. He said there is an urgent need for a regulatory change to catch up with technological advances. These comments followed a significant decline in DStv Premium subscriptions, with users dumping the service for Netflix. MultiChoice’s reaction to losing money to a disruptive competitor – and asking for this competitor to be regulated – is expected, and is also nothing new. When WhatsApp started to gain traction in South Africa and decimated SMS revenue, Vodacom and MTN called for change to the regulatory framework in 2016. Vodacom and MTN called for over-the-top (OTT) services, like WhatsApp and Skype, to be regulated in South Africa to ensure a “level playing field”. Vodacom and MTN complained that they are subject to regulations as communications service providers in South Africa, while OTT operators like WhatsApp get a free ride. MTN also took issue with the fact that services like WhatsApp do not pay taxes in South Africa. The table below provides an overview of the similarities between MultiChoice’s call to regulate Netflix, and Vodacom and MTN’s calls to regulate WhatsApp. As the car replaced horse-drawn carriages, digital music replaced CDs, and smartphones replaced printed maps, so advancement in technology continues. Fighting against technological advances is a war which cannot be won, as Vodacom and MTN found out. WhatsApp is now used by most smartphone owners in South Africa and has replaced SMS as the preferred messaging option. The mobile operators are now adapting to this changing landscape by offering data-centric packages and WhatsApp data bundles to serve the needs of their subscribers. If they did not, consumers would migrate to Cell C which embraced WhatsApp and even offered its subscribers free WhatsApp data a few years ago. MultiChoice is facing a similar dilemma to Vodacom and MTN – a new disruptive technology is costing it money, and it must fight back. Just like SMS and mobile calls, which are very expensive when compared to WhatsApp, DStv Premium is far more expensive than Netflix. As faster and cheaper broadband becomes available in South Africa, Netflix becomes more attractive to locals. What makes it more difficult for MultiChoice is that it is not clear how it can fight back without cutting its DStv prices and offering an online experience in line with Netflix. Some good news is that MultiChoice has started to adapt by creating a “leaner and more agile organisation to remain globally competitive”. The company added that it is transforming its business to be “fit for the future”, with a strong focus on online products. How effective MultiChoice’s strategy has been will be revealed in its next set of results.
