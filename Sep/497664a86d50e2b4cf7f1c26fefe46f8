Microsoft has advised Skype users to update their applications to the latest version – Skype 8 – before 1 November 2018. The company announced earlier this year that it planned to stop supporting older versions of Skype towards the end of 2018. In an update posted on the Skype blog, Microsoft confirmed that support for Skype versions 7 and below will end on 1 November 2018 for desktop devices and 15 November 2018 for mobile and tablet devices. “Although you may be able to use older versions for a little while, we encourage you to update today to avoid any interruption,” Microsoft said. The company has been working on implementing a number of features requested by users, including call recording and the ability to search in conversations. “You’ll soon be able to add phone numbers to existing contacts, have more control over your availability status, and more,” Microsoft added.
