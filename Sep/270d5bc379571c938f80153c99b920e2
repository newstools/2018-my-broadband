Former president Jacob Zuma reportedly put pressure on Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson to pay Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s legal fees, according to the Sunday Times. The report stated that over R1 million was paid towards Motsoeneng’s case, following his dismissal as SABC COO. The news follows a report in March 2018, where it was stated the SABC had to pay R22 million in legal fees to defend Motsoeneng during his time at the broadcaster. The Johannesburg Labour Court also ruled in September 2017 that Motsoeneng and the SABC must pay a portion of the legal costs for the wrongful dismissal of the SABC8. The latest report states that Zuma allegedly sent former SAA board chair Dudu Myeni to plead with Watson to contribute to Motsoeneng’s legal fees. Motsoeneng’s legal bill stems from him approaching the CCMA and the High Court in Johannesburg in a bid to fight his dismissal from the SABC – with the battle ongoing. The SABC dismissed Motsoeneng in June 2017, following charging him with bringing the broadcaster into disrepute. Bosasa declined to comment on the payments in the report, and said it was investigating the allegations. The report further stated that Bosasa has been used “as an ATM for politicians and those who are politically connected”.
