Apple launched three new iPhones on Wednesday – the iPhone Xs, Xs Max, and Xr. The Xs and Xs Max are very similar, with the Xs Max sporting a bigger screen – 5.8-inch vs 6.5-inch. The iPhone Xr, however, is substantially different to the iPhone Xs and is marketed as the more affordable smartphone in the latest line-up. First off, there’s the price. The Xr starts at $749 for a 64GB model, and goes up to $899 for a 256GB model. The iPhone Xs starts at $999 for a 64GB model, and goes up to $1,349 for a 512GB model. The displays on the devices are another differentiating factor, with the Xs sporting an OLED screen with a 2,436 x 1,125 resolution. The Xr packs an LCD display with a resolution of 1,792 x 828. The Xr’s screen is also slightly bigger – 6.1-inch vs 5.8-inch on the Xs. Apple’s 12MP dual-camera system on the Xs did not make it to the Xr, either, and the cheaper iPhone features a single 12MP sensor on the back. The Xs further features a higher IP rating than the Xr – IP68 vs IP67. Both devices run iOS 12, however, and are powered by the A12 Bionic chip. Apple said the new devices also feature superior battery life to their predecessors – the iPhone X and iPhone 8. 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, NFC, and LTE connectivity are packed into both models, too, along with Apple’s Lightning port. Face ID security and dual-SIM support – enabled by eSIM technology – are also included in both models. Where the Xr does have an advantage, though, is in the colour department. While the iPhone Xs is available in silver, space grey, and gold, the iPhone Xr can be purchased in white, black, blue, yellow, coral, and Product Red finishes.
