A teenager from Melbourne, Australia has been sentenced to eight months probation for hacking Apple and downloading sensitive files, AppleInsider reported. Reports state that the hacker downloaded close to 1,000GB of data from Apple. The hacker was 16 when the crimes were committed, and he therefore stood trial in the Children’s Court. The defendant pleaded guilty last month and was waiting to be sentenced this month. His lawyer stated that the teen hacked Apple several times over the course of a year because he was a big fan of the company, and that he dreamed of working there. Australian Federal Police obtained and executed a search warrant for the teen’s home last year, where they seized two Apple laptops, a mobile phone, and a hard drive. Hacking files and instructions were discovered in a directory on a computer titled “hacky hack hack.” Apple has assured clients that none of their data was compromised when the Australian teenager hacked its systems.
