Nintendo has revealed new wireless NES controllers for its Switch console. The controllers are $60 and are available exclusively for Nintendo Switch Online members. “With a Nintendo Switch Online membership, you can play enhanced NES games the way they’re meant to be played – using Nintendo Entertainment System-style controllers,” the store page reads. Users can charge the wireless NES controllers by slotting them into the sides of the console, and the devices feature the same layout as the original NES controllers. Two controllers are included in the package offered on Nintendo’s online store, although it is important to note that these devices do not function as Joy-Cons. Nintendo’s Switch NES controllers will be available for pre-order on 18 September and will begin shipping in December 2018.
