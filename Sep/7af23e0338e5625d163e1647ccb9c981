iStore has released its pricing for the new iPhone Xs and Xs Max in South Africa. Customers will be able to pre-order the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max from 21 September. They will be available in stores starting 28 September 2018. The prices start at R21,999 for a 64GB iPhone Xs, and go up to R31,999 for a 512GB iPhone Xs Max. Apple’s new devices sport powerful A12 Bionic processors and high-resolution OLED displays, and the price range is not a surprise – as the iPhones are aimed at the top-end of the market. One of the topics which comes up each year when Apple releases its new iPhones is the South African rand prices versus the US dollar prices. The dollar prices for the iPhones start at $999 for the 64GB iPhone Xs, and go up to $1,449 for the 512GB iPhone Xs Max. A straight conversion to rand is not an accurate indication of what the local price should be, however, as elements like VAT, import tariffs and duties, and shipping and business costs must be taken into account – as the iPhones are imported into South Africa. The comparison does provide a benchmark for the markup which takes place in the process, however, and provides a measure for users who may look to import the device themselves from the US. The table below compares the US dollar price, the local rand price, and a straight dollar-to-rand conversion price of the iPhone Xs and Xs Max phones.
