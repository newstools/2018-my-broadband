Apple’s iPhone Xs and Xs Max have been listed online for pre-order at local retailer Technomobi. The iPhone Xs – pronounced “10-ess” – is made of surgical-grade steel and the most durable glass ever used in a smartphone – and was launched in the US on 12 September. Apple said the new phone will be available in gold, silver, and space grey colours. New additions to the iPhone Xs include an upgraded IP68 resistance rating and a 5.8-inch OLED Super Retina display – the highest quality screen ever on an iOS device. Apple also unveiled the iPhone Xs Max, a new smartphone with similar features to the device it was launched alongside – but with a 6.5-inch OLED Super Retina display. The devices are set to start shipping in South Africa from 28 September 2018. According to the listings on Technomobi’s page, the iPhone XS and Xs Max will sell for the following prices locally. Update – Technomobi has removed the pricing from its page.
