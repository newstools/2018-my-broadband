MyBroadbandâ€™s 2018 Salary Survey results revealed that C-level executives are the happiest IT professionals in South Africa. The salary survey was conducted in September and was completed by 2,695 IT professionals in South Africa. To ensure accurate results, various filters were applied to eliminate entries which were unlikely to be a true reflection of local salaries and perceptions of the industry. The survey results showed that IT professionals are generally happy in their jobs, with an average happiness score of 6.69 (out of 10). This, however, does not mean that a large percentage of IT professionals are not looking for new opportunities. According to the survey results, 44% of IT professionals are currently looking for a new job. This high percentage may be linked to the instability in South Africa, with many qualified IT professionals looking for opportunities overseas. The survey results show that 42% of IT professionals are planning to leave South Africa permanently or work abroad. The table below shows the average happiness of different groups of IT professionals in South Africa.
