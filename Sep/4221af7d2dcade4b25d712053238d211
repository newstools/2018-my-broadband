SAFibre is in advanced negotiations with Ulwembu Business Services for the acquisition of a majority shareholding in the ISP. The company said that following the acquisition, Ulwembu will be well positioned to roll out fibre infrastructure on a large scale in South Africa. “With the partnership, Ulwembu will bring their considerable business acumen and resources to assist SAFibre, allowing for strategic growth in the ISP world,” said SAFibre MD Kevin Koekemoer. “We are excited about this partnership as within Ulwembu Business Services corporate group we will be a part of a fully inclusive telecommunication ecosystem.” Koekemoer told MyBroadband that SAFibre customers will not be affected by the transaction. The name of the company will also remain SAFibre and they hope for the acquisition to be complete in the coming month.
