NASA has reported that its Curiosity rover on Mars has been experiencing problems with sending data it has collected back to Earth. “Over the past few days, engineers here have been working to address an issue on Curiosity that is preventing it from sending much of the science and engineering data stored in its memory,” NASA said on its blog. Curiosity first started experiencing the issue on Saturday, the report stated. The rover can transmit data stored in its memory, as well as “real-time” data about Curiosity’s status when it links to a relay orbiter or Deep Space Network antenna. It is transmitting real-time data normally, but the scientific data recorded in memory is not sending. “Engineers are expanding the details the rover transmits in these real-time data to better diagnose the issue. Because the amount of data coming down is limited, it might take some time for the engineering team to diagnose the problem,” NASA said. In addition to gathering more diagnostic data from the rover, engineers are also preparing to use the rover’s backup computer in case they need to use it to troubleshoot the primary computer.
