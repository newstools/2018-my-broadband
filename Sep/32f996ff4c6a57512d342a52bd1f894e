ICASA announced it is conducting a regulatory impact assessment on Must-Carry Regulations. The regulations were implemented in 2008 and aimed to make public broadcast service television available to all South Africans. Must-carry regulations control the extent to which the subscription broadcasting services must carry the television programmes provided by the Public Broadcast Service Licensee. ICASA said the regulations form part of the universal service and access obligation imposed on subscription television services. The authority has issued a questionnaire requesting data to assist it in making an informed decision on whether to review the must-carry regulations. Interested stakeholders have until 26 October 2018 to send back the questionnaire to ICASA for consideration.
