Luno has launched its new African regional headquarters in Johannesburg. The company facilitates the exchange of Bitcoin and Ethereum for fiat currency such as South African rand. Luno operates in over 40 markets across Europe and Africa, and plans to expand across additional African markets following the launch of its new headquarters. “The new team in Johannesburg will be working closely with our team in Lagos, Nigeria, to launch across a number of African markets over the coming months,” said Luno CEO Marcus Swanepoel. Luno is recruiting for over 30 roles in Johannesburg to expand its Africa coverage teams and create a new engineering team based in the city. “We will be investing a significant amount of capital and resources into our African expansion over the coming months and years,” Swanepoel said.
