Rain launched its mobile services in South Africa in 2018, following the launch of its fixed-LTE packages through local ISPs. The new entrant recently announced that due to the increasing number of users joining the network, however, it will temporarily stop the sale of its fixed-LTE packages from 1 November 2018. This is to combat capacity constraints on its network. Despite the impending constraints, Rain has performed well in MyBroadband network tests – beating Telkom and Cell C when it comes to data services. Rain has now announced that it aims to grow its team and is looking for “one-in-a-million” candidates who can “get stuff done”. The positions on offer at Rain are listed below.
