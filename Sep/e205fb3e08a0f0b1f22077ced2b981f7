GoPro has launched three new cameras – the HERO7 Black, HERO7 Silver, and HERO7 White – which are available from Outdoorphoto on pre-order. According to GoPro these are the simplest cameras it has ever built and offer better value-for-money than any of its previous devices. These rugged, pocket-sized cameras capture high-quality photo and video, are waterproof without a housing, voice command-enabled, and have WiFi connectivity. They also have built-in electronic image stabilization to smooth out playback of experiences that are inherently bumpy. GoPro has also redesigned the user interface, which now resembles the feel of a smartphone and delivers content with a few taps of your finger. The images below provide a comparison of the HERO7 Black, HERO7 Silver and HERO7 White.  This article was published in partnership with Outdoorphoto.
