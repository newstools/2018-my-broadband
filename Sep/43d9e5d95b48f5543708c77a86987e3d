BMW Motorrad has showcased a new self-driving version of its R1200GS motorcycle. The self-driving motorcycle can start its engine, accelerate, and stop autonomously – and can also lean into turns to maintain stability while driving. BMW Motorrad stated that this self-driving vehicle is not being developed for consumers, but will instead be used to develop new safety features for conventional vehicles. Specifically, the data collected from this prototype’s driving patterns will be used to alert inattentive drivers to dangerous behaviour. “The prototype helps us to expand our knowledge about the vehicle’s dynamics so that we can classify the rider’s behavior and determine if a future situation will become dangerous or not,” the company said. “If so, we can inform, warn, or intervene directly.” Below is a video of the self-driving motorcycle in action.
