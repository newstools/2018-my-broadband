AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon have launched Project Verify, which is aimed at authenticating user logins on their smartphones. Engadget reported that the single sign-on service will replace the need for a password manager, and works by confirming a user’s identity using certain elements. These include their phone number, SIM card information, type of phone account, and IP address. The Project Verify app will then let users log in to services that have enabled the feature, and can also be used for two-factor authentication purposes. The video below provides an overview of Project Verify – and how it uses a user’s “online identity” to replace the need to submit passwords to sites.
