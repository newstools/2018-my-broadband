MultiChoice has told MyBroadband that the free Showmax offer with DStv Premium is set to continue after 31 March 2019. MyBroadband published an article earlier today which stated the company had no intention to change the expiration date of the offer, which was set in its terms and conditions as March 2019. MultiChoice told MyBroadband that it has no intention to stop the free Showmax offer, and as things stand at the moment, they have not made a decision to end the free Showmax offer with DStv Premium. There was a miscommunication between MyBroadband and MultiChoice regarding the intention to stop or continue with the offer. “Closer to the time – March 2019 – depending how our OTT products evolve, we could look at a different approach, but the default position is that it will continue,” said the company. Showmax, which is normally R99 per month, offers an online streaming service that competes against the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime. DStv and Showmax announced in September 2017 that DStv Premium subscribers would get Showmax bundled with their DStv account for free.
