BitCo announced today that it will launch fibre-to-the-home products on 1 October 2018. The company said its FTTH packages would be uncapped and available in speeds of 20Mbps, 50Mbps, 100Mbps, and 200Mbps. The new fibre products will feature month-to-month package options, a free-to-use router, and no data limits. “With competitive pricing, 24-hour support, no contracts, and a free-to-use router, we’re certain avid Internet users will welcome us home,” said BitCo. Customers can sign up for BitCo’s FTTH packages on the company’s website from 1 October 2018. Speaking to MyBroadband, BitCo stated that the fibre packages will initially be offered on Vumatel, with other network providers being considered for the future. A once-off installation fee of R1,725 is charged if the client does not have a Vumatel CPE/ONT running in their home, along with a R499 activation fee. The fibre packages then start at R759 per month for a 20Mbps service, and go up to R1,399 for a 200Mbps symmetrical line.
