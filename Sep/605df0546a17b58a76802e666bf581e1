The Constitutional Court has handed down its judgement on the private use of marijuana, as reported by eNCA. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has upheld an earlier high court judgment. The judgment decriminalises the use of dagga at home, stated the report. The Western Cape High Court ruled in March 2017 that it is an infringement to ban the use of dagga by adults in private homes. According to a report by News24, the 2017 ruling allows for the possession, cultivation, and use of dagga at home for private use. “It has also ruled that Parliament must change sections of the Drug Trafficking Act, as well as the Medicines Control Act,” stated at the report. The ruling comes after Dagga Party leader Jeremy Acton and Rastafarian Garreth Prince applied to the court to decriminalise marijuana.
