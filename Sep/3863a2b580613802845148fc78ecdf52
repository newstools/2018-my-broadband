Huawei launched its new Mate 20 Lite smartphone at an event in Randburg, Johannesburg today, revealing the official South African pricing for the device. The Mate 20 Lite sports a modern chassis with a FullView display and rear-mounted fingerprint sensor – and runs Android 8.1. Dual-camera systems are located on both the front and back of the smartphone, and the device leverages artificial intelligence features to power a number of unique functions, including the ability to improve images taken with these camera systems. Camera features include AI-assisted bokeh effects, composition, and slow-motion video at 480fps. Huawei’s Mate 20 Lite is powered by the Kirin 710 chipset and its GPU is supercharged with the company’s GPU Turbo technology. The Huawei Mate 20 Lite will be available for R8,999 on 5 October 2018 and is currently available for pre-order from the company’s website. Customers who pre-order the device before 5 October will also receive a free Huawei SoundStone portable Bluetooth speaker.
