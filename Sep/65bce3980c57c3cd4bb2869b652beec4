A patent application filed by Walmart indicates that the retailer is investigating the implications of blockchain technology. The information in the application describes a blockchain-based system for the authentication and coordination of delivery drones which function autonomously. Allowing the drones to authenticate the identity of other drones will allow them to pass packages between each other without manual interference. These autonomous drones could use a variety of technologies to communicate and identify each other, including QR codes, RFID, or Wi-Fi. The application describes the authentication system as being based on the communication of blockchain keys between drones and a distributed database. This system would allow autonomous drones or robots to authenticate the identity of other devices, provided they could identify them by their appearance or signals sent.
