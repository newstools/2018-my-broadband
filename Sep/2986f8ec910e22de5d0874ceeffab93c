Instagram is developing a standalone mobile application for online shopping, The Verge reported. The report stated that the app could be named IG Shopping and would allow users to browse products from merchants they follow in the Instagram app. Instagram reportedly believes that it is well-positioned to expand into the online shopping market, and has previously tested shopping features in its mobile app which allow users to purchase items directly from posts. The company is also currently testing integrating ecommerce with Instagram stories posted by participating businesses. There is currently no information regarding the potential launch date for the IG Shopping application. Instagram continues to add new features to its mobile application, including contact synchronisation with Facebook Messenger and its new status indicators, which allow users to see when their friends are online.
