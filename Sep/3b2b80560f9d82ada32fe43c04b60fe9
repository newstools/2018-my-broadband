Huawei has stated it will reveal its next flagship smartphone, the Mate 20, on 16 October 2018. A report by The Next Web stated the device will be powered by the Kirin 980 chip – which Huawei unveiled last week. The chipset is the world’s first commercial SoC manufactured with TSMC’s 7nm process. The report further stated that the Mate 20 may feature a 4,200mAh battery and a 6.3-inch display. Huawei’s triple-lens camera system may also make its way into the Mate 20, which – on the P20 Pro – has been called the best smartphone camera in the world.
