AAD 2018 is taking place at Waterkloof Airforce Base from 19-23 September, showcasing what the biggest military players have to offer. The Africa Aerospace and Defence (AAD) is Africa’s only aerospace and defence expo that combines both a trade exhibition and an air show. It is also the only international defence exhibition and conference in the African region demonstrating the latest technology across land, sea, and air, added the organisers. “Held biennially in the City of Tshwane, the AAD Expo is one of South Africa’s largest contributors to the country’s GDP and is regarded as a national asset,” states its website. Images of the event from Friday’s show day are posted below.
