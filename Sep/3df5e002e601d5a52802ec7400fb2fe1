OpenSignal has released its latest State of Mobile Networks report for South Africa. The September 2018 report tracks data from May to July 2018, and shows that Vodacom is at the front of the pack. “Vodacom won six out of seven of our national awards, and it scored highly in all of our regional speed and latency categories. However, MTN topped our coveted national 4G availability metric, and dominated LTE reach in the regions,” said OpenSignal. “Vodacom has now firmly established itself as the dominant South African mobile operator in our metrics, showing its rivals a clean pair of heels in all of our national speed and latency categories.” The report is based on 433 million data samples collected from nearly 40,000 devices, added the company. The tables below show the results of the report. Vodacom won six of the seven awards on offer, including best download speeds, best upload speeds, and best latency. MTN won the 4G availability award.  Vodacom dominated the download speed categories across all the measured sectors. MTN was second, with Cell C and Telkom fighting for third.    Vodacom took top spot in the upload speed category, with MTN second.  Vodacom won the latency tests, too, as shown below (the lower the latency, the better). MTN came in second, with Telkom and Cell C taking the bottom two places.   MTN took first place in the 4G availability category, however, beating Vodacom, Telkom, and Cell C.  Looking at the major metros in South Africa, Vodacom and MTN continued to dominate – claiming the best download speeds and latencies among the major operators. Cell C, however, managed to pick up a win in Cape Town when it came to 4G availability in the city, tying with MTN. Click the table below to enlarge it.
