LG South Africa has launched a new WhatsApp support service for customers. The platform will allow customers to chat with customer service agents when issues are reported. LG’s WhatsApp service will support all forms of messaging, except for voice calling, including: A customer service expert will contact the customer the next working day and a service expert will fix the appliance at the residence. “One of our main objectives at LG is to make life easier for our customers. Instead of them phoning a call centre, we thought we’d take the frustration out of this process,” said LG South Africa. Customers can add +27 84 334 4555 to their WhatsApp contact list to use LG’s WhatsApp support service.
