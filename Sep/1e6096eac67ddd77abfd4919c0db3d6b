If you share a message from a WhatsApp group with ill intentions, you can face criminal and civil cases. This is the view of legal expert Verlie Oosthuizen, partner and head of social media law at the law firm Shepstone & Wylie. Some of the highest-profile social media scandals in South Africa were the result of posts in closed WhatsApp groups which were later shared publicly. These cases include Margaret van Wyk’s nude selfie which was posted by accident in a school hockey group, and Adam Catzavelos’ racist rant which was sent to a WhatsApp group. This raises the question as to whether it is legal for a member of a WhatsApp group to share messages from a closed WhatsApp group with the outside world. Oosthuizen told MyBroadband that the legal implications are complicated and may depend on the intention of the person who has shared the content from the group. “If the intention is to expose the person and they knew that it could damage the reputation of that person, then it could be crimen injuria,” she said. Crimen injuria consist of unlawfully and intentionally impairing the dignity or privacy of another person and can result in a fine or even a jail sentence. Sharing a WhatsApp post which defames a person can also be a civil infringement of the person’s privacy or dignity, Oosthuizen said. “In the event that the person could prove a case in terms of any of the causes of action above then they would be able to pursue legal action [against the person who shared the WhatsApp post],” she said. “When the Protection of Personal Information Act comes into full force, it could be a contravention of that Act,” she added.
