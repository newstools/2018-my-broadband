The Department of Labour has issued a statement confirming there was a recent attempted cyberattack on its website. The attack took place over the weekend, and the department’s IT unit confirmed it was a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack – aimed at one of the department’s public-facing servers. “The attempt was through the external Domain Name Server (DNS) server which is sitting at the State Information Technology Agency,” said Department of Labour acting chief information officer Xola Monakali. “No internal servers, systems, or client information were compromised, as they are separated with the relevant protection in place.” The department said it has partnered with SITA and other security experts to investigate the matter, and assured clients and the public that their information remains secure.
