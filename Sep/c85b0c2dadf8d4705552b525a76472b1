Samsung has unveiled a new Galaxy A7 smartphone. The device features triple-lens rear camera, a 6-inch display, and up to 6GB of RAM, said Samsung. “We’re excited to introduce innovative new features to the A series with the Galaxy A7, a practical but powerful device that is built to help make your everyday both convenient and extraordinary,” said Samsung. The triple-lens camera consists of 24MP (F1.7), ultra-wide 8MP (F2.4), and 120-degree “depth” 5MP (F2.2) sensors. The front camera on the device is a 24MP (F2.0) unit. “The Galaxy A7 brings out the best in what it sees. Featuring Samsung’s intelligent Scene Optimizer, the Galaxy A7’s camera categorises your subject and adjusts the colour, contrast, and brightness to instantly optimise image quality.” Samsung’s Galaxy A7 will be available in Europe and Asia later this year.
