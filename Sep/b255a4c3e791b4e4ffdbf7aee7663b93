The registrar of Zoho.com, TierraNet, removed the domain from the Internet last night without any notice, said Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu. Zoho is a cloud productivity suite which administrators may host on their domains. Vembu appealed to Zoho’s followers to put him in contact with TierraNet, as requests for technical support redirected them to TierraNet’s legal department. TierraNet reportedly stated that Zoho’s domain was suspended after repeated requests to take action against users who were using the service to send phishing emails. “They didn’t, so we had to suspend them. We have been in contact with them and their services should be up in 24-48 hours,” said TierraNet. Vembu said that TierraNet’s actions were excessive. “There were a total of three complaints in two months. We took action on two of them immediately and one is pending investigation,” said Vembu. Zoho did not appear to have Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) configured for its domain. Zoho.com was restored during the night, and users were advised to use Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) DNS to access their services. Vembu said they will also move their domain registration. pic.twitter.com/bXPF7P56vW — Heather Jones (@HeatherJonesRS) September 24, 2018
