New and existing Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles will soon receive support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in the United States, MacRumours reports. A spokesperson confirmed that all vehicles from the 2019 model year going forward which have InControl Touch Pro or Touch Pro Duo infotainment systems will feature optional support for Android Auto and CarPlay. This optional smartphone connectivity package will be priced from $280 upwards, depending on the vehicle model and trim level. Existing Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles with the same infotainment systems will receive a retroactive update enabling CarPlay and Android Auto functionality, the spokesperson confirmed.
