Google recently launched a new version of Chrome, which brought a new design and features to the browser. Rounded tabs, with a cleaner and more modern look, and a new UI were implemented, promising to provide users with an improved experience over previous versions of Chrome. Google also punted strengthened security in its browser, which includes the way Chrome handles passwords. “Staying secure on the web means using strong and unique passwords for every different site,” said Google. “When it’s time to create a new password, Chrome will now generate one for you. Chrome will save it, and next time you sign in, it’ll be there, on both your laptop and phone.” Chrome is not the only browser which generates passwords for users, however. For macOS users running Safari, this feature is already available – with Apple’s web browser offering generated passwords to users when they create a new account on a website. To see how Chrome’s password generator feature stacks up against that of Safari’s, we put the two to the test. We opened Chrome and Safari on a MacBook Pro and created new user profiles on several websites – letting the browsers generate passwords for us. These passwords were then documented, and put into the Kaspersky Secure Password Check site to check how strong they were. The results of the test are detailed in the tale below, with the Kaspersky site rating password strength by how long it would take an average home computer to brute-force the key.
