TorrentFreak has released its list of the most downloaded movies through BitTorrent over the past week. TorrentFreak uses its estimates of the number of times a movie was downloaded for its weekly chart. The First Purge entered the chart in the top spot, while Solo: A Star Wars Story and Sicario: Day of the Soldado held onto second and third respectively. “The data for our weekly download chart is for informational and educational reference only,” said TorrentFreak. New movies shared via torrent sites, and included in the list below, are typically “illegal” copies, as they infringe on the copyright of their respective content owners.
