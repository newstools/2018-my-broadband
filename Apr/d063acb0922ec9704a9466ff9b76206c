Afrihost has launched 200Mbps fibre-to-the-home packages on Openserve. Openserve recently announced it would make 200Mbps fibre infrastructure available to ISPs, and local providers have started listing their products. Previously, the maximum speed on Openserve fibre was limited to 100Mbps down and 50Mbps up. Maximum speeds on Openserve fibre can now reach up to 200Mbps down and 100Mbps up. Afrihost offers capped and uncapped fibre packages to customers covered by Openserve’s infrastructure. Its Home, Premium, and Priority Uncapped packages offer different levels of throttling and shaping. While a Home Uncapped connection can be subjected to throttling at usage thresholds, Premium connections are never throttled. Priority connections are not throttled, and their connection is never shaped – unlike the other two packages, which can be shaped during peak hours. The Openserve 200Mbps fibre packages available from Afrihost, along with their prices, are below.
