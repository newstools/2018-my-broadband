SqwidNet has launched a new technology competition for university students across South Africa. SqwidNet is a licensed Sigfox IoT network operator in South Africa, and the competition will challenge students to build IoT solutions on the Sigfox network. The challenge will begin on 25 April 2018, and entries will be accepted until 25 July 2018. “The market is ripe with opportunities and these young students and graduates are welcome to submit the ideas for their projects,” said SqwidNet. Qualifying entries will be inspected by SqwidNet partners, who will evaluate their potential for commercial implementation. SqwidNet will also offer participants access to its entrepreneurship programme and give them the opportunity to register as a Sigfox partner. Competition winners will be announced on 1 August, with cash prizes for the winning teams and their faculties. Winners will also get the chance to present their designs in “IoT Valley” in Toulouse, France. Participants will be provided with free development kits and access to SqwidNet’s IoT network, in addition to support from the company’s local team.
