Google unveiled its new design for Gmail yesterday, which features a modern and clean look. The new look was said to be available to all Gmail users, but several South African users reported not being able to access the upgrade. This has passed, however, and the “New Gmail” is now available to local users. Users can upgrade to the new Gmail by clicking the Settings cog icon on the top-right of their Gmail page, and selecting “Try the new Gmail”.  Google said the new Gmail not only features a new look, but multiple upgrades. This includes advanced security features, new applications of Google’s artificial intelligence, and more integrations with other G Suite apps. The company said its recently-introduced protections in Gmail have helped block 99.9% of business email compromise threats, and the new Gmail has added to this with a “confidential mode”. This lets users protect sensitive content in emails by creating expiration dates, revoking sent messages, and adding additional authentication via text message to view an email. Google said it has also redesigned its security warnings in Gmail, so information is easier to see and understand. “These bigger, bolder warnings will help you be even more informed when it comes to potentially risky email,” it said.  Google has also promised performance improvements for regular Gmail users. The redesigned Gmail application helps users take action quicker, it said. “Now you can see and click attachments in your inbox before ever opening a thread. You can also hover over messages to do things like RSVP to a meeting invite, archive an email thread, or snooze an email until the time is right,” said Google. Too see how the old Gmail compares to the new version, we have posted screenshots of both below. Click the images to enlarge them.         The new Gmail features a task bar on the top-right by default, which hosts Keep for notes, Tasks – which lets you create tasks – and Calendar. There is also an option to get more add-ons, with a link to the G Suite Marketplace.
