SqwidNet, a wholly-owned subsidiary of DFA, is a premier network provider for the Internet of Things in South Africa. “SqwidNet came out of the need for DFA to innovate into the IoT world. It is based on the Sigfox standard, which is dedicated to connecting things through low-cost, low-power devices that monitor and respond to events in the environment,” said Phatizwe Malinga, SqwidNet Chief Solutions Officer. The network is highly pervasive and ultra-narrowband, allowing SqwidNet to create a platform that transmits and exchanges data between devices as well as with operators and users – all to make life easier, safer, more convenient, and more streamlined. In the following video Malinga, Acting CEO, former SqwidNet CEO Reshaad Sha, and Chief Technology Officer Andrew Heuvel explain how SqwidNet and Sigfox enable IoT in South Africa.
