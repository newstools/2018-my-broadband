The ANC held secret talks with the Oppenheimer family about a luxury private international terminal at OR Tambo International Airport. The Sunday Times reported that the talks between the ANC headquarters and the super-rich family discussed an application to operate the private terminal to the national government by one of the family’s businesses. “The ANC wrote to Nicky Oppenheimer to inform him his company Fireblade Aviation had “met the necessary requirements” and would be granted permission for the terminal,” the Sunday Times said. Two months after the letter by the ANC, the Department of Home Affairs gave the go-ahead for the private international terminal. The Sunday Times reported in November 2016 that the Oppenheimer family is fighting the Gupta family for control of the seven-star international airport terminal. Citing court papers, The Sunday Times said the “Oppenheimers claimed that the Guptas tried to use their influence over Denel to hijack the project”. The seven-star international airport terminal already exists and is controlled by the Oppenheimer Family’s Fireblade Aviation, but it did not have permission to operate international flights yet. Fireblade Aviation is the culmination of the Oppenheimer Family’s ambition to host a world-class facility for business aviation at OR Tambo International Airport. Fireblade Aviation offers the rich and famous special terminal facilities – which include customs and immigration, lounges, luxury suites, showers, a gym, a spa, and meeting rooms. The Oppenheimer family also offers visitors a full aircraft charter business. Below is a behind-the-scenes look at what the Fireblade Aviation terminal offers.
