Maingear launched its impressive F131 desktop gaming PC earlier this year, designed to push the limits of performance. The gaming rig is available in a number of configurations and can be outfitted with anything from a reasonable GPU and CPU, to insanely-powerful chips. Mid-range components like the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB are an option, but are wasted if used in this high-end machine. The Maingear F131 sports a custom-made liquid cooling system which is integrated into the chassis and is responsible for cooling most components. It also features a built-in RGB lighting system which can be customised to its owner’s specifications. The Maingear F131, and its various customisation options, is available for order from the Maingear website. To see what you can get if money is no object, however, we put together the top-of-the-range Maingear F131 – on paper. The specifications of the top-of-the-range F131 are below. This machine is an absolute beast. To see what it would cost to build this machine locally, we gathered the component pricicing of the F131 and listed it below. It must be noted that Nvidia’s Titan X Pascal is not available in South Africa, and we converted the price of the product on Amazon to rand and added estimated shipping costs. The build is structured to mimic the Maingear F131, including a custom liquid cooling system and Intel Core i9-7980XE processor. The price of the original Maingear F131 converted to rand is roughly R180,000, while the locally-sourced equivalent would be priced at R184,125. However, the custom build requires a fair amount of labour to assemble, thanks to the liquid cooling system, and lacks the unique design of the Maingear desktop. The Maingear F131’s cooling system is integrated into the chassis and it is available in a variety of finishes, colour schemes, and RGB configurations. Images of the Maingear F131 PC are posted below.
