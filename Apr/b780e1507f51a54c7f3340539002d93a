MyBroadband has released its Q1 2018 speed test results, which show that the average mobile download speed in South Africa is 20Mbps, while the average mobile upload speed is 9Mbps. The results are based on 142,537 speed tests which were performed by MyBroadband Android and iOS Speed Test app users. The install base for the Android and iOS Speed Test apps is currently at over 20,000 users. The speed tests came from users across the country, which included MyBroadband’s controlled drive tests. While the average speeds were excellent, not all South Africans enjoy this performance in their neighborhoods. Residents in major cities enjoy much higher speeds than their counterparts in rural areas. The suburb with the highest average speed in Q1 2018 was Gatesville in Cape Town, with an average download speed of 70Mbps. Two other Cape Town suburbs, Penlyn Estate and Cape Town CBD, were ranked second and third with 63Mbps and 60Mbps respectively. The table below shows the top 20 suburbs in Q1 2018, ranked according to average download speed.
