Microsoft has announced that OneNote for Windows 10 will replace OneNote 2016 as the default experience for Office 365 and Office 2019. OneNote users said they wanted a single version of OneNote on Windows that combines the benefits of the Windows app with the capabilities of OneNote 2016. In recent years, Microsoft has improved the performance and reliability of OneNote for Windows 10, and introduced a new sync engine which it will also bring to the app. “You don’t need to worry about being on the latest version since it’s always up-to-date via the Microsoft Store,” said Microsoft. OneNote 2016 will not receive new features or be installed by default, but will still be an option available to anyone with Office 365 or Office 2019. “If you currently use OneNote 2016, you won’t notice any changes when you update to Office 2019.” “We’ll continue to offer support, bug fixes, and security updates for OneNote 2016 for the duration of the Office 2016 support lifecycle, which runs through October 2020 for mainstream support.”
