Microsoft will announce a software development kit for 64-bit apps on its Windows on Snapdragon platform at its Build conference in May, Engadget reported. The SDK will allow developers to recompile their 64-bit apps to run natively on PCs powered by ARM-based chips. Windows 10 on Snapdragon can also run existing 32-bit apps compiled for Intel and AMD chips – the x86 architecture. This is done through emulation. A dynamic binary translator convert chunks of x86 code to ARM code, which is held in RAM or cache memory before being executed. Microsoft said its Office suite runs in emulation mode on Windows for Snapdragon, as recompiling it means losing access to an ecosystem of plugins that users depend on. Engadget reported that the ARM 64 SDK will be available for desktop and Microsoft Store apps.
