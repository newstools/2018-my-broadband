Amazon will expand its Career Choice programme to three new countries in 2018: South Africa, Costa Rica, and Slovakia. Career Choice is a programme that enables hourly associates with more than one year of tenure at Amazon to receive funding for further education in high-demand occupations. “We pre-pay 95% of tuition, fees, and textbooks (up to $12,000) for certificates and associate degrees in high-demand occupations, such as aircraft mechanics, computer-aided design, machine tool technologies, medical lab technologies, and nursing,” said Amazon. Commercial truck driving, healthcare, and information technology are the programme’s most popular fields of study. Over 16,000 associates have joined Career Choice since it launched in 2012 and the programme is currently live in 10 countries. “We’ve built 39 Career Choice classrooms so far, and we locate them behind glass walls in high traffic areas inside our fulfillment centers so associates can be inspired by seeing their peers pursue new skills,” said Amazon.
