IoT provider Sigfox and Louis Vuitton have released a luggage tracker that uses Sigfox technology. The luggage tracker is available with the Louis Vuitton Horizon luggage range and allows passengers to track their checked luggage in major airports. The luggage tracker is available as an accessory for the Louis Vuitton Horizon 50, 55, and 70 models and can easily be clipped into a pocket within the suitcase. Its low energy consumption also ensures a battery life of up to six months. The tracking device is the first to include Sigfoxâ€™s Monarch service that enables devices to run seamlessly in all parts of the world. This is achieved by the device automatically recognising and adapting to the local radio frequency standards. In South Africa, SqwidNet is rolling out a Sigfox network, which currently covers 83% of the population.
