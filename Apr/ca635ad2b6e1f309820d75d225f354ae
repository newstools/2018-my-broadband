ANN7 will rebrand to Afro Worldview on 30 April 2018. MultiChoice said the 24-hour news platform will air on DStv channel 405. “The channel will adopt a completely new look and feel, with a renewed editorial policy in line with the BCCSA code,” said MultiChoice. The channel will then stop broadcasting on DStv on 20 August, as the contract to broadcast ANN7 on DStv will not be renewed. “Afro Worldview is participating in the bidding process of the proposed new black-owned news channel on MultiChoice’s DStv platform.” Mzwanele Manyi, owner of Afrotone Media Holdings, said this is a strategic decision to “break away from the past of the previous channel ANN7”. The New Age newspaper will also be rebranded as Afro Voice, and its editorial policy will be in line with the press code. The bidding process to award a new black-owned news channel is still underway, and the winning bidder will be announced at the end of July, said MultiChoice.
