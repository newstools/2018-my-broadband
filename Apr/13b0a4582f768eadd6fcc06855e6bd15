Amazon has launched an Android web browser aimed at emerging markets. The browser is currently only available in India and is listed on the Google Play Store under the name “Internet: fast, lite and private”. The app promises to be “lighter than the competition”, with updates small enough that users can download them using mobile data. Its download size is only 2MB, much less than conventional browsers such as Google Chrome or Firefox. Amazon’s lite browser is compatible with Android 5.0 and newer operating systems, and includes features such as tab previews and private browsing.
