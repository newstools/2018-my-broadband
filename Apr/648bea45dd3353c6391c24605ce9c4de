Instagram has removed its Apple Watch app as part of the latest watchOS update, 9to5Mac reported. This follows Apple’s decision to stop accepting updates for apps which are not native to the watchOS 2 SDK or later. Due to its non-native construction, the Apple Watch Instagram app could not deliver direct messages or play videos – and did not work when not connected to an iPhone. Other companies have also removed their apps from the Apple Watch, including Slack, Twitter, and Google Maps.
