Google researchers have built an augmented reality microscope which could help doctors to diagnose cancer. The prototype is an ordinary light microscope which uses neural networks to detect cancer cells in images of human tissue. These images are relayed from a camera in the microscope to a computer which displays a real-time image of the tissue while detecting cancer cells. This hardware can also be retrofitted to existing light microscopes, allowing physicians to access the technology at a low cost. The video below provides a brief overview of the technology.
