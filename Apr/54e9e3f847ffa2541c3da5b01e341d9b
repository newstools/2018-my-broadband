Microsoft has announced that its AI-powered Translator tool can now be used offline on any smartphone. The company has released language packs for Translator which can be used across iOS and Android, without a data connection. This feature was previously only available on devices with high-end AI capabilities, but Microsoft said it has now optimised the tool to run on any device with a modern processor. The new language packs produce higher-quality translations, which are 50% smaller than the previous offline packs. Currently, the language packs are available in Translatorâ€™s most popular languages, with more to be added in the future.
