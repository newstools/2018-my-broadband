Google has launched its beta test for data calls through its Google Voice app, 9t05Google reported. Sign-ups for the Android beta are available through the Google support forum. One of the features currently available in the test is calls with your Google Voice number from any device where you have the app installed. Calls use approximately 0.2MB of data per minute, although this may vary â€“ depending on the bandwidth available and network quality. The web, Android, and iOS clients of Google Voice will be supported, but the data calling feature for iOS is still in development.
