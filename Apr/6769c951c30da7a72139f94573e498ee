Google will shut down its Play Music streaming service in favour of a new platform called YouTube Remix, Droid Life reported. Citing a source, the report stated that users will be migrated from Google Play Music onto YouTube Remix by the end of 2018. YouTube Remix is reportedly a combination of YouTube Music and the Play Music streaming services. YouTube Remix is intended to be a stronger competitor to industry leader Spotify, offering improved recommendations through a variety of mechanisms. These include features already in Play Music, such as smart playlists and time-of-day music recommendations. “We’ve previously announced the combination of the YouTube Music and Google Play product teams – music is very important to Google so it’s critical we have one offering that meets the needs of consumers and artists,” Google told Droid Life. “Nothing will change for users today and we’ll provide plenty of notice before any changes are made.”
