MyBroadband has released its Q1 2018 speed test statistics, which reveal the average speeds of South Africa’s top Internet service providers. The statistics used are based on over 1 million speed tests which were performed on MyBroadband’s HTML5 web-based speed test platform between 1 January and 31 March 2018. MyBroadband’s speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure a neutral testing environment. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to the MyBroadband Speed Test platform. The speed tests include fixed-line, wireless, and mobile connections from ISPs, which means the results are representative of multiple technologies.

From the results, the average speed per ISP was calculated – which differed significantly between business and consumer ISPs. When looking at the average speeds of local ISPs, it must be noted that different ISPs have very different clients. Telkom Internet, for example, has a large ADSL user base where the average speed is far lower than an ISP with mostly fibre clients, like Seacom. The table below provides an overview of the average download speeds, upload speeds, and latency of South Africa’s prominent ISPs.
