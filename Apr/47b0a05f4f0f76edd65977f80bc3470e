Speaking at a TED conference in Vancouver, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell said SpaceX’s rocket-based travel system could be up and running within a decade. Shotwell added that the company also plans to fly to Mars within this time frame. Both the Mars and suborbital travel endeavours will make use of SpaceX’s Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), which is currently under development. Shotwell said a ticket to fly via rocket to another city would be priced between economy and business class airline fares, although the flight time would be much shorter. She said this relatively low price would be attained by the efficiency and reusability of the company’s rockets.
