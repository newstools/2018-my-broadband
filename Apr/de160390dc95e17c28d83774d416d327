Microsoft has announced new protection capabilities coming to Office 365 Home and Personal subscribers. “With the growing presence of online threats like viruses, ransomware, and phishing scams, it’s important to have the right protection and tools to help protect yourself,” said Microsoft. The protection capabilities offer: Ransomware detection, recovery, and file restore start rolling out immediately, while password-protected sharing links, email encryption, and forwarding controls will start rolling out in the coming weeks. Advanced link checking and advanced attachment scanning is available in Outlook.com, and will launch for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint in 2018.
