Netflix and Amazon have joined a lawsuit against Set TV, which offers 500 channels of unlicensed content for $20 per month, Forbes reported. Other plaintiffs in the case include Columbia Pictures, Disney, Paramount, and Sony. The lawsuit was filed in California and claims $150,000 for each unlicensed movie and episode available for streaming on Set TV. According to the report, Set TV has apps for Kodi, Android, FireTV, and Nvidia Shield. The case against a streaming service comes after a group of 30 companies announced a partnership last year to fight piracy, called the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE). All the plaintiffs are on the ACE board.
