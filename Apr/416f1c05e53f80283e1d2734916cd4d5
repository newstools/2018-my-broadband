Microsoft has announced that its FreeSync feature is now available for testing on Xbox One. The company first said it would add FreeSync support to the console in March. FreeSync, developed by AMD, removes screen tearing by dynamically changing the refresh rate of a display to match the frames per second outputted by a GPU. To test the feature, users will need to be an Xbox Insider and have a monitor which supports FreeSync over HDMI. Qualifying users can enable FreeSync by toggling the “Allow variable refresh rate” option under the Advanced video menu.
