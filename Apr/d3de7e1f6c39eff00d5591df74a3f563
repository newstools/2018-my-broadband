MyBroadband has launched its latest South African Broadband Survey, which gives you the chance to rate your broadband provider. The survey also gives you a chance to express your interest in accessing fibre if you do not currently have coverage in your neighbourhood. The survey will only take 1 minute to complete, and you stand a chance to win R2,000 cash and other cool prizes. The survey closes on 16 April 2018.
