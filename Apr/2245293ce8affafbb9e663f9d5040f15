The first full week back at work after all these holidays and I feel like Steve Smith at a post-match press conference – ready to burst into tears and retire. I hope it will get easier next week, otherwise I might have to pull some yellow tape from my pocket and “influence” the surface of my face, claim chickenpox, and head home on Wednesday afternoon. To recover from the “long” week, treat yourself to a tech deal.
