President Cyril Ramaphosa and Gauteng Premier David Makhura are working towards scrapping the E-toll project, according to Rapport. Ramaphosa’s spokesperson said the president wants to find a solution to the E-toll issue as soon as possible. This is the latest indication that the E-toll system is close to being scrapped, the paper reported. “E-tolls are high on the president’s agenda and he expects there to be a definitive answer regarding government policy on the matter as soon as possible,” said the spokesperson. This follows Outa stating that only 30% of road users in Gauteng pay their E-tolls. This causes massive annual losses for Sanral, as the income from E-tolls is meant to fund a completed road infrastructure project worth R22 billion. Motorists reportedly owe Sanral R9 billion in this regard. Outa said it is a disgrace that Sanral is continuing to issue summonses to motorists for their outstanding E-toll debt, when it is clear the system is on its last legs. Sanral said it has issued 8,000 summonses. “Sanral is spending millions of rand on legal costs to terrorise people, while the entire system will be scrapped in the next few months,” said Outa.
