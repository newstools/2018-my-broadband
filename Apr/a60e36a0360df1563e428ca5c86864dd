Reddit has started deploying an update to the site’s design, Wired reported. This follows a post from Reddit CEO Steve Huffman in which he stated that Reddit was in need of the change. According to the report, Reddit’s new team of 20 designers worked on the redesign for the last year-and-a-half. Upon switching to the new design, subscribers will be presented with three different layout options: The new design also features a hamburger menu which can be used to access feeds, subreddit subscriptions, and profiles. Posts open in a modal, lightbox-like popup rather than linking to a new page. Only about 1% of Reddit users will initially see the new design, and it will be phased in during the coming months, stated the report.
