Google has confirmed a spam campaign impacting Gmail users, which caused a deluge of spam to appear in people’s inboxes. The messages were manipulated to look like they had been sent from Gmail users, 9to5Google reported. Following reports on its forum from affected users, Google released the following statement. We are aware of a spam campaign impacting a small subset of Gmail users and have actively taken measures to protect against it. This attempt involved forged email headers that made it appear as if users were receiving emails from themselves, which also led to those messages erroneously appearing in the Sent folder. Google said it has identified and is reclassifying all offending emails as spam, and has no reason to believe any accounts were compromised. Google said more information on how to report spam can be found by visiting its Help Center.
