Facebook is awash with people typing “BFF” in the comments sections of posts, which allegedly shows that your account is safe if the text displays in green. This is a hoax. This follows posts on Facebook containing this message: Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, invented the word BFF. To make sure your account is safe on Facebook, type BFF in a comment. If it appears green, your account is protected. If it does not appear in green, change your password immediately because it will be hacked. Fact-checking website Snopes investigated this claim and found it was false. Snopes pointed out that “it appeared to be based on a completely inaccurate inference about the site’s features”. Facebook has been experimenting with words which are displayed in different colours, and when users click on them it triggers an animation. In October 2017, Facebook added new words to its list which triggers animations, with BFF one of these words. “While Facebook comments including the word BFF in green are among known animations, its appearance – or lack thereof – is not related to account security in any way,” said Snopes.
