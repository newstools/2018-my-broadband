As the specifications and features of high-end smartphones continue to improve, their price tags remain high. At the lower price brackets, however, touchscreens, Android operating systems, and LTE connectivity can be obtained. These “cheap” devices can function as your primary or secondary phone, or as a mobile hotspot for high-speed data consumption. To see what is on offer in South Africa, we rounded up the best smartphones available for under R1,000. Pricing taken from Takealot. This Hisense is R699 and offers 3G connectivity paired with Android 6.0.  The Samsung Z2 boasts good specifications for its price and has support for LTE connectivity.  Vodacom’s Smart Mini 7 sports an LCD display and comes loaded with Android 6.0.  The Mobicel Vivo is a bit older than the others, but its camera resolution is quite decent.  Samsung’s J1 Mini Prime contends with the Nokia 1 for best value for money. Offering LTE connectivity, Android, and a 5MP rear camera, this device is cheap and packs great features.  The new Nokia 1 will ship with Android 8.1 Go, optimised for low-RAM devices. It sports an LCD display and LTE connectivity, and its large battery should provide impressive endurance.
