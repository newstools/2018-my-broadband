Facebook has revealed there were South African users whose data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica. This follows reports that the firm obtained the data of 50 million profiles, in violation of Facebook’s rules. The data was obtained through an a app called “thisisyourdigitallife”, a personality test which was developed by Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan. Facebook users who used the app shared information about their Facebook friends in the process, resulting in the data of people being collected. Kogan then shared the data with Cambridge Analytica, and Facebook said this was against its terms of use. According to Facebook, 33 users in South Africa installed Kogan’s app. In total, 59,777 users were potentially impacted in South Africa. These include friends of those who would have installed the app elsewhere in the world. “Everyone globally on their Facebook page will see an alert leading them to the apps setting where they can review the apps they’ve allowed to access to their data,” said Facebook. “Additionally, those potentially impacted by Cambridge Analytica will also see the alert with additional language which will then take them to see what data might have been shared.”
