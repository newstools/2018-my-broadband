Telkom will launch 200Mbps fibre packages in the coming months, the company told MyBroadband. Telkom will offer 200Mbps packages on Openserve fibre, which are set to be unveiled before the end of June 2018. “Product details will be available during the launch period,” said Telkom. The announcement follows Openserve starting to offer 200Mbps fibre wholesale services to ISPs in recent weeks. Previously, ISPs selling Openserve fibre services offered a maximum of 100Mbps down and 50Mbps up on a line. The new offering from Openserve sees ISPs offering 200Mbps down and 100Mbps up.
