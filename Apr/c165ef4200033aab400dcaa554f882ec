A courier will perform a basic assessment to check the following conditions : You do not need to include the charger or accessories that came with your device. Brightstar will then take the device to perform a secondary assessment, after which you will receive an SMS confirmation code to redeem at a Samsung Store. Vouchers are not transferable, and the full value of the voucher must be redeemed. Any part of the trade-in value you donâ€™t use expires when you leave the store.
