Google has unveiled a new design for Gmail, which features a more modern and cleaner look. Google said the new Gmail features “a brand new look on the web, advanced security features, new applications of Google’s artificial intelligence, and even more integrations with other G Suite apps”. The company said data security is an important consideration for it, and recently-introduced protections in Gmail have helped block 99.9% of Business Email Compromise threats. Now Gmail has added a “confidential mode”, which lets users protect sensitive content in emails by creating expiration dates or revoking previously-sent messages. “Because you can require additional authentication via text message to view an email, it’s also possible to protect data even if a recipient’s email account has been hijacked while the message is active,” said Google. “Built-in information rights management controls also allow you to remove the option to forward, copy, download, or print messages.” Google said it has also redesigned its security warnings in Gmail, so information is easier to see and understand. “These bigger, bolder warnings will help you be even more informed when it comes to potentially risky email,” it said. When it comes to regular email usage, Google said it has redesigned the Gmail web application to help users take action quicker. “Now you can see and click attachments in your inbox before ever opening a thread. You can also hover over messages to do things like RSVP to a meeting invite, archive an email thread, or snooze an email until the time is right,” said Google. Google said users can access the new Gmail by clicking the Settings cog icon on the top-right of their Gmail page, and selecting “Try the new Gmail”. Images of the new design are posted below.
