Linus Torvalds has started the development cycle of the Linux 4.17 kernel series, according to a report by Softpedia. The first Release Candidate build has been released, and comes two weeks after the launch of Linux 4.16. “Public testers can start downloading, compiling, and installing the upcoming Linux 4.17 kernel,” stated the report. Torvalds said the latest release won’t include any major new features, adding that the next big release will be called Linux 5.0. “The most special thing that happened is purely numerology: we’ve passed the six million git objects mark, and that is reason enough to call the next kernel 5.0,” said Torvalds.
