China’s Tiangong-1 space station has burnt up in earth’s atmosphere over the South Pacific, Space.com reported. The prototype space lab featured two main parts: a module that housed visiting astronauts, and a module that held its solar energy and propulsion systems. The space station was launched in 2011 and had a lifespan of two years. While its primary mission was completed in 2013, it remained in orbit and in contact with earth until March 2016. Researchers and engineers then lost contact with the station, resulting in the conclusion that an uncontrolled re-entry into earth’s atmosphere was inevitable. Chinese officials disputed the term “uncontrolled”, however, and insist the re-entry was controlled. The station could not fire its engines, and the European Space Agency had to provide a “probability map” of where it would re-enter. The final impact point could initially have been anywhere between 42.8 degrees North and 42.8 degrees South in latitude.
