Google has added a number of pet-focused features to its Photos app for National Pet Day. The features include the ability to identify popular cat or dog breeds using Google Lens preview. When users take a picture of a dog or cat with Google Lens enabled, the software will automatically identify the breed of the animal in frame. Google Photos can now also automatically create a photo book of your pet by using machine learning to select the best pictures you have taken. Photos also allows users to search their image library for pets by breed, species, and emoji.
