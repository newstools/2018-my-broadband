Android 6.0, 7.0, and 7.1 have over 50% of Android device market share, according to Google. Google’s latest Android figures show that Android 6.0 Marshmallow has a 26% share, with 7.0 and 7.1 on 23% and 7.8% respectively. Android 8.0 and 8.1 – nicknamed Android Oreo, and the latest version of the operating system – are on 4.1% and 0.5% respectively. Other versions of the OS which have significant share include Android 5.1 on 18% and Android 4.4 on 10.5%. A possible reason for the large share of the older operating systems is that device manufacturers or mobile networks have failed to push OS updates for certain Android smartphones.
