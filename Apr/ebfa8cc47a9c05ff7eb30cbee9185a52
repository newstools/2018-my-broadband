Microsoft has released its Windows Defender Browser ProtectionÂ extension for Google Chrome, which protects users against online threats. The real-time protection from Microsoft guards against phishing emails and websites designed to trick users into downloading and installing malicious software that can harm their PC. If you click a malicious link in an email or navigate to a malicious site, Windows Defender Browser Protection will check it against a dynamic list of malicious URLs known to Microsoft. If the malicious link matches one on the list, Windows Defender Browser Protection will show a red warning screen, letting you know that the web page is harmful. It will then give users a path back to safety with one click. https://browserprotection.microsoft.com/img/Bank_Phishing.mp4
