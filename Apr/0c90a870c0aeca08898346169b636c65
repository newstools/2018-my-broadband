Sony has announced a PlayStation VR price cut for South Africa. The move follows an international price cut for the PSVR system. The PSVR starter pack is now available for a recommended price of R4,799 – down from R5,999. “PSVR will continue to expand with highly-anticipated launches on their way, including Blood & Truth, WipEout Omega Collection, and Firewall Zero Hour,” said Sony. When the PSVR launched in South Africa in January 2017, it was selling for R6,500 without a camera.
