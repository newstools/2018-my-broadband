WhatsApp is updating its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy where the law known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is taking effect. This was done as the European Union is updating its privacy laws to require greater transparency on how people’s information is used online. As part of the changes, WhatsApp has updated its age restrictions for using the service in Europe. Additionally, If a user is not old enough to have authority to agree to WhatsApp’s terms in their country, their parent or guardian must agree on their behalf.
