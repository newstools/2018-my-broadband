Apple recently launched a new iPad aimed at the education sector, called “the new iPad”. The device is a refreshed version of the previous 9.7-inch iPad, with modern features and improved performance. Following the launch, iFixit examined the new device – and said the new iPad could be a nightmare to repair yourself. “As in all iPads, a solid barrier of very strong adhesive bars the way to any repairs, and makes rework a sticky proposition,” said iFixit. iFixit said the LCD display has foam tape adhering it to the front panel, but it is easy to remove once you have separated the digitizer from the panel. The teardown specialists rated the device a 2 out of 10 on the repairability scale, due to the liberal use of glue throughout its components.
