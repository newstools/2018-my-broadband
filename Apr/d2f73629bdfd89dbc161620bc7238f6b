Microsoft has released the source code for its original Windows File Manager. The code is available on GitHub and brings back the interface which was originally released with Windows 3.0 in the 1990s. The GitHub post states that Windows File Manager runs as a native x86 and x64 desktop app on all currently-supported version of Windows, including Windows 10. Windows File Manager is described as a “single-instance graphical interface”, which replaced the command-line interface of MS-DOS. This let users manage files, with actions common by today’s standards – including copy, open, delete, and search.
