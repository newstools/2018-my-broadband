On 24 April 1990, the shuttle mission STS-31 carried the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. Decades later, the telescope is still taking pictures and NASA celebrated its 28th birthday with images of the Lagoon nebula. “At the centre of the photo, a monster young star 200,000 times brighter than our Sun is blasting powerful ultraviolet radiation and hurricane-like stellar winds, carving out a fantasy landscape of ridges, cavities, and mountains of gas and dust,” said NASA. “The giant star, called Herschel 36, is bursting out of its natal cocoon of material, unleashing blistering radiation and torrential stellar winds that push dust away in curtain-like sheets. This action resembles the Sun bursting through the clouds at the end of an afternoon thunderstorm that showers sheets of rainfall.” NASA describes the Lagoon Nebula as “a vast stellar nursery” which is located 4,000 light-years away and is visible with binoculars as only a smudge of light with a bright core.    <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
