Mozilla has unveiled Firefox Reality, a web browser designed for standalone VR headsets. “We took our existing Firefox web technology and enhanced it with Servo, our experimental web engine,” it said. “From the Servo team, who recently joined the Mixed Reality team, we will gain the ability to experiment with entirely new designs and technologies for seeing and interacting with the immersive web.” Firefox Reality will be open source and will take steps to ensure user privacy, it added. “We don’t yet have all the answers for what privacy looks like in this new medium, but we are committed to finding the solution.” According to Mozilla, Firefox Reality will be the first cross-platform browser for mixed reality, and the only open source one. Mozilla said it will release regular updates on its work in the coming weeks, including: <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
