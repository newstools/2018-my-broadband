Valve has removed the Steam Machines section from the front page of its Steam online marketplace, PC Gamer reported. This has led to speculation that the company will do away with the PC hardware from its website. While the Steam Machines page can still be reached, it is not accessible through the Steam app. PC Gamer also noted that Steam’s old page for the hardware is gone and was replaced with a search list of four Steam Machines – with links to external websites. Hovering over the “hardware” tab in Steam only brings up the sections for the Steam Controller, Steam Link, and HTC Vive.
