Teraco has passed 12,000 interconnects and is growing at a rate of 500 interconnects per quarter. The company said this makes it much easier for its clients to do business and exchange information across Africa. Teraco is also host to NAPAfrica, Africa’s largest peering exchange, which is located in the company’s Cape Town, Durban, and Johannesburg data centres. “The resulting interconnection density within Teraco, alongside NAPAfrica’s drive to bring global content to a local distribution point, has resulted in lower Internet access costs for South Africa and many other sub-Saharan countries,” it said. “Most large international content providers now co-locate within Teraco’s data centres, resulting in a much better user experience and lower costs.” Teraco said is currently working with certain clients to enhance its Teraco Interconnection Platform, which aims to lower costs and increase agility going forward.
