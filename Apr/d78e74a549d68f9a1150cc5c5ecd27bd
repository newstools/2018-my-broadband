PC gaming is where all the action is, easily outshining console and smartphone gaming, according to Nvidia. The GPU maker made the statement during its recent 2018 Investor Day presentation. Nvidia used the presentation to detail how it is performing in the gaming market and what it predicts for the segment going forward – with the company very positive in both regards. Gaming had a great year, said Nvidia, highlighting its strong performance in the market. It stated that the total gaming market grew by 36% year-on-year, to a total of almost $6 billion. Nvidia’s exposure to the gaming market is via various products it offers, including its GeForce GTX graphics cards, its work on Max-Q gaming notebooks, and its chips running in the wildly-popular Nintendo Switch. The company also stated that gaming revenue, the number of gamers, and the amount of “gamers for life” have all increased over the past 10 years.  Nvidia attributed the strong growth of the PC gaming segment to multiple factors, including the fact that it is an “open platform”. The number of games and the number of developers choosing to make games for PC were also contributors to the performance. The number of games for PC in 2017 far outranked rival platforms, including the PlayStation, by a substantial margin.  The continued rise of PC gaming bodes well for Nvidia, which said its GeForce platform – under which its high-end gaming graphics chips are sold – is dominating the scene. Nvidia highlighted two standout figures during its presentation: The company stated that the number of professional gaming organisations and players is also on the rise. Esports audiences and prize money for tournaments has grown concurrently with its professional player base – with titles like Overwatch and League of Legends the headline acts.
