Microsoft has unveiled the latest update to Windows 10. The “Windows 10 April 2018 Update” is aimed at “giving back some of your greatest currency, your time”. The main feature of the update is Timeline, which lets users go back in time up to 30 days on their Widows 10 PC. “Because much of our activity is on the go, you can even pick up what you were doing if signed into your Microsoft account while using Microsoft Edge or Office 365 on your iOS or Android device when you return to your Windows 10 PC,” said Microsoft. “Imagine looking at bathroom vanity options for that home remodel when you’re out and about on your phone, and then finishing that purchase when you’re back at your PC. Or working on a document on the bus during your commute and seamlessly picking it back up when you’re at your desk.” Microsoft has also introduced Focus Assist in the update, which can be set to turn on at certain times of the day, or manually, when you need to concentrate. It stops distractions, like social media notifications or emails, and then provides a summary of what came through to your PC when the assistant is turned off. Another feature added is an improved Dictation function, which lets users speak to their PC and have it type out the words. Updates to the functionality of the Edge browser have also been added, including the ability to mute tabs. The April 2018 Update will be available as a free download from 30 April. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
