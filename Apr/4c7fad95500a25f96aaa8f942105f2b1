Phathizwe Malinga has been appointed as the interim CEO of SqwidNet, following the resignation of Reshaad Sha. Sha resigned from both his position as CEO of SqwidNet and chief strategy officer of Dark Fibre Africa (DFA) to take on the role as CEO of Liquid Telecom South Africa. Vino Govender is now serving as the acting chief strategy officer for Dark Fibre Africa. “Reshaad contributed widely to the success of the DFA group during his tenure, being a key contributor to formulating our short, mid, and long-term strategies, formalising the DFA product set and directing the expansion into managed services, establishing stronger public-sector relationships, and leading DFA’s entry into FTTH,” said DFA CEO Thinus Mulder. “We wish Reshaad luck in his future endeavours and hope that he finds the same success that he enjoyed during his time with us.”
