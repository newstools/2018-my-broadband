The fastest-growing course in UC Berkeley’s history – Foundations of Data Science – is being offered for free online through the education hub edX. The course covers everything from testing hypotheses to applying statistical inferences, all while coding in Python and using real-world data sets. It is based on the Foundations of Data Science course that Berkeley launched in 2015 and now has over 1,000 students enrolling every semester. “The intent is helping students to address questions that interest them, using the powerful tools of data science,” said Berkeley. “Anyone in the world can enroll for free, but learners who want to earn the certificate will need to pay,” it said.
