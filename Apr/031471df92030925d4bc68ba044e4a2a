Wikipedia has added page previews for desktop users, which is one of the largest changes the website has made in recent years. The page previews feature allows users to get a quick grasp of what’s behind a link without committing to a click-through. Page previews solves the problem of readers needing to go back and forth between articles or opening multiple tabs to gain an understanding of a word or concept. Wikipedia said the goal of page previews is to decrease the cost of exploration for each blue link a reader comes across. Readers can now easily satisfy their curiosity or clarify a confusing or unknown topic without the burden of opening a new page and navigating back to the original. Users can now hover their cursor over hyperlinked text in a Wikipedia page to read the first few sentences and see an image. “You can then decide if you’d like to click through to read even more,” it said.
