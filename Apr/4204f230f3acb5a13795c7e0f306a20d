Austrian startup Rebeat Innovation has received funding to create high-definition vinyl records, Pitchfork reports. The startup has received $4.8 million to create records using a new vinyl manufacturing process which allows for higher audio fidelity than traditional records. Using this process, digital audio is converted to a 3D topographic map which is then inscribed by laser onto the vinyl stamper. This manufacturing process produces more precise grooves in the vinyl with less data loss, allowing for up to 30% more play time and better sound production for each LP. According to the report, the new high-definition records could be in stores next year.
