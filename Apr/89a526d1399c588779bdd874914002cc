Windows Defender and other anti-virus applications flagged the uTorrent BitTorrent client as “potentially unwanted software” this week, TorrentFreak reported. BitTorrent regarded the warnings as false positives, but stopped offering a version of the software for download. The reason for the issue has not been confirmed, but TorrentFreak speculated it may be related to Lavasoft’s Ad-Aware. BitTorrent said it believes Windows Defender’s previous passive flag of uTorrent changed to active with a Microsoft “patch Tuesday” update. Only a small percentage of users are affected, said BitTorrent. “We had three uTorrent executables being served from our site. [One], which was going to 5% of users, was part of the Windows block. We stopped shipping that and confirmed we are no longer seeing any blocks.”
