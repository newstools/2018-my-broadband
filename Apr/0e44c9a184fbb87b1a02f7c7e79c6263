The New York Times has reported that credit card networks will stop requiring users to sign credit card slips when they purchase goods. According to the report, American Express, Discover, Mastercard, and Visa have conceded that signatures are poor to prove identity. The change, however, is optional, and it is up to retailers to decide whether they want to force shoppers to sign slips. In October 2017, Mastercard said it was doing away with the need to sign your name when paying with a credit or debit card. The company said the change will take effect in the US and Canada from April 2018. American Express followed suit in December 2017, eliminating the collection of signatures for transactions from April 2018. This move will provide a simplified checkout experience for merchants and card holders, it said.
