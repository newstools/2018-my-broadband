Google has updated its YouTube TV live streaming platform to support Firefox, according to the support page for the service. This means YouTube TV subscribers will now be able to use the service in the Firefox web browser on desktop. Firefox is the first browser to get YouTube TV support after Googleâ€™s Chrome browser. The support page states that Google is working to bring YouTube TV support to more desktop browsers in the future. Google recently increased the price of YouTube TV subscriptions to $40 per month after adding live sports channels.
