Whether you’re gaming on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, or PC, your experience is limited or enhanced by the display you use. This is especially true for TVs, where resolution, viewing distance, and response time can play significant roles in the player’s experience. When buying a TV for gaming, it is important to keep these factors in mind – along with the capabilities of your console or PC. Most high-end TVs boast UHD resolutions and HDR support these days, but the lesser-advertised specifications like input lag and I/O layout can make the difference between a decent TV and a good gaming display. We’ve outlined the basic specifications to look out for, regardless of which platform you game on, below. Response time and input lag are key elements of a good gaming TV, as they can drastically affect a player’s performance in fast-paced games. Unlike monitors, TVs have quite a high response time which can impact latency and make controls feel sluggish. For this reason, buyers should pick a product with low input lag and good response time specifications. Connectivity is also important, as gamers will need to connect their devices and peripherals to their new TV. Ensure that your TV has enough HDMI or other display ports to connect all your hardware, with room to spare for anything you may need to connect to the display. A Bluetooth connection is also an advantage, as it can be used to connect third-party controllers or wireless headsets, when using the TV on its own. 4K and HDR are also requirements for future-proofing your gaming, especially on a large-panel display. In terms of panel types, OLED provides better contrast ratios and less motion blur than an LCD, but the latter does not suffer from burn-in and is significantly cheaper. Based on these specifications, we’ve listed great 4K TVs for gaming available in South Africa below.
