LG has opened its new Software Upgrade Center in South Korea, aimed at providing customers worldwide with faster smartphone operating system and software updates. The Upgrade Center will develop and deliver regular OS updates for LG smartphones. It will also be responsible for ensuring a consistent user experience on LG devices by testing the stability and compatibility between hardware and software after updates. “The creation of the centre will enable LG to roll out OS updates faster in countries where LG smartphones are available,” it said. One of the first initiatives of the Software Upgrade Center will be to roll out Android 8.0 for the LG G6 later this month.
