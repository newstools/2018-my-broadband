Toll fees have risen by between 6-7% across South Africa, putting financial pressure on motorists, said the AA. The latest toll increases are effective from April 2018 and come at a time when fuel prices are reaching close to all-time highs. “The financial weight of all of these increases is not sustainable,” said the AA. At the start of April, fuel levies increased by 52 cents per litre and VAT increased by one percentage point to 15%. The AA said there is a strong possibility of a petrol price hike occuring in May, due to the weakening rand and international petrol price increases. It said the increases are counter-productive, given SANRAL’s admission in Parliament in 2017 that the compliance rate for e-toll users was only around 30%. “If the majority of users are already not paying, how is increasing the tolls on this road specifically going to ensure more compliance?” said the AA. A comparison of the historical toll fees from Soweto to Pretoria were summarised by the AA below.
