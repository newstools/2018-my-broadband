Valve has acquired Campo Santo, the independent studio behind Firewatch, Ars Technica reported. Valve boss Gabe Newell said during a media briefing last month that the company was back in the business of making and shipping games. He was showing off Artifact, a digital card game developed with the creator of Magic: The Gathering. Campo Santo said its 12-person team has agreed to join Valve and relocate to its headquarters in Washington. It will continue to work on its upcoming game In the Valley of the Gods. It will also continue to support Firewatch. “We really like making video games. Furthermore, and perhaps more accurately, we really like making and producing entertainment,” said Campo Santo. “In Valve we found a group of folks who, to their core, feel the same way about the work.”
