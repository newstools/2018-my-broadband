Twitter said it is committed to ensuring that the information users receive is credible and authentic. It stated in a blog post that one of its goals is to provide support to people in times of crisis, and show people what matters most. One of the biggest challenges is people sharing fake news or information, which is aimed at deceiving readers, it added. The company said over the past few months, it has refined its tools, improved the speed of its response, and identified areas where it can improve. Twitter also shared information on how it is dealing with people who are manipulating the conversation around an attack at the YouTube headquarters. “There are various policies we rely on in these types of situations, but we do not have a policy under which Twitter validates content authenticity or accuracy,” it said. “We believe Twitter should not be the arbiter of truth. However, we do see information shared that violates many of our existing policies.” Twitter subsequently started requiring account owners to remove Tweets for violating its policies on abusive behaviour. “We also suspended hundreds of accounts for harassing others or purposely manipulating conversations about the event,” said Twitter.
