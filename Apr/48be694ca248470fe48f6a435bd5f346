The main reason for the recent downtime of the SA Post Office website was the suspension of its domain due to non-payment. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg that is the organisation’s problems. The website was down for several days, and emails sent to @postoffice.co.za addresses bounced. This downtime was disruptive for users and further hurt the organisation’s poor reputation. The reason for the downtime is of concern, as the domain name renewal fee was R125.40 and the payment was outstanding for several weeks. Calvin Browne, cofounder of DNS Africa and head of international registrar relations at Domain Name Services, explained the situation in detail. Browne highlighted the following in the buildup to the downtime: The lack of payment was not the only issue, however. Browne said the website remained down after the payment, as there were several errors with the “postoffice.co.za” zone setup. He said the problems which were uncovered made it “quite remarkable that anything works at all” and contributed to the extended downtime. Browne gave a detailed explanation of these problems, which included: Browne further uncovered that certain Internet Solutions nameservers are used for the postoffice.co.za domain. However, when he tested the IS nameservers, they responded with “SERVFAIL”, which “basically means they know nothing about postoffice.co.za”. “Basically, you have a bunch of misconfigurations in the postoffice.co.za domain, with errors across all of the listed nameservers,” said Browne. “Two of five registered nameservers do not even know about the domain, and all of the ones that do answer contain weird nonsensical nameservers. And two of the nameservers cannot be trusted to serve the correct information.” Browne said it is “no wonder things took so long to come back up once the domain was reinstated”. Alarm bells should ring at the Post Office, as these errors appear to be replicated on “postbank.co.za” and other Post Office domains.
