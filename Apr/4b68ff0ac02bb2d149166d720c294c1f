Law enforcement agencies from the US and UK have taken down Webstresser.org, a DDoS attack service, the BBC reported. Seven suspects behind the website were arrested or subject to searches in the Netherlands, UK, Canada, and other countries. Dutch police completed the operation on Wednesday by finding the website’s servers and seizing them. According to a statement from Europol, its infrastructure was seized in the Netherlands, the US, and Germany. The site has been replaced with a page announcing “Operation Power Off”. Europol stated that measures were also taken against the top users of the Webstresser marketplace in several countries. While it did not reveal who the operators of Webstresser.org were, KrebsOnSecurity released the name of a 19 year-old from Serbia as the alleged administrator.
