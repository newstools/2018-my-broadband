Uber has opened a new Greenlight Hub in Sandton to cater for the needs of its drivers. The building is a one-stop-shop for Uber drivers, offering them facilities to register on the platform, attend training courses, and more. Uber said its new building can serve up to 1,800 driver-partners per day and is the company’s flagship Greenlight Hub on the continent. Drivers visiting the Greenlight Hub are serviced by a team of Uber experts, who aid them with anything from payment queries to app usage training. Facilities inside the building include a training room for onboarding new drivers, a service area where drivers can resolve queries and complete documentation, and a free coffee station. Ground floor space is also devoted to partners who offer discounted cellphone insurance, fuel vouchers, health insurance, and more. “We aim for driver-partners to have the best customer experience enhanced by solid processes, well-trained experts, and cutting-edge technology,” said Uber GM for Sub-Saharan Africa, Alon Lits. ” “We are proud to say that on average, 90% of driver-partner issues are resolved within their first visit.” MyBroadband visited the Uber Greenlight Hub in Johannesburg, with photos of the new building below.
