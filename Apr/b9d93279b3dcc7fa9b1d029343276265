Thanks to the availability of international content at local peering locations in South Africa, Internet service providers can now offer cheap, fast uncapped fibre services in the country. On top of these low costs, telecommunications company Activate Telecoms is running an awesome special on their 100Mbps uncapped connectivity package. Customers can now get a 100Mbps line from Activate Telecoms – along with a TV and a smart box to stream and manage Wi-Fi – for only R8,999 pm (excl. vat). The 100Mbps line works across all five major last-mile providers, and customers can also NUP (number port) their current voice provider to Activate’s voice platform on SIP. With Activate Telecoms, customers can deliver a presentation without any hiccups, as no more projectors or cables will be required in the boardroom. Activate Telecoms utilises cutting-edge technology, complimented by South Africa’s most innovative networks – such as Liquid and Telkom – to provide the most efficient and cost-effective solutions.
