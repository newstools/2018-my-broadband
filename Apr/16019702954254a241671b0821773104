Google said it is working on major updates to Gmail, but is keeping details confidential at this stage. The Verge, citing an email to G Suite administrators, said the Gmail redesign will include “several new features”. Google promises a “fresh, clean look for Gmail on the web,” with features like Smart Reply, snooze emails, and offline support. Engadget reported that a redesigned Gmail will be rolled out to the Early Adopter Program for Gmail and G Suite users in the coming weeks. The changes will reportedly also include easy access to G Suite apps from within Gmail. Users can also look forward to native offline support for Gmail, which will result in the termination of the Gmail Offline Chrome app.
