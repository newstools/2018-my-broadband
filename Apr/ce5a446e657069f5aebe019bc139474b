Vodacom is the first African mobile network to exceed 80% population coverage on 4G, the company announced. “Vodacom now provides 80.12% 4G coverage in South Africa, with 99.78% of the population covered by 3G and 99.97% covered by 2G,” it said. Accelerated rural coverage has been a significant contributor to providing South Africans with the widest coverage, it added. “Ulundi in KwaZulu-Natal now enjoys the same 4G signal as Vodacom subscribers who live in the heart of Johannesburg.” Vodacom has invested R39 billion in its network in South Africa over the past five years, and Vodacom Chief Technology Officer Andries Delport said this allowed for the vast coverage. “Despite the ongoing spectrum constraints… our aim is to expand our network coverage to all parts of the country, including remote rural areas.” Access to new, sub-1GHz spectrum will enable a more cost-effective rollout of 4G, said Vodacom.
