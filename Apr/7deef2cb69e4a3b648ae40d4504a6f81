Many businesses opt for Fibre-to-the-Home (FTTH) instead of Fibre-to-the-Business (FTTB) because it seems to be more cost-effective – but you get what you pay for. FTTB has several advantages over FFTH, including wider coverage, better contention ratios, complex security, and clearly-defined service level agreements (SLAs). According to Nashua, “Businesses require more out of their connectivity than most home users. This could be access to static IP addresses, advanced security measures, or complex routing of their data. With an FTTB service, these customisations or requirements will in most cases be catered for and offered to the customer. FTTH services forgo many of these features to offer a reduced price point.” To allow businesses to experience the FTTB difference, Nashua is offering free installations to the first 100 customers who sign up with Nashua Connectivity during the month of April.
