Mayor Eric Garcetti has announced that SpaceX will construct its BFR (Big Falcon Rocket) in Los Angeles. SpaceX’s massive rocket will be able to carry a payload of up to 50 tons to celestial bodies as far away as Mars. The rocket is designed to be reusable and will also be used to transport humans across Earth faster than ever before. The space company has signed a 30-year lease for a site in LA and has begun moving equipment there to set up a manufacturing facility. “This vehicle holds the promise of taking humanity deeper into the cosmos than ever before,” said Garcetti.
