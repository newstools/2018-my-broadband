YouTube has announcedÂ it will bring a number of improved parental control features to its Kids app this year. YouTube now offers a selection of trusted channels across a variety of topics, which are created by its Kids team and partners. Parents can select the trusted channels by navigating to Profile Settings and choosing from the available collections. The platform will also roll out a parent-approved content feature later this year. This will allow parents to handpick videos and channels available to their child from the YouTube Kids app. Additionally, from this week, turning off the search function in YouTube Kids will limit the experience to verified channels. These channels are verified by the YouTube Kids team and there will be no recommendations shown which point to content outside verified channels.
