ISPA has announced that iWeek 2018 will be held in Cape Town from 20-24 August 2018. The conference has been held every year for 17 years and attracts speakers and experts from around the world. Most conference sessions are open to the public and are free to attend for pre-registered delegates. The event is being held earlier than usual to accommodate its new partners, the Internet Society and the African IXP Association. The ninth annual African Peering and Interconnection Forum (AfPIF) will also be hosted at iWeek this year, connecting infrastructure, service, and content providers to expand the African Internet. iWeek 2018 will be hosted at the Westin Hotel in Cape Town, and attendees can register on the official website.
