Itâ€™s the weekend before payday. It is also the weekend before payday after the Easter long weekend. I would be surprised if you had money for bread, let alone tech. But if you do have money to spend, then there is no better time to shop than this weekend. No queues, no fights over the last item in stock, and plenty of time to plug your USB into TVs and play your copy of Pirates of the Caribbean to see the screen quality.
