Steam has updated its performance statistics for the most popular Internet service providers connecting to its platform. South Africans downloaded 565.9TB from Steam at an average rate of 6.6Mbps last week, said Valve. This accounted for 0.2% of the total traffic downloaded from the platform during the period. SteamSpy reported that over the past two weeks, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was the Steam game with the highest number of players in South Africa. The table below ranks the most popular ISPs in South Africa accessing Steam, based on the number of bytes delivered to that network from Steam. Steam does not detail theÂ number of bytes delivered, however, but does show the average download rates of the ISPs.
