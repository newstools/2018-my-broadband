Vodacom shut down the Vodacom World mall in Midrand for renovations on 17 March, and stated that it will remain closed until late 2018. Shortly after the announcement, iStore revealed that it was holding a closing sale for its outlet in Vodacom World. This raised the question: will all the stores in Vodacom World reopen after the shutdown is over? And what will the mall look like at the end of the year, in terms of its stores and floorspace? Vodacom declined to directly answer questions about is plans for stores following the renovations, but did reveal it would be “moving away from the traditional tenant model”. It said the overall philosophy of the Vodacom World revamp is to create exclusive and first-to-market digital experiences with various partnerships. “We’re not letting go of everything, as we intend to build on our reputation of being the best-in-class cellular retailer,” Vodacom told MyBroadband. Its goal with the renovation is to combine retail with experiential opportunities. Vodacom said it aims to reinvigorate its leadership position of being the first to launch in South Africa, showcasing the latest consumer technologies, and activating amazing product demos. “We understand that accelerating technological change can be overwhelming,” said Vodacom. “We’ve heard our customers’ calls for more collaborative, empowering conversations and advice, so we’re responding by designing experiential journeys with our customers at the centre of all we do to humanise technology and create personalised connections.”
