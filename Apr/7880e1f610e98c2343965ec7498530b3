Twitter has pledged to support the Honest Ads Act. The Honest Ads Act is a bill in the US to promote the regulation of political campaign advertisements online. “We believe the Honest Ads Act provides an appropriate framework for such ads and look forward to working with bill sponsors,” said Twitter. This follows Twitter’s announcement last year that it will launch the Ads Transparency Center (ATC). The ATC will provide increased transparency for all advertisements on Twitter, it said. “Moreover, the ATC will dramatically increase transparency for political and issue ads, providing people with significant detail on the origin of each ad.” The ATC is set to launch later this year.
