MultiChoice’s annual price adjustments for DStv are live. The pay-TV broadcaster increased its prices today, 1 April 2018. It must be noted that this is not an April Fools’ joke – DStv announced the price increases in February. As in 2017, DStv Access and DStv EasyView prices did not increase. MultiChoice elected to increase its Access Fee price by nearly 6%, however, after leaving it unchanged last year. MultiChoice said it did its best to keep subscription fees down in 2017, despite the tough economic climate. The DStv price hikes which kick in today are detailed below.
