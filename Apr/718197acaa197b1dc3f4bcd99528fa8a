To diagnose whether an issue is caused by Site Isolation, use chrome://flags#site-isolation-trial-opt-out. The company has requested users to report any issues specific to the Site Isolation trial to help fix it before the feature is launched broadly. Chrome 66 will also not trust website certificates issued by Symantec’s legacy public key infrastructure before 1 June 2016.
