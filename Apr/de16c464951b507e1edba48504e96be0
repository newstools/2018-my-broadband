Instagram has announced plans for a data portability tool which lets you download your data from the platform, TechCrunch reported. “You’ll soon be able to download a copy of what you’ve shared on Instagram, including your photos, videos, and messages,” it said. The news comes after Facebook was embroiled in controversy due to reports that data leaked from the platform to Cambridge Analytica was used to advise the Donald Trump presidential campaign and Brexit. Cambridge Analytica has denied the allegations, saying it used data gathered on its own for the Trump campaign, and wasn’t involved in Brexit. Instagram’s owners Facebook did not announce when the tool will arrive, but the report noted that if it launches before 25 May it will help the app comply with European privacy laws.
