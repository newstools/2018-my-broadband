Intel will cease development of its Vaunt smart glasses, The Information reported. The smart glasses were unveiled earlier this year and aimed to use retinal projection to display information to the wearer. The Vaunt glasses looked similar to traditional spectacles, and did not feature any of the bulky electronics common in smart glasses like the Google Glass. “Intel is continuously working on new technologies and experiences. Not all of these develop into a product we choose to take to market,” said Intel. “We are going to take a disciplined approach as we keep inventing and exploring new technologies, which will sometimes require tough choices when market dynamics don’t support further investment.”
