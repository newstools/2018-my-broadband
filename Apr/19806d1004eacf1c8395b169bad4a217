Apple has made iTunes for Windows available through the Microsoft Store. Microsoft promised at its BUILD conference in May last year it was working with Apple to get iTunes listed in its store before the end of 2017. “Windows users will get the complete iTunes experience, including Apple Music and the iTunes Store,” said Microsoft. However, Apple delayed the release of iTunes for the Microsoft Store in December, AppleInsider reported. The company said it would take a little more time to deliver the full iTunes experience on the platform. iTunes is a free download which weighs in at 476.7MB. Its launch on the Microsoft Store means that Windows 10 S users can now also use the software.
