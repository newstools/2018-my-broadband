Microsoft will start rolling out the latest update to Windows 10 from today. The “Windows 10 April 2018 Update” is aimed at “giving back time” to users, and its main feature is Timeline. Timeline lets users go back in time up to 30 days on their Widows 10 PC. “Because much of our activity is on the go, you can even pick up what you were doing if signed into your Microsoft account while using Microsoft Edge or Office 365 on your iOS or Android device when you return to your Windows 10 PC,” said Microsoft. The update also includes Focus Assist, which stops distractions – like social media notifications or emails – and then provides a summary of what came through to your PC when the assistant is turned off. To check if your Windows 10 PC has received the update, navigate to the Start Menu, and click on the Settings cog. In the Settings menu, click on Windows Update. The Update Status section will show if your system is ready to be upgraded. Users can also turn on automatic updates in the Update Settings section to receive the update as soon as it is available.
