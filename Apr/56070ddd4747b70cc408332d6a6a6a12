The Huawei P20 Lite did not receive much media attention during its international launch, but it has the potential to be a best-seller in South Africa. Its predecessor, the P10 Lite, was one of Huawei’s best-selling devices in South Africa last year, thanks to its attractive pricing and impressive features. Many owners, and those who want a good mid-range smartphone, could therefore be looking to upgrade to the newest device in the Huawei range. Huawei’s P20 Lite retains the modern design of the flagship P20 and P20 Pro, while also carrying over new features from the high-end devices. The new device boasts impressive hardware compared to its predecessor, including a bezel-less display and a dual-lens rear camera. The P20 Lite includes 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM, along with a notched FullView display. The specifications and pricing of the Huawei P10 Lite and P20 Lite are detailed below. Not only is the P20 Lite’s hardware more advanced than the P10 Lite’s, it backs up its improved specifications with a collection of new software features. Fans of Android Oreo will be glad to hear the device ships with Android 8.0 out of the box, adding support for picture-in-picture viewing and much more. The device also brings support for facial recognition security powered by its 16MP front camera, allowing you to unlock your smartphone by simply looking at it. Huawei’s P20 Lite also supports fast charging and now charges over USB-C instead of micro-USB. Dual Bluetooth support allows users to connect their P20 Lite to two devices at once, and the new smartphone finishes off its parade with an adventurous colour range – including a Klein Blue option. While its price is slightly higher than the P10 Lite launch price, the P20 Lite sports an overhauled design along with substantially-improved specifications.
