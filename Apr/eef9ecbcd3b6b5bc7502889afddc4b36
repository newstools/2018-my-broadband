YouTube plans to launch a new version of its Kids app curated by humans instead of algorithms. According to BuzzFeed News, the new Kids app will only display videos picked by a team of human curators. Parents will be able to select the whitelisted-only option from within the application, it added. YouTubeâ€™s current Kids app displays algorithmically-suggested videos, which in some cases have included content not suitable for children. The new whitelist option could reportedly be released within the next few weeks as an update to the existing application. The move comes after YouTube has faced criticism for censoring videos on its platform and cutting off advertising revenue to certain creators.
