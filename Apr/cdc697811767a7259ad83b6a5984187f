MyBroadband has launched a new service to connect consumers with Internet service providers (ISPs) and fibre operators. The new service is linked to MyBroadband’s Speed Test platform, where South Africans can test the performance of their broadband connection. As part of the test, consumers can rate their ISP and say whether they are looking for a new ISP which can better serve their needs. Users looking for a new ISP are given the option to provide their details and be contacted about a new broadband connection or ISP. Users on DSL and wireless connections can also express their interest in fibre-to-the-home and ask to be contacted when fibre is available in their area. This information will only be made available to ISPs which partner with MyBroadband, and they will then be able to contact the consumers interested in their services. Only consumers who proactively ask to be contacted about a new ISP service or fibre access, and submit their contact details, will be put in contact with qualifying providers. To see how fast your Internet connection is, and to rate your ISP, test your broadband speed here now.
