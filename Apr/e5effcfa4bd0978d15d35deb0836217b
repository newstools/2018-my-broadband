The latest report by Cofense shows that South African organisations are not fully prepared to handle phishing threats. Cofense’s South Africa Phishing Response Trends Report looked at the phishing response strategies of 100 South African IT security decision-makers across a variety of industries. The survey found that nearly 90% of respondents have dealt with a security incident originating with a deceptive email, but 56% admit that their phishing response ranges from “totally unprepared” to only “somewhat effective.” Anton Jacobsz, Networks Unlimited Managing Director, discusses the key findings of the Cofense report and how South African businesses can better protect themselves against phishing attacks.
