Facebook is being sued for defamation in the UK by Martin Lewis, whose face he says has been repeatedly used in fake adverts on the platform. Lewis is a consumer advice and money-saving expert who founded the website MoneySavingExpert.com. He said that Facebook has ignored his complaints and requests for action, which has hurt his reputation by causing victims to be lured into various scams. “Other companies such as Outbrain who have run these adverts have taken them down,” said Lewis. “What is particularly pernicious about Facebook is that it says the onus is on me, so I have spent time and effort and stress repeatedly to have them taken down,” he said. Lewis is seeking exemplary damages in the high court for the damage done to his reputation as well as the losses incurred by victims of the various scams.
