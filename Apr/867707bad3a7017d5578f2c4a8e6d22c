Facebook has expanded its test of a downvote button on comments to a subset of users in Australia and New Zealand, CNET reported. The company made it clear that this is not a “dislike” button, but a method to rank comments on posts made by public pages. Facebook started testing the feature with a small percentage of users in the United States earlier this year. “People have told us they would like to see better public discussions on Facebook, and want spaces where people with different opinions can have more constructive dialogue,” said Facebook. “To that end, we’re running a small test in New Zealand which allows people to upvote or downvote comments on public Page posts.” “Our hope is that this feature will make it easier for us to create such spaces, by ranking the comments that readers believe deserve to rank highest, rather than the comments that get the strongest emotional reaction.”
