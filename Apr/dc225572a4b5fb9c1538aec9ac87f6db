Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane was implicated in serious irregularities by Treasury officials and Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu while she was Minister of Water and Sanitation. According to information shared with Parliament, the Department of Water and Sanitation went on a tender deviation spree and wasted billions in project management and professional fees. “Damningly‚ the Department of Water and Sanitation had not consulted the Treasury‚ as is required‚ when it deviated from prescribed tender processes,” the Sunday Times reported. The information further showed that there was leadership instability and a skills crisis at the department under her reign. This is not the first time Mokonyane’s mismanagement at the Department of Water and Sanitation has come under the spotlight. Last year The City Press reported that a construction magnate who offered to pay former president Jacob Zuma’s Nkandla bill is involved in a joint venture which was awarded a R1-billion contract for building an acid mine drainage plant near Springs. The report stated that Zuma’s close ally was paid R81 million in advance for the project, although this is forbidden by the Public Finance Management Act. Other City Press reports exposed how Mokonyane’s young companion has been effectively running her department. It also showed that Phase Two of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project was stalled by Mokonyane in apparent efforts to ensure that people close to her got a slice of the R26-billion deal. In February Mokonyane replaced Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane as communications minister as part of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s cabinet reshuffle.
