MyBroadband has released its Q1 2018 speed test statistics, which show that Stellenbosch is the suburb in South Africa with the highest broadband speed. The statistics used are based on over 1 million speed tests which were performed on MyBroadband’s HTML5 web-based speed test platform between 1 January and 31 March 2018. MyBroadband’s speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure a neutral testing environment. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to the MyBroadband Speed Test platform. The speed tests include fixed-line, wireless, and mobile connections from ISPs, which means the results are representative of multiple technologies.
