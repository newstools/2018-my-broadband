Following Openserve launching 200Mbps fibre wholesale services for local ISPs, the company has provided MyBroadband with more details on the move. Previously, ISPs selling Openserve fibre services offered a maximum of 100Mbps down and 50Mbps up on a line. The new service from Openserve sees ISPs offering 200Mbps down and 100Mbps up. Openserve said all its current fibre to users is able to receive 200Mbps speeds, and clients can upgrade through a relevent ISP. To enable the speed upgrade, Openserve conducted minor infrastructure upgrades. Updates to provisioning systems were also completed, it added. Competing fibre infrastructure players like Vumatel offer fibre lines with speeds of up to 1Gbps to home users. When asked if it will offer lines faster than 200Mbps to homes, Openserve said it consistently reviews its products and will “align our speeds according to market requirements”. The move to 200Mbps fibre comes after Openserve made changes to its fibre broadband portfolio in 2017. This included 2Mbps lines being upgraded to 4Mbps at the same price, and 8Mbps lines being upgraded to 10Mbps.
