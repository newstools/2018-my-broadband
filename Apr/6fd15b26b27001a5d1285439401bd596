Entelect announced that the 2018 Entelect Challenge has officially launched. The event will run from 25 April and the finals will take place at Comic Con Africa on 15 September 2018. Each year the organisation builds the challenge around a popular game theme, and this year’s challenge is based on Tower Defense. Entelect will run a mini playoffs series, a staggered strategy component, and a grand final playoff event. The series of mini-playoffs will allow contestants to pitch their bots against other players throughout the year and stand a chance of winning entrance to the finals. Three mini-playoffs will take place during the year, with the last round determining six of the eight finalists. Prize money for this year’s Entelect Challenge is R200,000, which will be divided across the mini-playoffs series and finals, with the biggest component awarded at the finals at Comic Con Africa. Grand finals prize amounts are listed below: Entelect runs the Challenge every year to bring the software community together and make the world of programming and machine learning more accessible.
