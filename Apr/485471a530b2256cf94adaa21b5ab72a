HyperX has unveiled its Pulsefire Surge gaming mouse, which sports RGB lighting and a cutting-edge Pixart sensor. The Pixart 3389 sensor inside the mouse grants it up to 16,000DPI, and the device’s primary buttons are rated at 50 million clicks thanks to Omron switches. The Pulsefire Surge also sports a DPI button below its scroll wheel, which can be used to toggle sensitivity. A ring around the edge of the mouse offers 360-degree RGB lighting effects and the mouse’s onboard storage allows it to save up to three configuration profiles. HyperX’s Pulsefire Surge is available internationally for $70.
