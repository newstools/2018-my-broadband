Microsoftâ€™s social chatbot in China has made a breakthrough in communication with users. The XiaoIce chatbot has been updated to operate using full duplex communication. This means the AI can listen and talk to users simultaneously, as opposed to the traditional one-way communication offered by chatbots. The new technology allows the chatbot to speed up its responses and engage in more natural conversation, while removing the need for a wake word to respond to the bot. Microsoft said it is working on rolling out the technology to its other chatbot projects around the world.
