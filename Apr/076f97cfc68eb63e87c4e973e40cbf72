Plex has announced that its VR application now runs on Oculus and Gear VR headsets. Plex develops media server software, along with client applications that interface with it. In addition to hosting your collection of videos, photos, and music, the server also supports channels like Plex’s news streaming service. Plex VR was previously exclusive to the Google Daydream platform. “Of course we haven’t forgotten our roots, and we’re always working to improve our Daydream experience, too,” said Plex.
