Telkom’s 500GB for R50 SmartBroadband Wireless LTE promotion is coming to an end. The 500GB of Night Surfer LTE data could be purchased by a user for R50, and was valid for 31 days. The data could be used between midnight and 07:00 every day, and was available as a once-off purchase or on a recurring monthly basis. The deal, which was praised by users, is coming to an end on 5 May 2018. “Telkom can confirm that its promotional prepaid offer of 500GB LTE Night Surfer data for R50, which was launched in July 2017, will be discontinued effective 5 May 2018,” Telkom told MyBroadband. “Telkom is now preparing to take the learnings from this promotional offer into new product innovations that are more compelling and applicable to more consumers.” The confirmation from Telkom follows customers receiving a message stating the promotion was ending. The message stated that users will be able to purchase this bundle up to 4 May 2018. Bundles purchased before this date will be valid until all data has been depleted, stated the message.
