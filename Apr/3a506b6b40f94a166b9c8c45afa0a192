Over R500,000 has been stolen from the Cape Bird Club, following its treasurer’s email account being “hacked”. According to a report by the Sunday Times, the fraud took place while the the club’s treasurer was one leave. A “hacker” changed settings in the treasurer’s email account which allowed for mails to be diverted between her account and SANParks, and the club’s investment management company. The new email settings allowed the perpetrator to request money to be moved into two Nedbank accounts set up fraudulently in the club’s name. The scam was only discovered when an email request for a money transfer for a national park project included new banking details. When the bird club treasurer called the bank listed as hosting the account, FNB, it said the account did not belong to South African National Parks. The report stated that the stolen money had been raised for various projects, which included the rehabilitation of bird hides in national parks. A criminal case has been opened with the police. Nedbank did not respond to requests for comment, stated the Sunday Times. Email being used as an attack vector is on the rise, according to security firms – with big companies like Netflix and their users often targeted.
