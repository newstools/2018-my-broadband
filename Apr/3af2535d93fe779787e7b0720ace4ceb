Dow Jones Media Group has partnered with Brave Software to test blockchain technology usage in digital publishing. Brave is a web browser which aims to change the way publishers earn money by leveraging blockchain technology. The browser’s token is built on the Ethereum blockchain and is used to reward users for looking at advertisements or to pay publishers for an ad-free browsing experience. This partnership will allow Brave to provide access to premium content from Dow Jones Media Group to a limited number of users who download the browser. The content includes access to Barrons or a premium Market Watch newsletter. “We’re thrilled to be partnering with Dow Jones Media Group to provide Brave users with premium content via Brave and the Basic Attention Token,” said Brave CEO Brendan Eich.
