An optical illusion on Reddit has hit the front page thanks to its mind-boggling properties. The illusion, embedded below, is a swirl of colours that if stared at, fade away – until all the colours have disappeared. According to a report by The Verge, versions of the optical illusion have existed since 1804.  The illusion works when the brain stops paying attention to visual scenes that don’t change, stated The Verge. Derek Arnold, a psychology professor at the University of Queensland, said that movement in the environment and of our eyes is enough to keep a scene vivid. With a blurry image and a fixed gaze, however, the colours fade away, he said.
