Ethereum-based decentralised application Golem has launched a live beta on the Ethereum mainnet. Golem is a platform built using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, which allows users to rent out their CPU or GPU compute power and get paid in cryptocurrency. Golem was one of the first crowdfunded blockchain projects to launch within the Ethereum ecosystem and describes itself as “Airbnb for computers”. Following the launch of the beta, users can now interact with the platform and spend or earn cryptocurrency in the form of GNT tokens. To interact with the Golem platform on the Ethereum mainnet, users must run the application with the “-mainnet” flag, as the app defaults to the testnet version.
