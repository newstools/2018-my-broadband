Cambridge Analytica has issued a press statement disputing suggestions that it obtained Facebook user data illegally. “It has become open season for critics to say whatever they like about us based on speculation and hearsay,” said Cambridge Analytica acting CEO Alexander Tayler. “Conjecture and rumour is being portrayed as fact which is damaging and unfair to the company, its employees, and its clients.” Tayler said it would be impossible to address the hundreds of articles that have misrepresented the company, so it focused on facts to address the accusations being made against the company. “We have launched a website, CambridgeFacts.com, which will exhaustively and scrupulously address the falsehoods around our company and its work.”
