The default phone dialler application for Pixel, Nexus, and Android One devices will get a spam filtering feature in the coming weeks, 9to5Google reported. A beta programme to test the new version of the dialler is available now. This is an extension of the app’s existing ability to alert users as to whether it suspects a call of being a “suspected spam caller”. You will not receive a missed call or voicemail notification for spam calls, but voicemails left by suspected spammers will be available for you to listen to.
