Apple has released a red version of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. A portion of proceeds from the device sales will be donated towards funding HIV/AIDS grants. The device is the same as existing variants of the iPhone 8 – barring the colour – and will be priced the same as the iPhone 8. Pre-orders for the device open from 10 April. Apple did not confirm when South Africa will receive the new phone. Apple will also launch a dark red leather folio for the iPhone X for $99 in the US from tomorrow.
