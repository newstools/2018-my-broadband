An internal memo distributed to Virgin Mobile employees suggest that red iPhone 8 models will launch this week. MacRumors reported that the new iPhones will be added to Virgin Mobile’s inventory this week. The report stated that Apple is expected to make a launch announcement via a press release. “The memo notes that there will be pre-orders, so it’s unclear if the new colour would be available immediately or begin shipping later in April,” said MacRumors. Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman, known for his Apple scoops, confirmed the MacRumors report.
