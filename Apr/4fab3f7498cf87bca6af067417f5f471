FNB has unveiled a new design for its branches, with its branch in Rivonia receiving the first update. “The introduction of the new design is based on extensive research among customers, and it’s expected to enhance customer experience,” said FNB. The new branch design integrates self-service and personalised service, and will “heighten customer privacy during consultations”. “Going forward, FNB will adopt this new design across other branches where a need is identified,” it said. The new branch also includes statement printing at Self Service devices, and a more comfortable and confidential teller environment.
