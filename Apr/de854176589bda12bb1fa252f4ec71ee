Google has launched Google Go, an app for Android smartphones that promises a more efficient way to search in data and network-constrained regions. The app’s creation stems from user needs, which Google said were identified in markets like South Africa. Many people in the country are first-time smartphone users after migrating from a feature phone, and are frustrated by small amounts of RAM and storage space. Unstable network connections are also a source of frustration for users across Africa. Google Go aims to address these concerns with its streamlined functionality. It works well on devices with low amounts of storage, with the app taking up less than 5MB. It also consumes little RAM, weighing in with a footprint of 25MB. The app’s major feature is that it is optimised to work well on unstable network connections, and can save users up to 40% on data usage, said Google. In addition to its core features, the app offers a way to discover information online by tapping through trending queries and topics, or by using voice search. It also includes image search, including a way to search for animated GIFs, and lets you switch between languages. A second language from search results may also be selected by users.
