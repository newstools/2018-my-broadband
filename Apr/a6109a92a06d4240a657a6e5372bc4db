HMD Global hopes to launch the Nokia 8110 in South Africa towards the end of May, or in early June. The company’s general manager for Southern Africa, Shaun Durandt, told MyBroadband they have “very real aspirations” for local retail for the device. Unveiled during Mobile World Congress 2018, the Nokia 8110 is set to launch globally in May. The phone will run on the “Nokia Smart Feature Operating System” – system software built on KaiOS. KaiOS is a fork of the Mozilla Firefox OS project, although the Nokia team was quick to emphasise that KaiOS is not Firefox OS. The Nokia 8110 will offer the ability to synchronise your calendar, email, and contacts out of the box, and support the KaiOS app store and it third-party developers. Facebook is already committed to developing an app for KaiOS-based feature phones. In Europe, the Nokia 8110 will have a recommended retail price of €79. Durandt said they can’t announce a firm South African price yet, but aim to bring the Nokia 8110 to market for a recommended retail price of under R1,000. He said they do expect to face criticism on the price, as people may say they can get an entry-level smartphone for cheaper. However, with devices like the Nokia 8110, it’s about creating a new category, he said.
