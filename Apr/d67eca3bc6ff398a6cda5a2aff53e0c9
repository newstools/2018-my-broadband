The FIDO Alliance and World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) have announced a new authentication standard for web browsers called WebAuthn. The open standard is currently supported in the latest version of Firefox and will be adopted by Chrome and Internet Explorer. WebAuthn attempts to move away from password-reliant authentication to methods based on biometrics and other security measures. Users will be able to use compatible devices and biometric information for second-factor authentication or to replace their passwords entirely. FIDO said developers can now start creating apps and services that use this authentication.
