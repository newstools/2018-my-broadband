For the first time this year, the value of Ford has overtaken that of Tesla. At the time of publication, Tesla’s market cap had fallen to $42.65 billion while Ford’s value was slightly higher at $43.15 billion. Tesla’s market value overtook Ford’s in 2017, prior to the rollout of its Model 3 electric vehicle. The carmaker recently recalled over 123,000 Model S vehicles globally, however, due to a problem with a power-steering component. Ford has also experienced its share of recalls, and in South Africa the Kuga vehicle has earned a reputation of catching alight due to faults.
