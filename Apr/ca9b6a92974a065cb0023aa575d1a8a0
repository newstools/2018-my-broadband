Former president Jacob Zuma may have his Nkandla home taken away as part of the corruption case he faces. According to a report in the Sunday Times, the case will expose Zuma’s personal financial records. If Nkandla is found to have been built with the proceeds of crime, it will be confiscated by the state, added the report. “Zuma also faces the risk of his personal finances, including his bond documents, which he has up to now failed to produce, being exposed in the trial,” stated the Sunday Times. Zuma will also have to disclose loans he received from friends, his tax filings, and other funds he received to fund his “lifestyle”. The former president appeared in the High Court in Durban on Friday to face charges of corruption and fraud, with the case postponed to 8 June. The case against Zuma comes after the ANC removed him from his leadership position in the party. He has faced a string of allegations of corruption since his removal, including allegedly taking a cash bribe of R1 million from an abalone dealer to keep a minister in his job.
