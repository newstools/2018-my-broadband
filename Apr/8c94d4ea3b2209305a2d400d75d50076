Facebook has responded to requests from the Information Regulator for concrete figures on the number of users whose data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica. The company has confirmed that the final figures for the number of users affected is less than what it previously reported. User data was obtained through an app called “YourDigitalLife”, a personality test which was developed by Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan. Facebook users who used the app shared information about their Facebook friends in the process, resulting in the data of people being collected. Facebook said 13 people in South Africa downloaded the “YourDigitalLife” app throughout its lifetime on the platform, making up 0.004% of the app’s total worldwide installs. The company also said that 96,121 people in South Africa were affected due to being friends with those who downloaded the application. These figures were outlined in a letter from Facebook to the South African Information Regulator. “As part of our commitment in contacting those potentially impacted by Cambridge Analytica, we recently released the figure of South Africans who had installed the app and those who were potentially impacted,” Facebook said. “The numbers of affected users originally reported for South Africa were different to those than stated in this letter – we have informed the Information Regulator with the accurate current numbers and continue to contact all those affected,” the company said.
