Samsung has started mass producing 16-gigabit LPDDR4X DRAM for vehicles that falls within the 10nm class. This means the process node for the memory is between 10nm and 19nm, said Samsung. According to Samsung, its new memory chips will enable the industry’s fastest automotive DRAM-based LPDDR4X interface, with the highest density. It also offers greater heat tolerance and is Automotive Grade 1-compliant, meaning the DRAM can withstand temperatures from -40°C to 125°C. “Even in environments with extremely-high temperatures of up to 125°C, its data processing speed comes in at 4,266 megabits per second, a 14% increase from the 8Gb LPDDR4 DRAM that is based on 20nm process technology,” said Samsung “The new memory also registers a 30% increase in power efficiency.” Samsung’s new DRAM for automobiles will be commercially available in various capacities.
