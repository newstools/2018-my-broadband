German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the country has to assume that a recent cyber attack on his ministry came from Russia, Reuters reported. Malware was discovered on government computers which may have been planted there a year earlier. News agency dpa reported that the attack was by Russian hacking group APT28, which infiltrated the German Foreign and Defense Ministries. Maas also urged Russia to adopt a more constructive approach to the conflict in Syria and other “problem areas”, such as implementing a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine. “We had an attack on the Foreign Ministry where we have to assume that it stemmed from Russia,” said Maas. “We can’t just wish all that away… and I think it’s not only reasonable but necessary to point out that we do not view those as constructive contributions.”
