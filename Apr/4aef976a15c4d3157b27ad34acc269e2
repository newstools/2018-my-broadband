The World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Human Capital Report 2017 found that 35% of the skills required for jobs today will change by 2020. In fact, the WEF predicts that 65% of children today will go into careers that don’t yet exist. In IT especially, there’s evidence of rapid-fire skill-set shifts – data science was the new ‘it’ job two years ago; today, leading companies can’t get enough digital transformation specialists. While businesses are scrambling to invest in the skills they need to position information technology at the company core, IT talent is also having to evolve to provide the expertise required for end-to-end digital transformation. Add to this the shifting nature of work itself – the gig economy has given rise to slashers (multi-job jugglers) and giggers (on-demand workers) – and there’s unprecedented opportunity for IT professionals. From back-office support to leaders of change, how does today’s top talent accrue the skills to collaboratively drive maximum business benefits through tech-led innovation? While job titles may be uncertain, one skill will remain pivotal: continuous learning.
