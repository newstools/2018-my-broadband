Solid state drives offer a major performance boost compared to mechanical hard drives, but some SSDs are faster than others. It is important to note that there are multiple types of SSDs, and their performance is dictated by their specifications and interface. If you are focused on the fastest data read and write speeds, you would opt for an M.2 or PCIe NVMe SSD over a 2.5-inch SATA drive. The SATA port with a SATA III interface has a maximum transfer speed of 600MB/s, while PCIe and M.2 form factors can handle higher bandwidth transfers when paired with a faster interface like NVMe. For this reason, the fastest SSDs on the market usually come in the M.2 or PCIe form factors, and enthusiasts should check if their desktop or laptop has a compatible port for these drives. SSD specifications such as writes-per-second and NAND type are often considered when comparing high-performance drives. Benchmarks provide real-world data regarding the relative performance of each drive, however, are are a good way to measure the “best” drives. Using data from PassMark, we have compared the benchmark scores of the fastest solid state drives on the local market. The data used in the comparison is collected by PassMark’s PerformanceTest software, which offers a suite of benchmark tools – including 3D graphics, CPU, and memory tests. Intel’s 900P Optane drives rank at the top thanks to their 3D Xpoint-based architecture, with Samsung’s V-NAND SSDs following closely behind at more attractive price points. A list of the top 10 SSDs you can buy in South Africa, according to the rankings, is below. Only SSDs which are readily available in South Africa were included in the comparison.
