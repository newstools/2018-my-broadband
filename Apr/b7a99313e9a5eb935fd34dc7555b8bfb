The CIPC and ZADNA have formally launched the CIPC .ZA Domain Registration Platform. ZADNA and the CIPC partnered to develop the system, which integrates company registration and domain name registration. “This partnership makes it easier and more convenient for users of the CIPC platform to use the CIPC platform to register .za domain names that match their company names,” said ZADNA. Companies can register their domain names before, during, or after the company registration process – via the CIPC’s website. The organisation noted that the CIPC does not offer hosting, however, only domain name registration. “Domains registered through the CIPC will have to be transferred to an accredited registrar,” it said. The online system was put in place in December 2017, and is the result of a partnership between the CIPC, ZADNA, and ZACR. According to ZADNA, the CIPC .za domain name registration fee is R51.30.
