Following an update to Steam’s profile privacy settings, SteamSpy announced it will no longer be able to operate. Game developer Sergey Galyonkin runs the SteamSpy website, which collects and processes data from Steam to deliver estimates of game sales and ownership. SteamSpy said it relies on the information Valve has now made private by default and would be unable to continue providing data on the platform. Steam’s new profile changes have made every user’s game library hidden by default, although player names and other information is still visible. Other changes to profile privacy on Steam include the ability to keep total playtime private and an “invisible mode” which lets you appear offline but still interact with your friends list.
