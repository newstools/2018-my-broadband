Chat app Discord has partnered with Microsoft to link Xbox Live profiles in the application. The app already supports Steam, Facebook, and Twitter profile connections, and will now allow gamers to link their Xbox account to their Discord profile. Xbox One users can now link their profile to their Discord account from within the Account Settings menu on their console. PC gamers will be able to link their Xbox account to their Discord profile from the Discord app. After linking their accounts, gamers can choose to show their friends what Xbox Live games they are currently playing.
