Facebook has launched a Data Abuse Bounty to reward people who report any misuse of data by app developers. The Data Abuse Bounty will help Facebook to identify violations of its policies. It will reward people with first-hand knowledge and proof of cases where a Facebook platform app collects and transfers people’s data to another party to be sold, stolen, or used for scams or political influence. “Just like the bug bounty programme, we will reward based on the impact of each report,” said Facebook. While there is no maximum value, high-impact bug reports have earned as much as $40,000 for people who bring them to Facebook’s attention. Facebook said it will review all legitimate reports and respond as quickly as possible when a credible threat is identified. “If we confirm data abuse, we will shut down the offending app and take legal action against the company.”
