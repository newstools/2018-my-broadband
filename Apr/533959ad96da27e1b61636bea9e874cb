Whether you are building a gaming and streaming PC or a professional workstation, Intel and AMD’s top-of-the-range processors will meet all the tasks thrown at them. Unlike standard processors, Intel and AMD’s Core X and Ryzen lineups offer a much higher number of CPU cores in addition to impressive clock speeds with overclocking support. These chips are reserved for the most powerful desktop PCs, and considerably more expensive than standard consumer processors. To see what the best-of-the-best costs, we compared the performance and South African pricing of the most powerful desktop chips on the market. Benchmarks for this comparison were taken from AnandTech’s benchmark database, which uses data extracted from real-world tests. We compared the CineBench Multi-Threaded, CineBench Single-Threaded, and 7-Zip encoding scores of the top-performing processors – ranking them according to their multi-threaded performance. These high-end desktop processors are aimed at consumers who require exceptional multi-threaded performance. High single-threaded performance is better delivered by cheaper mainstream processors. The benchmark data for the 10 most powerful desktop processors available in South Africa is below. While the chips deliver impressive performance, they come with big price tags. The exception to this rule are AMD’s Ryzen 7 1800X and 1700X processors, however, which offer great multi-threaded performance at a relatively-accessible price point. It should be noted that older high-end processors tend to retain their high prices despite being outperformed by newer, cheaper counterparts. For this reason, it is usually best to purchase a processor from the latest generation available. The pricing for each of the top 10 processors listed in the benchmark table is detailed below. Pricing was sourced from Rebel Tech to avoid price differences between retailers.
