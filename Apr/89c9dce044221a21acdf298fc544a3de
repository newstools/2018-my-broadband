Samsung Pay will launch in South Africa around June 2018, the CEO of Samsung Electronics Africa, Sung Yoon, has announced. Speaking on the Expresso Show, Yoon said Samsung Pay will be available this winter, but then firmed up his statement to “around June”. “That means, if you use the Samsung Galaxy S9, you can just tap on the [point of sale] machine. You don’t need to swipe or insert your card,” said Yoon. He said you will not have to bring your credit card on shopping trips anymore, and therefore won’t have to worry about losing it. “If you lose a credit card, somebody can still use it,” said Yoon. On the Galaxy S9, you have the option to secure your details and authorise payments with three different biometric technologies: iris scan, fingerprint, and facial recognition. A PIN is also supported. This is not the first time Samsung has announced a launch window for its tap-and-go payment system in South Africa. In 2017, it stated that Samsung Pay was in testing and was planned for launch in South Africa before the end of that year. When it launches in South Africa, it will go up against QR-code based mobile payment services like Zapper and SnapScan, as well as the tap cards being rolled out by major banks. Yoon did not reveal on which other devices Samsung Pay will be supported in South Africa, or where the system will be offered. Samsung South Africa said it is currently working with various financial institutions on partnerships.
