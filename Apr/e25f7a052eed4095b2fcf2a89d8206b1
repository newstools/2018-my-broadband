Instagram has officially launched its new data download tool, rolling it out to Android and iOS. The photo-sharing platform recently announced it was building a data portability tool which allowed users to transport their data. The tool can be accessed through any web browser on the Instagram website, and the app on mobile devices. After downloading their data, users will receive their profile information, archived stories, videos, photos, uploaded contacts, as well as usernames of followers and those they follow. Instagram has launched the tool to comply with new privacy laws launched in the European Union.
