Airbus has partnered with Zodiac Aerospace to develop new passenger modules with sleeping berths. The modules will allow airlines to offer additional space to customers, including onboard lounges, conference rooms, and luxury bedrooms. The company said the modules are designed to fit in an aircraft’s cargo compartment and would be easily interchangeable. “This approach to commercial air travel is a step change towards passenger comfort. We have already received very positive feedback from several airlines on our first mock-ups,” said Airbus. “We are pleased to partner with Zodiac Aerospace on this project which will introduce a new passenger experience and add value for airlines.” Airbus has released concept art outlining possible uses for its new modules, shown below.
