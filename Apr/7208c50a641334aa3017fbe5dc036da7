Chrome Web Store will no longer accept extensions that mine cryptocurrency, due to the rise in malicious extensions. Chrome said there has been a rise in malicious extensions that appear to provide useful functionality, but embed hidden cryptocurrency mining scripts. These scripts run in the background without the user’s consent and consume significant CPU resources. Chrome Web Store previously permitted cryptocurrency mining in extensions, as long as this was the extension’s only defined purpose. “Unfortunately, approximately 90% of all extensions with mining scripts have failed to comply with these policies,” said Google. Existing extensions that mine cryptocurrency will be delisted from the Chrome Web Store in June, it added. Extensions with blockchain-related purposes other than mining will continue to be permitted in the store.
