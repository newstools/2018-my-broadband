Deezer has unveiled its new Flow tab – a place users will see personalised playlists based on what they listen to. Playlists based on a genre which Deezer thinks a user will enjoy remembering or discovering will also be shown. “You can click on any of the Inspired by cards to take a look on what’s there or just press play and be surprised,” said the company. “You can favourite any of the songs you’ve loved, add all of them to an existing playlist, or create a whole playlist with everything to save it for later.” The traditional Flow service is also still working, just “press play and enjoy an endless mix of your favourites and recommendations”.
