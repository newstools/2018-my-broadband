Facebook has announced changes to the way it stores user data, and how apps access data on its platform. It expects to make more changes in the coming months, and promised to provide updates as they rolled out. In a post on its website, the company provided a summary of what it said were the most important changes being implemented. This included call and text history, which is part of an opt-in feature for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. It allows the app to surface the contacts you most frequently communicate with. “We’ve reviewed this feature to confirm that Facebook does not collect the content of messages – and will delete all logs older than one year,” said Facebook. “In the future, the client will only upload to our servers the information needed to offer this feature – not broader data such as the time of calls.” Facebook will also approve all apps that request access to information, such as check-ins, likes, photos, posts, videos, events, and groups. “We started approving these permissions in 2014, but now we’re tightening our review process – requiring these apps to agree to strict requirements before they can access this data.”
