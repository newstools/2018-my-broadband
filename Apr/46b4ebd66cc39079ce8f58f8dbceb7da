YouTube has released its first Community Guidelines Enforcement Report, which it has promised to publish quarterly. The first report covers Q4 2017, and reveals that 8.3 million videos were removed from YouTube in the period. Of the videos removed, 6.7 million were automatically flagged and 76% removed before they received any views. “Automated flagging enables us to act more quickly and accurately to enforce our policies,” said Google. The majority of the videos removed due to user flagging were from YouTube’s Individual Trusted Flagger programme, with the platform taking down 1.1 million videos reported by Trusted Flaggers. Trusted Flaggers include individuals, NGOs, and government agencies. YouTube received 9.3 million flags on videos during the quarter, of which 94.9% came from users. Most of the videos flagged were either due to sexual content or because they were spam. Of the videos flagged by users, 1.6% were due to the video promoting terrorism.
