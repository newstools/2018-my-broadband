ASUS has launched its Lyra Trio mesh Wi-Fi solution, following its recent unveiling. The three-hub system features dual-band connectivity and can cover a multi-storey home up to 500 square metres in size, said ASUS. The system also features AiProtection, 3×3 MIMO technology, parental controls, and support for the ASUS Lyra app. “ASUS Lyra Trio delivers AC1750 Wi-Fi speeds to every corner of the home, so users can enjoy a smooth and seamless connection with sufficient bandwidth for video streaming and gaming,” said the company. This is thank to the antennas on the Lyra Trio, which have a “unique pyramid configuration to transmit the Wi-Fi signal vertically as well as horizontally”, it added. “This design also positions the antennas above the circuit board and angles them at 45 degrees to ensure minimal interference for the best possible Wi-Fi signal.”
