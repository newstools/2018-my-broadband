Intel has announced new features for its Threat Detection Technology in an effort to reassure the industry in the wake of the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities. Ars Technica reported that one of the new features is Advanced Memory Scanning, which will scan system memory to detect malware that avoids writing anything to disk. This can consume CPU resources, so Intel opted to offload the task to the graphics processor – which is typically lightly loaded in desktop applications. The GPU will scan through memory for malware signatures, which Intel said will cut the processor load to about 2%. Advanced Memory Scanning will be available for third-party use, and Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection will add Intel’s GPU memory scanning technology next month.
