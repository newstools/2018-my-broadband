Cool Ideas is making waves in the South African market, and under the leadership of cofounders Paul Butschi and Andre Jooste has shown excellent growth. The company recently moved into its new offices in Rosebank and is aggressively growing its subscriber base. Being in charge of a multi-million-rand business is a long way from where Butschi started – as an employee at an Internet cafe in Sandton. He could not recall the pay at his first job, but said it “was per hour and not much”. Butschi started to work at Dial a Nerd as an onsite support technician at the same time, which strengthened his understanding of the consumer IT market. Butschi said he and Jooste had the idea of starting a hosting company, which highlighted the problem of connectivity for their customers. “We started offering FTTB via DFA, then when Vumatel came to Parkhurst where I live we saw it as an opportunity to get into the FTTH space,” he said. He said the success of Cool Ideas is a combination of a good opportunity and years of hard work. Butschi said the rapid growth of Cool Ideas comes with long hours and lots of stress, but it is worth it to watch their idea grow into something of substance. MyBroadband also asked Butschi about his business and technology choices.  Which smartphone do you use? Samsung Galaxy S8+. Which laptop do you use? Dell Inspiron 14-inch.
