Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has resisted efforts by US senators to commit the company to congressional regulations, Reuters reported. When asked what regulations he thought were necessary, Zuckerberg said he will have his team follow up with the US Senate’s Commerce and Judiciary committees. “That way we can have this discussion across the different categories where I think this discussion needs to happen,” said Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg was questioned for nearly five hours by 44 US senators, each of whom had five minutes to grill him. He repeated apologies made for a range of problems at Facebook, including a lack of data protection and Russian agents using Facebook to influence the US elections.
