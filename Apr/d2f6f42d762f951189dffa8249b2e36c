Snapchat will test un-skippable video advertisements from May, Digiday reported. The new ad format, which Snap refers to as Commercials, will be six-second video and run in specific Snapchat Shows. Commercials will not run in Snapchat’s magazine-style Discover editions or users’ personal stories, said Snap. News of the new ad format follows a report on AdAge stating that Snap was considering forcing users to sit through three seconds of an ad before allowing them to skip. Snapchat currently shows skippable ads throughout in-app content, and a study found that at least 69% of users almost always skip them. Advertisers have also complained that most ads don’t make it to the one second mark before being skipped.
