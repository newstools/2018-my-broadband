Vodacom and Please Call Me “inventor” Nkosana Makate are no closer to reaching a payment agreement, according to the Sunday Times. Negotiations between Vodacom and Makate have been taking place for years, following his victory in the constitutional court. Makate previously stated that Vodacom must pay him 15c of every rand of revenue that the Please Call Me has generated. This could equate to over R10 billion, according to estimates. The negotiations with Vodacom have been hampered by multiple factors, however, including infighting between Makate, his legal team, and his financial backers. The latest report from the Sunday Times stated that talks between Vodacom and Makate are still taking place, but the parties are not any closer to reaching an agreement. Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub will now reportedly be involved in resolving the matter. Vodacom said discussions between the parties are ongoing, while Makate confirmed there was a deadlock in their discussions.
