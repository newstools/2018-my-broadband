Telegram has been banned in Russia, and the country’s telecommunications regulator Roskomnadzor recently blocked Internet Protocol addresses belonging to Amazon and Google in an effort to enforce the ban. Speaking to TechCrunch, Google confirmed that certain services are being affected in Russia as a result. “We are aware of reports that some users in Russia are unable to access some Google products, and are investigating those reports,” said Google. Google services affected in the region include Search, Gmail, and push notifications for Android. Despite Russia’s attempts to block Telegram, many people in the country continue to use the messaging service.
