MacOS will start showing alerts when you run a 32-bit app on version 10.13.4 or later of the operating system, AppleInsider reported. “[App] is not optimised for your Mac,” states the alert message. “This app needs to be updated by its developer to improve compatibility.” The message is intended to warn users that Apple will soon end support for the legacy technology. Clicking the “Learn More” button on the alert takes users to a support document explaining Apple’s process of moving away from 32-bit. Apple notes that 64-bit apps are able to access more memory and use newer technologies, like its Metal graphics acceleration. MacOS High Sierra, the latest version of Apple’s PC operating system, will be the last version to run 32-bit apps “without compromise”, said Apple.
