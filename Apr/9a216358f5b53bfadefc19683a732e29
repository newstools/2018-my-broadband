Cell C’s Black streaming service is set to expand its content offering with hundreds of new titles this year. Speaking at the launch of Black’s new offices at the Cell C campus in Johannesburg, Black chief executive Surie Ramasary said the streaming service will offer many new TV shows and movies in 2018. “We have an amazing catalogue of content coming next quarter,” said Ramasary. Black will also expand content offerings for its other products, which include music streaming and social features. Ramasary announced that Lionsgate content will be available on Black next quarter, bringing hundreds of films to the platform. She added that the platform was pushing for consumer awareness through various promotions. “We can see how we are changing access to content in the market. We are putting investment into educating the consumer market about Black.” To further consumer awareness, Black will launch a major promotion towards the end of April which aims to onboard new customers. Ramasary noted that airtime has become the predominant billing method across Black, signifying a large amount of mobile users consuming content across the platform. Black has completed work on its new offices, which are based in Cell C’s main campus in Johannesburg. Although the Black offices are located within Cell C, they feature their own unique style, comprising an orange and purple colour scheme and images of popular content on the platform.
