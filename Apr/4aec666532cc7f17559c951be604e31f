Netflix has released its Q1 2018 financial results, which show the company made $3.6 billion in streaming revenue from its 125 million subscribers. “Our job is to spend this money wisely to increase our members’ delight,” said Netflix. Netflix’s revenue grew 43% year-over-year in Q1, the fastest pace in the history of its streaming business. This growth was thanks to a 25% increase in average paid streaming memberships and a 14% rise in the average selling price. In the quarter, Netflix added 7.41 million subscribers, up 50% year-over-year and ahead of its 6.35 million forecast.
