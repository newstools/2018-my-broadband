Openserve recently launched 200Mbps fibre wholesale services to ISPs. Subsequently, ISPs have started offering 200Mbps fibre packages to customers on Openserveâ€™s infrastructure. Previously, the maximum speed on Openserve fibre was limited to 100Mbps down and 50Mbps up. Following the new offering, maximum speeds on Openserve fibre can now reach up to 200Mbps down and 100Mbps up. Many ISPs do not yet offer the new 200Mbps Openserve fibre packages, however. Local ISPs who are offering 200Mbps Openserve packages include MWEB, Axxess, Cool Ideas, and Webafrica. Webafrica does not offer any uncapped fibre packages for 200Mbps lines, however, while Cool Ideas does not offer any capped fibre packages. The best 200Mbps capped and unpacked fibre packages currently available in South Africa are listed below.
