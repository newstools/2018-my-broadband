Toyota and Lexus are developing technology which will enable vehicles to talk to each other and the surrounding environment. The automakers plan to start deployment of the Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) systems on vehicles sold in the United States in 2021. DSRC transmissions enable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications – collectively known as V2X. Communication can be enabled to provide helpful real-time information to drivers, such as potential hazards, slow or stopped vehicles, or signals, signs, and road conditions. DSRC communicates using seven channels of 5.9GHz spectrum, allocated for Intelligent Transportation Systems. As the technology does not require a cellular or data network, vehicles do not incur any cellular network charges. DSRC is also based on industry standards, so Toyota vehicles will communicate with other automakers’ vehicles, multiplying the safety benefits for all. These communication technologies can be coupled with sensor technology to make automated vehicle systems safer and more reliable.
