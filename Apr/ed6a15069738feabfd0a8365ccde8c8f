Cool Ideas cofounder Andre Jooste said he loves his job, and how as a small company they can compete with big corporates – based on the decisions their leadership team makes. Jooste and other cofounder Paul Butschi started Cool Ideas in 2011 when they saw an opportunity to get into the hosting space. “With the demand growing for better connectivity, we explored the business offerings on the DFA network,” he said. Vumatel then started rolling out a fibre-to-the-home network in Johannesburg, and this is when Cool Ideas entered the consumer ISP market. The company has shown stellar growth since its launch, and has become a firm favourite among many South Africans. Jooste said the success of Cool Ideas is thanks to long hours of work and learning how a business functions in his previous jobs. “Where we built our first fibre ring really helped when Vumatel came along as we were already known in the community,” he said. This lucky break helped Cool Ideas expand its business, especially in the fibre-to-the-home market. For those looking to enter the telecoms market as entrepreneurs, Jooste said hard work is key. “Nothing comes from being lazy.” “The ISP market has so much opportunity still left and with a great idea and hard work you can only be successful,” he said.
