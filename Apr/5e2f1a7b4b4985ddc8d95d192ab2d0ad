Apple has no plans to combine MacOS and iOS, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Cook stated that a merger of the two operating systems – one for PCs, and the latter for smartphones and iPads – would require diluting one of the systems, reported Engadget. “We don’t believe in sort of watering down one for the other,” said Cook. “One of the reasons that both of them are incredible is because we pushed them to do what they do well.” If you begin to merge the two, you make trade-offs and compromises, he said. The statement from Cook follows a Bloomberg report from 2017 which stated that iOS and MacOS were being tested in a unification project.
