It is used by millions of users to host and promote their photos and videos, and embed them in blogs and social media posts. Flickr offers mobile users apps for iOS and Android, and an optimised mobile website. SmugMug is a paid photo-sharing website and image hosting service which allows users to upload HD photos and videos. The platform was launched in 2002, and apart from hosting services it offers subscribers the ability to sell digital and print media. SmugMug buying Flickr will see these technologies combined.
