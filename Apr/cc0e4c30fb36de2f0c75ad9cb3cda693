Spotify announced it will use machine learning to augment its free-tier service, TechCrunch reported. Where users on Spotify’s free tier have always been limited to shuffle-only play, the service will be modified to allow users to listen to any song that the platform’s engine recommends. The music streaming service will learn your tastes and create 15 personalised “Discovery” playlists. This totals around 750 tracks, or over 40 hours of music, for free on-demand streaming. It will use existing user-made playlists, including the songs in those playlists and the name of the playlists themselves, to create recommendations. You will then be able to listen to any track in your discovery playlists as many times as you want.
