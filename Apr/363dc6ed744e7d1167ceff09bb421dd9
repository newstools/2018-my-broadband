MTN Group recently released its integrated report for the year ended 31 December 2017. The report is used to inform stakeholders about its operations, and the opportunities and challenges it faces. These are varied, thanks to MTN’s footprint in markets across Africa and the Middle East, and include the challenges faced when operating in a war zone. The company also detailed its “outcomes for 2017”, revealing statistics on how many employees it has, how much it spent on salaries and tax, and what it has improved on in the past year. MTN listed several standout figures as highlights for 2017. This included the fact that it created 18,931 “employment opportunities”. This consisted of 15,901 employees and 3,030 contractors, and covered 63 nationalities, said MTN. MTN paid these employees R9 billion in wages and salaries. In terms of its infrastructure, MTN said it spent R31.5 billion on capital expenditure – which contributed to it rolling out: The company also paid R27.9 billion in total tax contributions, R367 million in regulatory fees, and spent R172 million on social investment. MTN said its operating environments have “direct implications for our ability to create value”, and each market features its own challenges and opportunities. The company said prolonged war in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and South Sudan obviously impacts its operations. Elections planned for 2019 in South Africa and Nigeria are additional important events to take into account, along with the threat of sanctions from the US in Iran. “Across our footprint, government interventions are increasing and the regulatory environment is complex, but governments are focused on increasing connectivity and digitising societies,” said MTN. It added that Africa – where MTN operates in multiple countries – is forecast to be the world’s second-fastest growth region to 2020. This is impacted on by currency volatility in countries like South Africa, however, and inflationary pressure in Nigeria.
