Cellphone bill comparison site Tariffic is closing, CEO Antony Seeff has stated. Seeff has sent an email to industry stakeholders stating that it is “with sadness that today we close the doors of Tariffic”. “I feel happy to have had the opportunities we did. I feel devastated that we couldn’t make it work,” he said. “We’ve tried so many different pivots and tactics, and learnt a fortune of lessons along the way.” “As this door closes, so others do open and I look forward to some new adventures ahead,” he concluded. Tariffic was well-known in the telecoms industry, and its studies were often referenced by MyBroadband for articles like Vodacom has the worst deals for smartphones, MTN has the best. The company offered personal and corporate cellphone bill comparison services in South Africa, and partnered with Hippo to launch a cellphone package comparison service in 2016.
