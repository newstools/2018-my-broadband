PayPal is rolling out the ability for consumers to use PayPal within Samsung Pay, and make purchases at retailers which accept Samsung Pay. Samsung Pay users can load their PayPal account with the debit card or bank account in their PayPal Wallet. “It’s convenient for consumers, because Samsung Pay works with both NFC and MST – that is, it works almost anywhere you can swipe or tap a card,” said PayPal. Consumers who use PayPal in Samsung Pay will continue to earn Samsung Rewards points on their purchase. Security is also strong, and when consumers use their phone to pay, PayPal doesn’t send their actual payment information to merchants. Instead, PayPal uses a virtual account number leveraging tokenization to represent their account info. Samsung Pay also offers biometric authentication, tokenization of payment credentials, and Samsung’s Knox platform for increased security.
