ICASA has published a discussion document on Digital Sound Broadcasting Services in South Africa. The authority said the document is part of a process to implement a digital sound broadcasting service in the country. It said digital broadcasting differs from traditional analogue broadcasting services, as “digital signals can be transmitted successfully at lower transmitter power”. “Digital radio is also easy to use or tune in than analogue radio.” “The licensing of different forms of broadcasting services require a lot of spectrum, which is a scarce resource and ICASA continues to receive enquiries from the public about licensing processes,” it added. ICASA said it has already granted several trial licences for digital sound broadcasting in South Africa, with the first going to the SABC in November 2013. This was to test the DAB+ technology. “The public broadcaster is using two transmitters, one in Johannesburg and another in Pretoria. Both transmitters use a single frequency of 239.2 MHz in an SFN configuration, covering the majority of the Gauteng province,” said ICASA. Interested parties are invited to make written representations on the discussion document to ICASA.
