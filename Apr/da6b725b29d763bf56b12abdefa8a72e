Apple has hired former Google head of search on AI John Giannandrea to work on the company’s machine learning and AI strategy, the New York Times reported. Giannandrea stepped down from his position at Google yesterday and was reportedly planning to stay on at Google in a different role. In his new position at Apple, Giannandrea will become one of 16 executives who report directly to CEO Tim Cook. “Our technology must be infused with the values we all hold dear,” Cook told staff. “John shares our commitment to privacy and our thoughtful approach as we make computers even smarter and more personal.”
