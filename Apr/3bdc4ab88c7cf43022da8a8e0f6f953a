Samsung has launched the Samsung 970 PRO and 970 EVO, the third generation of its consumer SSD lineup. The drives are based on the M.2 form factor and use the latest PCIe Gen 3×4 lane interface. This allows for high-end performance, which includes: The write speeds are up to 30% faster than the previous generation of drives, thanks to Samsung’s latest V-NAND technology and the new Phoenix controller. The 970 PRO and EVO also offer a five-year warranty, or up to 1,200TB written. Samsung said the SSDs further offer Dynamic Thermal Guard technology, which protects against overheating by automatically monitoring and maintaining optimal operating temperatures. The 970 EVO will be offered in 250GB, 500GB, 1TB and 2TB capacities, while the 970 PRO comes in 512GB and 1TB capacities. Pricing for the drives start at $329 for the 970 PRO, and $119 for the 970 EVO.
