Tinder has started testing a new video-based feature called Tinder Loops. Loops are two-second looping videos which can be saved as profile pictures or added to your profile. Users can upload existing videos and edit them to create Loops in the Tinder app, changing the playback speed and selecting which segment to save. Tinder has started testing the Loops feature on iOS devices in Canada and Sweden. The matchmaking app is also testing the ability to add nine photos or Loops to your Tinder profile instead of the current six.
