Researchers at F-Secure have found a vulnerability in the electronic lock system used by global hotel chains which can give a hacker access to any room. The vulnerability is linked to the lock system’s software, which is known as Vision by VingCard. “These security oversights were not obvious holes. It took a thorough understanding of the whole system’s design to identify small flaws that, when combined, produced the attack,” said F-Secure. F-Secure notified the world’s largest lock manufacturer Assa Abloy about its discovery, and worked with the company to implement software fixes. Assa Abloy has now issued software updates with security fixes to mitigate the issue.  The attack makes use of an old electronic key card which was used at the hotel – even one that’s long expired or has been discarded. Information from the old key card is used to create a master key which can be used to open any room in a hotel. According to F-Secure, the attack can be performed without being noticed.
