Cloudflare has announced its own public Domain Name System resolver at the IP addresses 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1. The company said DNS has a censorship problem, which resolver services such as Google’s at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 help work around when governments block sites. “Google’s DNS resolver is great, but diversity is good and we thought we could do even better,” said Cloudflare. DNS also has a privacy problem, it warned. “What many Internet users don’t realise is that even if you’re visiting a website that is encrypted, that doesn’t keep your DNS resolver from knowing the identity of all the sites you visit,” said Cloudflare. “That means, by default, your ISP, every Wi-Fi network you’ve connected to, and your mobile network provider have a list of every site you’ve visited while using them.” After asking browser manufacturers what they want from a DNS resolver, Cloudflare designed a system that does not store any querying IP addresses on a hard drive and wipes all logs within 24 hours. Cloudflare also announced that the resolver supports modern standards like DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS. “We’re hoping that with an independent DNS-over-HTTPS service now available, we’ll see more experiments from browsers, operating systems, routers, and apps to support the protocol.”
