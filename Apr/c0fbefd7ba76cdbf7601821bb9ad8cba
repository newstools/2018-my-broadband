Westworld creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy have posted a 25-minute video on YouTube claiming to be a primer for the second season of Westworld. Nolan was answering questions on Reddit in an ask me anything thread, and stated that the fan theories discussed in the Westworld subreddit create a problem for them due to way they are reported online. “Theories can actually be spoilers, and the line between the two is confusing,” said Nolan. He then proposed a video that lays out the plot of season 2, including all its twists. “That way the members of the community here who want the season spoiled for them can watch ahead, and then protect the rest of the community.” “It’s a new age, and a new world in terms of the relationship between the folks making shows and the community watching them,” he added. His proposed video post received 2,400 upvotes, and Nolan released a link to the video in a follow-up comment.
