The African Coast to Europe (ACE) undersea cable recently suffered a break, resulting in a connectivity outage for several west-African countries, The Verge reported. Reports suggest the break happened off the coast of Mauritania, knocking the country offline for 48 hours. Although Mauritania was worst hit, at least 10 neighbouring countries were also affected. The other affected nations appeared to have sufficient redundancy in place to mitigate the effects of the ACE cable outage. Despite the redundancies, there were stillÂ significant disruptions to Internet access in those countries for days after the break.
