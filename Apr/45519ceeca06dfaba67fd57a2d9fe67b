ADSL subscriptions increased in South Africa in 2017, according to ICASA’s latest State of the ICT Sector report. ICASA is responsible for the collection of statistics to monitor and report on the progress of ICT in the country, and used this information for the report. The report stated that fibre and DSL broadband subscriptions increased in the country last year, although fibre grew at a much faster rate. “The total number of fixed line subscriptions increased by 3.7%,” said ICASA. “The analogue fixed-telephone lines and fixed public payphone increased by 30.0% and 216.1% respectively in 2017.” Fixed wireless local loop subscriptions and ISDN voice-channel equivalent “significantly decreased”, however. The total number of overall fixed line subscriptions also decreased by 2.6%, when looking at the past three years.  Fixed broadband subscriptions increased by 59.9% in 2017, with DSL Internet subscriptions increasing by 36.7%, said ICASA. “Fibre-to-the-home/building Internet subscriptions and other fixed broadband subscriptions saw a substantial increase of 523.9% and 379.2% in 2017.” For the three-year period from 2015 to 2017, fixed broadband subscriptions increased by 65.1%. Over the same period, DSL Internet subscriptions increased by 55.0%.  Fixed line traffic was an area which did not enjoy growth, said ICASA.
