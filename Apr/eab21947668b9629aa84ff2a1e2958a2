Limelight Networks, a digital content delivery company, has opened a new point-of-presence (PoP) in South Africa. The PoP is hosted in Teraco’s data centre, alongside the NAPAfrica Johannesburg IXP. The move will see Limelight Networks create new industry partnerships in the region, said the company. “Limelight’s expansion into Africa follows positive signs of online traffic growth. According to reports, the global mobile Content Delivery Network market is predicted to reach $70.3 billion by 2025,” said Teraco. Lex Van Wyk, Teraco CEO, said CDNs host a large portion of global Internet traffic and it is predicted that in five years, CDN traffic will exceed 70% of total online traffic. “Movies, music, and sports are the foundation of digital content for most countries, and South Africa is no different,” said Simon Beech, Head of EMEA Partnerships at Limelight Networks. “As connectivity improves, it is essential to provide the highest quality online experiences to stay competitive,” he added.
