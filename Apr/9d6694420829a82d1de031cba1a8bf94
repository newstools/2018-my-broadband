The GSMA has put the development of its eSIM standard on hold, pending the completion of an investigation by the US Department of Justice. The GSMA represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, andÂ is currently working with mobile operators, device makers, and SIM manufacturers to facilitate the development of a universal standard for eSIM. eSIMs let users switch between operators without needing to swap physical SIM cards. The standard contains a wide range of features, including the option for the eSIM to be locked. In the US, users would need to explicitly consent to this under commercial agreements with their mobile operator. For example, when purchasing a subsidised device. The GSMA has now put development of the latest version of the eSIM on hold until the Department of Justice investigation into possible collusion between AT&T, Verizon, and the GSMA to stifle the card-free technology is completed. The GSMA said it is cooperating fully in this matter.
