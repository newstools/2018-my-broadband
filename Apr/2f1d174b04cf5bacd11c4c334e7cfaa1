The European Commission has opened an investigation into Apple’s proposed acquisition of Shazam. The Commission said it is concerned that the merger could reduce the options for users of music streaming services within the EU. Both Spotify and Apply get one million clicks per day through Shazam, and Apple may direct traffic only to its streaming services. Apple might also be able to access sensitive data on its competition following the acquisition, said the Commission. “At this stage, the Commission is concerned that, following the takeover of Shazam, Apple would obtain access to commercially-sensitive data about customers of its competitors,” it said. “Access to such data could allow Apple to directly target its competitors’ customers and encourage them to switch to Apple Music.” The investigation will run until 4 September 2018 the latest.
