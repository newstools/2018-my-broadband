MultiChoice has launched three new apps for DStv Now – supporting Samsung smart TVs, Apple TV, and Android TV media players. MultiChoice stated that certain Samsung smart TV models from 2015 onwards would be supported, along with Apple TV 4th-gen and up, and Google-certified media players running Android. Apps are also set to be added for additional brands of smart TVs, said the company, with LG and Hisense apps currently being worked on. “These apps make it possible for DStv subscribers to turn any TV in their house into an easy-to-use DStv hub,” said MultiChoice. The Samsung smart TV models which support the DStv Now app are listed below.
