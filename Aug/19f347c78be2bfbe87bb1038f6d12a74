Diablo III is set to launch on the Nintendo Switch later this year, according to leaked information. An article detailing the launch of the game was published on Forbes and quickly taken down, but not before it was captured by a Reddit user. According to the information, the version of Diablo III coming to the Switch will include all currently-available content for the title, in addition to exclusive extras. These include the Legend of Ganondorf cosmetic armour set, Tri-Force portrait frame, Chicken pet, and Echoes of the Mask cosmetic wings. Diablo III on the Switch will support local co-op for up to four players and can be played in the console’s docked and portable configurations. The game will be priced at $60 and will be playable online through Nintendo’s online service – which is set to launch next month.
