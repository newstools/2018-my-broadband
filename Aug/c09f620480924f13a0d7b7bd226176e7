Niantic is adding a host of new gameplay features to Pokémon Go, the company told Gram. Among these new features is a long-awaited player-versus-player (PvP) combat system, which allows trainers to pit their Pokémon against each other. Niantic said its PvP mode will appear near the end of the year. It is also working on improving existing features such as trading and friends lists, it added. The developer said it would add a number of new Pokémon to the game, too, although it did not say when the new creatures will be added. Niantic added that its Harry Potter: Wizards Unite mobile game is set to release at the end of 2018.
