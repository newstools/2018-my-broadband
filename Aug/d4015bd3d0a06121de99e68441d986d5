Putting certain stickers on your laptop may not be a good idea, according to a report by Motherboard. The report referenced security experts who stated that certain stickers – like a Bitcoin logo or a political party emblem – can cause trouble for their owners. A Bitcoin sticker on your laptop, for example, can make you a potential target for hackers who may be on the lookout for target who owns cryptocurrency. If the laptop lid has a Bitcoin sticker, there is a good chance access to a Bitcoin wallet can be found on the machine. Similarly, a sticker indicating a certain political affiliation or ideology may result in the user and their laptop being red-flagged by government agencies as a person to watch out for. Tactical Tech told Motherboard that they know of a case where a hacker missed a flight as he was detained at an airport over his stickers. The company stated that while it is “okay to be yourself and have fun” by placing your favourite stickers on your laptop, “nothing comes without risk”.
