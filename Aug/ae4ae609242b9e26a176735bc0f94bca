YouTube has unveiled a new suite of fundraising tools under the name YouTube Giving. The tools include Fundraisers, Community fundraisers, Campaign matching, and Super Chat for Good. The Fundraisers feature allows YouTube creators to create and embed fundraising campaigns in their video descriptions, allowing viewers to donate through YouTube’s payment processing platform. Community fundraisers allow multiple creators to co-host the same fundraiser, with the campaign appearing in multiple videos simultaneously and reflecting the total amount raised across the platform. The Campaign matching feature allows creators who are attempting to raise money to receive matching pledges from other creators or brands. Super Chat for Good will enable creators to raise funds through YouTube’s Super Chat system.
