Facebook has launched a new set of time management features to help users reduce the amount of time they spend on social media. The company launched the new tools for Facebook and Instagram platforms. To access the tools, users can navigate to the settings page in either app. Instagram users should tap “Your Activity”, and Facebook users should tap “Your Time on Facebook”. Users will now be presented with an average time for that application on that device, along with a dashboard which allows them to customise their social media experience. The new dashboard also allows users to set a reminder to alert them when they have reached their self-imposed daily time limit for social media.
