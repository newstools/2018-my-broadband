Internet Solutions will become “more open and actively engage in peering”, the company has stated. The decision follows a review of its peering policy, and the company will now implement several changes to promote better interconnection. “The advantages of a more open peering policy mean that local traffic will be served more directly to end users of the service, while reducing the amount of traffic that needs to leave our shores in order to access content that is available locally,” said IS. “Peering is broadly defined as two Internet service providers connecting to exchange traffic directly with each other to benefit each other’s networks. IS will be taking a more open approach to peering and the overall theme of the revised peering policy is to be simpler and more inclusive.” This will result in numerous opportunities and an improved user experience, it said. “We are also making it simpler for content delivery network providers to peer with us.”
