Google has revealed an overhauled version of its Wear OS software for smartwatches. The new design of the operating system for Android wearables allows easier access to useful functions such as notifications, information, and Google Assistant. Browsing, dismissing, and taking actions on notifications is now much easier, and users can select built-in smart replies without leaving their notification stream. Google Assistant can also now provide more proactive help based on the user’s location, weather, and travel route – offering advice for attire and notifications of any traffic delays. While this functionality may vary by country, device, and smartphone operating system, Google hopes to roll out the overhauled OS to all Wear OS smartwatches in the coming month.
