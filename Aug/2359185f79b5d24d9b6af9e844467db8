Amazon is currently working on a free video service for its Fire TV streaming devices, The Information reported. Sources familiar with the matter told the Information that the new service would be named Free Dive and would be supported by advertising revenue. Free Dive is being developed by Amazon’s IMDB subsidiary and will reportedly feature older TV shows and film rights acquired from Amazon’s ongoing discussions with studios, stated the report.
