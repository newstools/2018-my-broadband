Ntuthuzelo Vanara is set to join the SABC, according to sources who spoke to the Sunday Times. The report stated that Vanara will become the head of legal affairs at the SABC. Vanara – who is an advocate – is known for helping parliament discovery dodgy dealings at the SABC and Eskom. The reported move comes at a time when the SABC is under massive financial pressure. The situation is so bad that the broadcaster has been unable to secure Bafana Bafana and Banyana Banyana broadcast rights. The SABC reportedly owes the South African Football Association over R50 million for its previous broadcast contract, which ended in April 2018.
