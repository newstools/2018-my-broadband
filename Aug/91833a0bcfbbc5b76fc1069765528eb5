Google has released an update for Google Maps which changes the way the Earth is depicted when users zoom all the way out. The Earth is no longer portrayed as a flat surface and is now shown as a globe on the Google Maps desktop application. Google previously used traditional Mercator projection to create a flat depiction of Earth, which makes it easier to portray maps in two-dimensional formats ‚Äì but distorts the size of landmasses. For example, Greenland previously seemed larger than Africa on Google Maps, while the new 3D globe depiction portrays real landmass sizes ‚Äì with Africa 14-times the size of Greenland. This follows a number of recent changes to the Google Maps platform, including improved location sharing with the addition of battery life information and a new recommendations system. With 3D Globe Mode on Google Maps desktop, Greenland's projection is no longer the size of Africa.
