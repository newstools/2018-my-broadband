Information security firm ESET will launch an online tool to help organisations assess their compliance with the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI). Speaking at ESET Security Day in Johannesburg, Steve Flynn, the director of sales and marketing for ESET Southern Africa, said they expect to launch the tool in the next 4-6 weeks. The tool was developed in collaboration with Michalsons Attorneys, specialists in POPI, privacy, and data protection – and will be hosted using Amazon Web Services, managed by ESET, and geared towards SMEs. Flynn said that the ESET POPI self-assessment portal will be available for an affordable price and offer the following services: The assessment uses 138 yes/no questions, arranged into six sections, to produce a report of your current level of compliance. There is extra information and examples on every question to help you answer accurately, and you may request more information on any question you don’t understand.

This will also be hosted in AWS and be managed by ESET. “This will essentially add a new component to the reseller business model – that of POPI solutions and services.” This article was published in partnership with ESET.
