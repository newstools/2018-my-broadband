MTN’s new fibre packages – sold under the Supersonic brand – have been posted online on the company’s new website. MTN officially launches Supersonic – a rebrand of Smart Village which is under new management – today, 30 August 2018. MTN said its Supersonic packages will come with full installation, device set-up, on-site technical support, and a dedicated relationship manager for telephonic support. There will also not be contracts, with all packages available on a month-to-month basis, stated the website. A cancellation charge will apply, however, if a customer cancels the service prior to “the expiration of the applicable claw back period”. At the time of publication, Supersonic was offering uncapped fibre packages across a range of line speeds. Fibre networks which currently support the uncapped packages include Supersonic’s own network, Openserve, and Vumatel. Supersonic’s uncapped fibre packages also offer a range of add-ons, depending on which package is selected – including free fibre installation, a free router, and an on-site Wi-Fi coverage assessment and set-up. Packages from 10Mbps and up will also receive a free smart Wi-Fi device, which is listed as a Plume Wi-Fi system. Supersonic’s website states that smart Wi-Fi offer consists of one device and its management fee. Additional smart Wi-Fi devices are charged at the rates below: VoIP services are also available to customers at an additional cost. The table below details Supersonic’s uncapped pricing. Supersonic stated that all customers will be subject to an acceptable use policy, but data limits were not stipulated. Supersonic reserves the right to take action to prevent improper, excessive, or abusive use of the product or service, it said. “Such action includes but is not limited to throttling, suspension or deactivation of a customer’s usage, where usage is deemed excessive, fraudulent and/or in contravention of the law.”
