Google CEO Sundar Pichai told employees at a recent meeting that the company was not close to launching a search product in China, CNBC reported. While Google would like to expand its services in China, it is not clear that it would, or could, said Pichai. The company faced backlash from employees after The Intercept published a report stating that it planned to launch a censored version of its search engine in China. According to the New York Times, at least 1,400 employees have signed a letter calling for transparency regarding the product. The Interceptâ€™s report stated that Google had diverted resources to create custom apps for China, which had been demonstrated to the members of the Chinese government. Pending approval, the service could be launched in the next nine months, the report stated.
