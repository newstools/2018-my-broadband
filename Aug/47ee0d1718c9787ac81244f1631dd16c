SuperSport announced that its selection of channels will soon be available in full HD. The company confirmed to MyBroadband that its satellite channels in South Africa will offer full HD resolution going forward. This will be accomplished by upgrading the broadcast resolution of SS9 and Maximo, the remaining channels available in standard definition. SuperSport 9 will upgrade from 15 August 2018, meaning the Serie A matches can be viewed in full HD. Portuguese football channel Maximo will switch to full HD a week earlier. “Being able to offer all our customers the full complement of our channels in full HD is a momentous occasion for us,” said SuperSport CEO Gideon Khobane. SuperSport’s offering currently stands at 14 channels.
