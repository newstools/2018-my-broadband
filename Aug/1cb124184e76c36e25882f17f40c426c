MyBroadband’s latest speed test results show that MTN and Vodacom provide the highest mobile data speeds in Gauteng shopping malls. Over the last two months, MyBroadband conducted thousands of download, upload, and latency tests inside prominent shopping malls in Gauteng. These tests were conducted using a custom version of the popular Android Speed Test App running on Samsung Galaxy S8 and S9 smartphones. MyBroadband’s speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure a neutral testing environment. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to the MyBroadband Speed Test platform. The tables below show how the operators performed in each shopping mall, ranked according to download speed. Each red dot with a green circle around it indicates a single speed test. The red dots get bigger when multiple tests are performed in close proximity.
