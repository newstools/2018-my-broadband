Cape Town’s Internet Exchange (CINX) has been extended to a third location in Diep River, said INX-ZA. “CINX now encompasses three sites hosted by Liquid Telecom in Diep Rivier, Teraco in Rondebosch, and Internet Solutions in Parklands,” it said. “INXs help Internet service providers route traffic locally, helping to contain costs in a tight economy, while users benefit from reduced latencies,” added Malcolm Siegel, INX-ZA committee member. Siegel added that Internet exchanges in South Africa have historically been limited to a single location – requiring network operators using the exchange to invest in infrastructure connecting to that location. “The extensions undertaken by INX-ZA makes it easy for Internet companies which already have infrastructure at existing INX locations to connect seamlessly to networks at new locations.” Peers at the new site will have the same peering experience and will be able to be directly linked to all existing and future CINX peers, he said.
