Samsung has unveiled its 8K QLED TVs. The Samsung Q900R QLED 8K will be available in four sizes: 65-inch, 75-inch, 82-inch, and 85-inch. The TV will feature “real” 8K resolutions, artificial intelligence upscaling, and several 8K-ready enhancements. These include Q HDR 8K and and Quantum Processor 8K. Its Real 8K Resolution is a standard supported by most film studios and allows the TV to produce four times more pixels than a 4K TV. The TV will also be able to run at this resolution at a peak brightness of 4,000 nit, said Samsung. Q HDR 8K is a high dynamic range feature powered by HDR10+ technology. This optimises the TV’s brightness to produce crisper images and more accurate colours. 8K AI Upscaling is proprietary Samsung technology to produce picture and sound quality compatible with 8K, regardless of the original source quality or format. “Whether a user is watching content through a streaming service, set-top box, HDMI, USB, or even mobile mirroring, the Quantum Processor 8K recognises and upscales the content to appear in 8K quality,” said Samsung. “In addition, the Q900R features Direct Full Array Elite for enhanced contrast and precise backlighting control, and also 100% colour volume, enabling users to witness billions of shades of colour for the purest color accuracy.” Samsung’s QLED 8K TVs will be available from the end of September 2018.
