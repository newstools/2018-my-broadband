Netflix has confirmed it is showing video adverts for new series between episodes of shows for certain users. Multiple reports have stated that users are furious about the change, which they said is “as bad as commercials”. The video adverts play at the end of an episode a user is watching and suggest new content for them to try out. According to Netflix, only a “small percentage” of users are currently exposed to this. The adverts are reported to be skippable, but this had not stopped multiple users complaining about the change – stating that they pay their monthly Netflix fee to avoid using a streaming service which shows adverts. “We are testing whether surfacing recommendations between episodes helps members discover stories they will enjoy faster,” said Netflix. There are no details on whether the feature will roll out to all users.
