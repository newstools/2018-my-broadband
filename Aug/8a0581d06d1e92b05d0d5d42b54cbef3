Netflix is working on how to bypass iTunes for its subscription payments in 33 countries, TechCrunch reported. New subscribers in selected markets will be unable to pay for new subscriptions through iTunes until 30 September 2018, Netflix told TechCrunch. The test has been active since June across 10 countries, and has now expanded to cover 33 markets â€“ including South Africa. Instead of allowing users to sign up through iTunes, Netflix now directs potential subscribers in affected countries to its mobile web interface. By directly billing customers and not allowing them to subscribe through iTunes or the Google Play store, Netflix skips giving Google and Apple a cut of the earnings from those subscriptions. Apple currently takes a 30% cut on the first year of Netflix subscriptions, and 15% after this period, if customers sign up through iTunes.
