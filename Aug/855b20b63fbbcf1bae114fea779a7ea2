MultiChoice and the SABC have signed a new commercial channel supply agreement which will allow the SABC News and SABC Encore channels to continue broadcasting on DStv. The signing of the agreement took place as the previous contract was set to expire and followed extensive discussions between the two companies. “SABC and MultiChoice believe that this agreement will give their relationship a new start,” said the SABC in a statement. SABC News offers 24-hour news coverage on channel 404, while SABC Encore airs classic shows from the SABC archives on channel 156. “The SABC welcomes the new agreement with MultiChoice which will bring certainty to our viewers and our staff,” said SABC CEO Madoda Mxakwe. “We are pleased to be able to continue to carry these channels on DStv,” added MultiChoice South Africa CEO Calvo Mawela. “We have a long-standing relationship with SABC and are happy that we have reached a mutually-beneficial agreement.” The new channel agreement comes after the original agreement was signed in 2013 and faced opposition from multiple industry players. This included Media Monitoring Africa and Caxton Publishers approaching the Competition Commission in 2015 over the deal. Details also emerged that part of the agreement was a penalty clause that would kick in if any of the SABC’s channels were to be encrypted or protected with a conditional access system.
