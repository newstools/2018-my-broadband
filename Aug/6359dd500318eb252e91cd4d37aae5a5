AMD has unveiled its latest Radeon Pro WX workstation graphics card, the WX 8200. The company said the GPU delivers the “best workstation graphics performance for under $1,000”, and is aimed at real-time visualisation, virtual reality, and photorealistic rendering tasks. “Based on the advanced Vega GPU architecture with the 14nm FinFET process, the Radeon Pro WX 8200 graphics card offers the performance required to drive increasingly large and complex models through the entire design visualisation pipeline,” said AMD. It also packs 8GB of Error Correcting Code RAM, produces 10.8 teraflops of performance, and will sell for $999 in the US from early September 2018. AMD also punted that fact that the card features a state-of-the-art memory system, enhanced pixel engine, and AMD Secure Processor.
