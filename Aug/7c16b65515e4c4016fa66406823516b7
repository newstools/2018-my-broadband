While South Africa’s total gaming downloads are tiny compared to the rest of the world, they are massive compared to other African countries. Steam’s download statistics for the past seven days – as of 29 August 2018 – show that South Africa is easily the biggest country in Africa for Steam game downloads – with many other African countries showing extremely small total download amounts in comparison. In fact, the total amount of data downloaded over Steam in Ethiopia throughout this period was 980.5GB, which could easily fit on a standard 1TB mechanical hard drive, commonly found in laptops and desktop PCs. This is a paltry score, especially in comparison to the petabytes downloaded every week by countries like the United States, China, and Russia. South Africa’s total data downloaded over the seven-day period easily outstrips other countries across Africa, including Algeria and Morocco. However, Kenya boasts a higher average download speed than South Africa and Morocco’s is equal to the local average of 7.7Mbps. Many African countries, such as South Sudan and Chad, feature tiny scores with slow average download speeds of under 2Mbps. The average download speeds and downloaded data for South Africa and other major African countries are detailed below. When it comes to the global comparison, South Africa ranks poorly among its peers in Europe, America, and Asia. While South Africa’s weekly downloaded data over Steam reaches just over half a petabyte, various European countries boast tens of petabytes per week. Major powers like the United States, China, and Russia feature up to 50 petabytes downloaded over Steam every week. The average download speeds and downloaded data for South Africa and other major countries around the world are below.
