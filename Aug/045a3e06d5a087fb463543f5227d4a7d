Samsung has developed a 5G modem that is fully compatible with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 15 standard – the Exynos Modem 5100. Built on 10-nanometre process technology, Samsung said the new modem is power efficient and supports legacy radio access technologies – including 2G GSM/CDMA, 3G WCDMA, TD-SCDMA, HSPA, and LTE. The Exynos Modem 5100 also supports sub-6GHz and millimetre-wave spectrums specified in the 3GPP’s 5G standard. It delivers a maximum downlink speed of up to 2Gbps in 5G’s sub-6GHz settings and 6Gbps in mmWave settings. Samsung further promised fast and stable data communications in 4G networks, with downlink speeds of 1.6Gbps. “As 5G is expected to be first deployed over existing network infrastructures, commercial implementation will benefit from the single-chip design that maximizes data transmission efficiency and reliability between other communication networks,” said Samsung. The Exynos Modem 5100 will be offered with radio frequency IC, envelope tracking, and power management IC solutions. It will be available by the end of 2018.
