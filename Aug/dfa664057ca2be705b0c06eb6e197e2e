Audio Technica has unveiled its new Sound Reality ATH-CKR7TW True Wireless in-ear headphones, which deliver high-quality sound without any cables. Each earbud sports an 11mm driver with a carbon-coated diaphragm, which the company said allows for fast response times with reduced distortion. The earphones connect to devices via Bluetooth, offer six hours of battery life, and can be charged via a USB cable. Touch controls located on the earbuds can be used to control music playback and accept or deny phone calls. The earphones are also shipped with a compact carry case, which provides nine hours of additional use through charging. Audio Technica’s new earphones will be available in a variety of sizes and will launch later this year.
