Cell C’s Black streaming service is gaining traction in South Africa, according to data published in the company’s interim results for the period ended 30 June 2018. The platform has seen increased subscriber interest as it launched various promotions in partnership with Cell C and increased the selection of content available. Speaking to MyBroadband in February 2018, Black chief executive Surie Ramasary said the streaming service was seeing increased adoption across mobile users. As of the beginning of February 2018, the Black mobile application had over 100,000 downloads on Android and over 9,000 on iOS. Ramasary said at the time that customers were drawn to the service due to the ability to purchase content with prepaid airtime. According to data published in Cell’s latest interim results, Black’s subscriber base is comprised largely of Cell C customers. “Cell C customers make up 70% of subscribers on Black, with 30% of subscribers belonging to other networks,” it said. The results also stated that 2.5 million customers have “browsed” the Black platform to date, and listed current user log-ins at 80,000. The number of customers on Black’s free trial is 260,000 and the number of completed transactions on the platform is 60,000. According to the Digital Lifestyle Measure report by MBI-T, Black is the top streaming service for the DLM 3 market – which represent a large portion of the population in South Africa. Awareness of the Black streaming service has also grown 14% among high-tech users, according to the data. “There has been a sharp increase in content consumption since Cell C zero-rated its data for Black content streaming,” added Cell C.
