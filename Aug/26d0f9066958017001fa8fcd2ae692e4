Mozilla has announced that Firefox will soon block tracking scripts, such as those used by advertising networks, by default. “Some sites will continue to want user data in exchange for content, but now they will have to ask for it, a positive change for people who up until now had no idea of the value exchange they were asked to make,” said Mozilla. Changes to Firefox will roll out over the next few months and will focus on three key initiatives, said Mozilla. “Firefox will strip cookies and block storage access from third-party tracking content.” “We’ve already made this available for our Firefox Nightly users to try out, and will be running a shield study to test the experience with some of our beta users in September.” The aim is to roll out this feature to all users in Firefox 65. Firefox will also enable a default block against trackers that fingerprint users by their device properties and sites that use crypto-mining scripts, in the future.
