The BBC has obtained subpoenas to try and track down the person responsible for leaking a clip from the new Doctor Who series, TorrentFreak reported. In July 2018, the BBC obtained a subpoena from a US federal court which ordered Tapatalk to identify the source of a post which it alleged infringed on its rights. Tapatalk is an app which provides access to online forums. BBC Studios has since filed for a separate Digital Millennium Copyright Act subpoena in a Washington federal court, aimed at Microsoft. “The infringing material includes an unauthorised copy of copyrighted video content from Season 11, Episode 1 of Doctor Who,” said the BBC. Its filing states that a user stored a shared copy of the offending clip in Microsoft’s cloud storage platform, OneDrive, and requests that Microsoft hand over any information that might help identify the user. This includes a name, account name, address, telephone number, email address, birth date, profile photo, device information, browser information, location information, time posted, and information from other services such as Facebook.
