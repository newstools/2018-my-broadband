Twitter has removed support for a number of third-party applications and outdated developer tools. The company said in a blog post it chose to stop supporting a number of third-party applications to focus on improving Twitter for iOS, Android, and its web platform. Third-party applications such as Tweetbot has already removed certain functionality to mitigate the effect of these changes, crippling many of its features. The company also dropped support for Twitter on Apple Watch and Twitter for Mac, and has replaced its Twitter for Windows App with its new web application. “We feel the best Twitter experience we can provide today is through our owned and operated Twitter for iOS and Android apps, as well as desktop and mobile twitter.com,” said Twitter. These changes form part of Twitter’s recent push to improve its platform, which includes mitigating the effect of troll-like behaviour.
