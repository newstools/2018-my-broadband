LG has shown off its new 8K (7,680 x 4,320) OLED TV at IFA 2018. The 88-inch display is the first 8K OLED TV in the world, boasting over 33 million self-emitting pixels. LG said the display also maintains the impressive contrast ratio and true blacks which define its OLED lineup. The company sees a bright future ahead for the display technology, stating that OLED TV shipments are expected to double in 2018 and reach over nine million units by 2022. “LG’s first 8K OLED TV is the pinnacle of technological achievement and the next evolutionary step in display technology,” said LG Home Entertainment president Brian Kwon. “4K OLED played a major role in reshaping the TV industry and LG is confident that 8K OLED will do the same.” There is currently no pricing or release date information available for the 8K OLED TV.
