Facebook has launched augmented reality games in the video chat feature of Messenger. Up to six people can play at a time, allowing users to challenge friends to one of two games: Don’t Smile, and Asteroids Attack. “We’re planning to roll out more games in the coming weeks and months – including passing a beach ball back and forth with Beach Bump and a matching cat game with Kitten Kraze,” said Facebook. To try out the games, Facebook said you need to have the latest version of Messenger installed. You may then open an existing conversation or find a person or group you would like to chat with, tap the video icon on the top-right corner of the screen, then tap the star button and select one of the AR games. “The person or group you are video chatting with will get a notification indicating it’s time to get your game on,” said Facebook.
