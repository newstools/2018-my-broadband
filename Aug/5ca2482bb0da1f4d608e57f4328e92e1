MTN has told MyBroadband that Smart Village is being rebranded as Supersonic. MTN stated that later this month, it will launch Supersonic – the rebrand of Smart Village which is under new management “with renewed focus and direction”. The operator’s statement follows an event invite which was sent to media detailing the launch of the new fibre-to-the-home brand. “Supersonic will target homes and small businesses,” added MTN. The event invite stated that Supersonic will offer “fibre that’s super simple to understand and customisable enough to create a connection to the Internet that makes sense for your needs”. “It’s Internet as it should be. No nonsense – we don’t deal in confusing jargon and complicated tech-talk. We don’t deal in extended contracts and we don’t deal in time lags,” added the invite. MTN said its Supersonic packages will come with full installation, device setup, on-site technical support, and a dedicated relationship manager for telephonic support.  MTN acquired Smart Village for a cash consideration of R220 million and a deferred consideration of R12 million in November 2016. The deal expanded MTN’s fibre-to-the-home footprint across the country, and at the time, Smart Village had a fibre network which past 22,000 homes – connecting 7,000 homes in Gauteng, the Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal. MTN said the deal would also bolster MTN’s presence in the enterprise space by giving MTN Business the ability to provide wholesale access to enterprises.
