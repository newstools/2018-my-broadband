MultiChoice has selected Newzroom Afrika to produce a new 24-hour news channel for DStv. Newzroom Afrika was created by Eclipse TV’s Thokozani Nkosi and Rapid Innovation’s Thabile Ngwato, who have already assembled an editorial and broadcast team. “Today marks the birth of an exciting new and independent media voice in South Africa,” said MultiChoice SA CEO Calvo Mawela. “We set out to find a quality new, black-owned, independent news channel to expand the diversity of SA news and enrich our democracy – we’re excited by the outcome.” As with other news channels on DStv, MultiChoice will have no editorial oversight over Newzroom Afrika. “This is a great opportunity for us to bring a fresh perspective to South African news media by building a news channel from scratch. We’re excited and raring to go,” said Nkosi. MultiChoice and Newzroom Afrika said they will start negotiating the terms of a channel distribution agreement shortly. Newzroom Afrika is a replacement for ANN7 – which became Afro Worldview – the formerly Gupta-owned news channel which was taken off DStv earlier this month.
