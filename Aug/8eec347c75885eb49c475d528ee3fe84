The SABC is unable to negotiate a new Bafana Bafana and Banyana Banyana broadcast rights contract due to its money problems, Times Live reported. The SABC reportedly owes the South African Football Association over R50 million for its previous broadcast contract, which ended in April 2018. SAFA CEO Dennis Mumble said the broadcaster has an indifferent attitude towards football. “They have just been refusing to enter into an agreement with us because they say they do not have any money‚” Mumble told Times Live. “So what they want to do is substantially reduce the fee that we charge them or they paid during the last contract.” “In the last two discussions we have had with them‚ and this is with the top leadership of the SABC‚ the position was we do not have money and we want to be a responsible broadcaster and therefore we cannot spend money. Can you please help us convince government to give us money.” Mumble said that regulation which forced SAFA to sign a broadcast deal with the SABC could result in disaster for the association, as it would earn no revenue from broadcasting. He said there is a strong possibility that Bafana’s Africa Nations Cup qualifier matches against Libya in September and Seychelles in October will not be broadcast on television or radio locally.
