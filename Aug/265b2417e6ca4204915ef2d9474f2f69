Samsung has started mass producing the industry’s first 4TB SSD based on 4-bit quad-level cell (QLC) technology. With its new 1 terabit 4-bit V-NAND chip, Samsung said it will also be able to efficiently produce a 128GB memory card for smartphones which will lead the charge toward higher capacities. The company said that as data stored within a memory cell increases from three bits to four, the chip capacity per unit area would typically rise and the electrical charge – which is used to determine information from a sensor – would decrease by as much as 50%. This makes it considerably more difficult to maintain a device’s desired performance and speed. Samsung said its 4-bit 4TB QLC SSD maintains the same performance levels as a 3-bit SSD. It achieves this by using a 3-bit SSD controller and TurboWrite technology. The 4-bit QLC SSD promises a sequential read speed of 540MB/s, and a sequential write speed of 520MB/s. Samsung said it plans to introduce several 4-bit consumer SSDs later this year, with 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities in a 2.5-inch form factor. The company also expects to provide M.2 NVMe SSDs for enterprises and start mass production of 4-bit 5th-generation V-NAND.
