Darren Brinkley, who was sued in a Utah federal court in 2017 for the alleged illegal sharing of the movie “Criminal”, has demanded that Criminal Productions, which filed the complaint, carry his legal costs, TorrentFreak reported. TorrentFreak noted that a common practice among copyright owners is to watch the public activity on the BitTorrent network and subpoena the private details of people sharing their movies. Lawyers representing the copyright owner then contact the person, demanding that they pay an amount to settle the issue or face legal action. There is usually no intent to take the matter to court, so the practice has been dubbed “copyright trolling.” When Brinkley fought back and denied the accusations, however, Criminal Productions did not back down. This resulted in him having to employ the services of legal counsel. When Criminal Productions realised that a “Motion to Compel discovery” was in draft, it asked the court for a voluntary dismissal of the case, which was granted. The case dragged on for a year, resulting in a $62,000 legal bill for Brinkley. “These tactics should at minimum require that defendant Brinkley be made whole for the plaintiff’s filing of litigation,” said his lawyer.
