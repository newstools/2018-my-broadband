Telkom’s website has been experiencing downtime since yesterday, with many users expressing frustration with not being able to access the site. “Telkom’s website was down last night. Wanted to pay for my ADSL with a credit card, and I see it is still down at 06:17,” a user said this morning. It was not immediately clear what was causing the downtime, but users speculated that routing problems are the cause. The downtime follows a problem in July 2018 where the URL http://telkom.co.za/ presented a plain white page, with the words “Hello World” at the top. Telkom was asked for comment about the issues its website has suffered, but the company did not reply to questions.
