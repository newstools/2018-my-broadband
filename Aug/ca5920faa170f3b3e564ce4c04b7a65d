MTN’s share price dropped by over 20% on Thursday after Nigeria ordered four banks to return $8.1 billion they say was illegally expatriated by MTN. The four banks – Stanbic, Citigroup, Standard Chartered, and Diamond Bank – will be fined about 5.9 billion naira ($16 million), said Nigeria’s central bank. MTN was also ordered to participate in the refund. The order comes almost two years after MTN was first accused of the practice. Nigeria’s senate said in 2016 that it was investigating the same four banks for transferring almost $14 billion for MTN in breach of the country’s foreign-exchange rules. MTN said in 2016 that it obtained central bank approvals before any dividends were issued. “The re-emergence of these issues is regrettable as it damages investor confidence and, by extension, inhibits the growth and development of the Nigerian economy,” MTN said in a statement. “We will engage with the relevant authorities and vigorously defend our position on this matter and provide further information when available.” The decision follows MTN settling a separate $1-billion fine in Nigeria for missing a deadline to disconnect unregistered customers. Negotiations over that penalty went on for almost a year and weighed heavily on the share price. As part of the settlement, MTN agreed to list its local unit in Lagos and is planning to do so this year. MTN’s share price dropped to below R85 per share on Thursday after it closed at over R107 per share on Wednesday. The chart below shows the MTN share price over the last five days.
