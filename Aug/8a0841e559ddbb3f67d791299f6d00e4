Samsung has unveiled its latest tablet, the Galaxy Tab S4. The new device is punted as a tablet which offers high levels of power and productivity, and as a potential replacement for a work laptop. Samsung has fitted the tablet with a 10.5-inch display, Snapdragon 835 chipset, Android 8.1, and the company’s Dex system – which provides a desktop experience on mobile devices. “The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 is the perfect device for those who need something portable like a tablet and capable like a PC,” said Samsung. The Tab S4 also includes an S Pen and an optional Book Cover Keyboard, which activates the Dex interface when connected to the tablet. “With Samsung Dex, you can open multiple desktop-style windows for your Android apps, including the Microsoft Office suite, directly on the Galaxy Tab S4, and resize them when needed.” Users can also connect the tablet to an external monitor when using the Dex interface, using an appropriate adapter. “When connected, the Galaxy Tab S4 can serve as a track pad or a sketch pad,” added Samsung. The device is powered by a 7,300mAh battery, which is said to provide 16 hours of video playback time. Samsung further punted the Galaxy Tab S4’s inclusion of Samsung-specific features, including Samsung Knox and Samsung Flow. “Samsung Flow allows users to manage all of their devices easily by connecting and transferring files, tasks, and notifications seamlessly,” said Samsung. Other features in the tablet include four speakers tuned by AKG, which support Dolby Atmos sound technology. The 64GB storage version of the tablet is available for $650 in the US, while the 256GB model is $750. The keyboard cover for the device sells for $150.    <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
