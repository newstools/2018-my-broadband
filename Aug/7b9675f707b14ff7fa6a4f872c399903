If you don’t use a SIM card, or recharge it with airtime or data, your mobile network is likely to disconnect you and recycle your number. As covered by MyBroadband in August 2017, networks recycle unused mobile numbers when they are not used for a certain period as there are a limited quantity of cellphone numbers available. At the time, Vodacom offered the longest dormancy period – 185 days. Cell C, MTN, and Telkom gave users a 90-day window, after which you lose your number. These rules apply to prepaid SIMs. With contract SIMs, you number is yours until your contract expires. The launch of Rain Mobile introduced an interesting variable into this industry equation, however. Rain Mobile’s current offering of pay-as-you-use at R50 per GB means the SIM cards it provides clients are not contract SIMs, nor are they prepaid SIMs. MyBroadband spoke to Rain Mobile about its stance on SIM expiry and number recycling, and it said it currently does not enforce an expiry window. “Currently, we do not provide any rules around the expiry of our SIM cards. We made this decision to firstly understand customer behaviour on a data-only network,” said Rain. “It does not follow a traditional model in terms of MSISDNs, payments, as well as top-ups. Over time, we will monitor usage and user patterns and formulate rules around the expiry of SIMs.”
