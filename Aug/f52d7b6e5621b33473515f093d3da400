Google has launched YouTube Go in South Africa. “YouTube Go has been built from the ground up for the next generation of YouTube users, keeping in mind their needs, preferences, and aspirations so they can enter and fully access the world of video,” said Google. The app features a simple user interface and an “offline first” philosophy – letting it work when there is low, or no, connectivity. YouTube Go also provides transparency in how users are using their data, added Google. “With YouTube Go, we want to make it possible for everyone in South Africa to be able to discover and share videos that they love, regardless of their data consumption preference.” YouTube Go is available from the Google Play store, and will come installed on all Android 8.1 Go Edition phones.
