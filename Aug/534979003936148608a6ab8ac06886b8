Huawei has launched the latest smartphone in its Honor line-up, the Honor Note 10. The device sports a 7-inch 1,080 x 2,220 AMOLED display powered by an array of high-end hardware, including the manufacturer’s Kirin 970 processor. The Honor Note 10 comes equipped with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM, and 64GB or 128GB of storage capacity. Its 5,000mAh battery is impressively large compared to competing devices, and the phone has omitted a headphone jack in favour of a single-port design. The Honor Note 10 is substantially larger than the previous-generation Honor Note device, which had a 6.6-inch display. Huawei said the device will launch exclusively in China and will be priced at ¥2,799 (R5,800).
