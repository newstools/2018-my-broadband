Netflix recently announced new rand pricing for the service in South Africa, and that it is dropping US dollar charges locally. The company also stated it will bring more local content to South Africans. “Since launching in the country in January 2016, the content library on the Netflix SA service has grown by over 500%, with shows that speak to South African audiences such as Girlboss, Mindhunter, and Troy: Fall of a City,” said Netflix. More locally-developed content will be added to its library, which will include exclusive series, movies, documentaries, stand-up comedy shows, and kids content. The news of more local content was a cause of concern for many Netflix users, however, who asked the question: Does this mean we will receive less international content? With a push to supply more South African content on the platform, there was the worry that this would come at the expense of international content and Netflix originals. Netflix has told MyBroadband that users do not have have to worry, though, as this will not be the case. “We continuously work on bringing joy and providing a more localised service for our members in South Africa,” said Netflix. “However, the international and Netflix original content will not be affected.” International Netflix originals such as Narcos and Stranger Things are big hits on Netflix across the world – with local audiences no exception. In November 2017, Netflix stated that the most popular shows in South Africa were Stranger Things, Narcos, Mindhunters, Star Trek: Discovery, Designated Survivor, Shooter, and Marvel series.
