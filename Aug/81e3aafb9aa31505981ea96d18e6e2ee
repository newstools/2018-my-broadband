Atomic Access is the latest ISP to launch fibre products in South Africa, with aggressive pricing on home and business services. The ISP’s products are available on three fibre networks – Openserve, Octotel, and Frogfoot – with plans to connect to three more networks by the end of 2018. Nicholas Soper, MD of Atomic Access, told MyBroadband the company was part of an experiment to see if they could build an ISP in under six months. “We wanted to see if we could build a better ISP if it had no ADSL legacy and was built the way we would want an ISP to be built,” said Soper. “We simply wanted the best-quality Internet, with low latency and didn’t want to be a number on hold in the queue for support.” The company launched its public offerings this week, but has been servicing a group of family and friends in recent months. “We started with a single 100Mbps upstream Internet connection. Today, we have over a gigabit of international capacity, with two upstream providers and various 10Gbps links to fibre network operators and NAPAfrica,” said Soper. The company’s infrastructure is hosted at Teraco in Rondebosch, with its own AS number, IP address space, and NAPAfrica Joburg PoP. “Our network is now fully dual-stack with IPv4 and native IPv6 on all routers. We average around 140ms latency to London, which keeps our gamer friends happy.” Although it has only been operating since February, Soper said the company is profitable and they were happy to let it grow at a steady rate. “Our growth strategy is very simple: provide a great service and give customers up to 10% in monthly discounts if they invite their friends to join,” said Soper.
