ZTE South Africa operations are “on track and at full capacity”, the company has stated. “ZTE South Africa resumed operations immediately following the lifting of the ban by the US government,” it said. This recent ban from the US government resulted in ZTE suspending business operations globally. The US and ZTE reached a settlement agreement in June 2018, however, which saw the ban being overturned and a fine paid. “The company has implemented all of the compliance requirements… with a brand new board of directors and global executive management team,” said ZTE. “Moreover, ZTE and all its South African customers and alliance partners have resumed full business activities.” During the ban on ZTE, local mobile operators which used its equipment and services told MyBroadband they would assess the impact of the sanctions.
