Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed during an earnings call that the company will develop its own chips for self-driving cars called “Hardware 3,” TechCrunch reported. Hardware 3 is to be swapped into Model S, Model X, and Model 3 vehicles from Tesla, where it will perform all the computation necessary for the auto pilot functionality. Tesla currently relies on chips developed by Nvidia for this, and it said the switch will allow it to focus on its own needs and improve efficiency. According to Musk, Nvidia’s chips allowed it to process about 200 frames per second for computer vision. Hardware 3 will offer a 10-fold increase. The Hardware 3 upgrades are set to roll out from next year, said Tesla.
