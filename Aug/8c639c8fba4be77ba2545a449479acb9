Huawei Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu unveiled the company’s new Kirin 980 system-on-a-chip (SoC) at IFA 2018 in Berlin, Germany. The chipset is the world’s first commercial SoC manufactured with TSMC’s 7nm process and will be used in Huawei’s next-generation smartphones. Using this technology, the Kirin 980 packs 6.9 billion transistors within a 1cm2 die, delivering 20% more performance and 40% more power efficiency compared to chips which used the 10nm manufacturing process. The Neural Processing Unit (NPU) first debuted on the Kirin 970 processor is retained and paired with another identical chip for greatly-improved AI performance. “This year, we’ve designed an all-round powerhouse that not only features outstanding AI capabilities, but also brings cutting-edge raw performance to consumers,” said Yu. “Equipped with all-new CPU, GPU and Dual NPU, the Kirin 980 is the ultimate engine to power next-generation productivity and entertainment applications.” The Kirin 980 also features Cortex-A76 processor cores, which are 75% more powerful and 58% more efficient than previous generations. Huawei has also improved the graphics capabilities of its mobile processor by including the powerful Mali-G76 GPU on its Kirin 980 chipset. The Kirin 980’s LTE modem supports carrier aggregation and LTE Cat.21 with a peak download speed of 1.4Gbps. The company confirmed that the Kirin 980 SoC would power its new Mate-series smartphone, which is set to launch in October 2018.
