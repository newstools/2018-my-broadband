Microsoft has released the latest update for its Windows 10 Insider Preview build, which includes new functionality for interfacing with Android smartphones. The update includes the first set of features for the Your Phone app, which allows users to seamlessly share files between their smartphone and their Windows 10 PC. The application syncs the most recent photos on the userâ€™s Android device to their PC automatically, and the smartphone sharing interface can be accessed by a desktop pin. Windows 10 users will need an Android smartphone with Android 7.0 or newer to interface with the Your Phone app and are required to download a Microsoft mobile app to set up the connection. iPhone users can also use the Your Phone app to share web pages seamlessly between their mobile device and their Windows 10 PC. The Your Phone app and features are available for Windows 10 Insiders in the Fast ring.
