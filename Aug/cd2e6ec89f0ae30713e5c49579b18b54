Microsoft is making its Your Phone app available to all Windows 10 users through the Microsoft Store. The company recently rolled out the tool to Windows 10 Insiders, allowing them to link their Android smartphones to their Windows 10 PC and share data across the devices. The application syncs the most recent photos on the userâ€™s Android device to their PC automatically, for example, and the smartphone sharing interface can be accessed by a desktop pin. Your Phone requires users to install the Microsoft Apps application on their Android smartphone to link their device to their PC, added Microsoft. Windows 10 users will also need to have Android 7.0 or newer installed on their smartphone, while iPhones are not currently supported. Microsoft said it plans to add notification and text message synchronisation to the tool in the future.
