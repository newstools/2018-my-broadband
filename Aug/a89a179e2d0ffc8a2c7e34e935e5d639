MWEB is increasing the price of its ADSL and fibre products on 1 September 2018. The company informed subscribers about the price increase this week, explaining that it was necessary due to rising operational costs. MWEB told subscribers that the price increase will automatically be applied to their next bill. The price increase only affects the data portion of MWEB’s product, and the price of DSL and fibre lines will remain unchanged. The exact details of the price increases remain unknown, but many MWEB subscribers informed MyBroadband that their products increased by R20 per month. MWEB’s help desk told MyBroadband that the price increases range between R10 and R30 per month. “MWEB has informed customers that the prices of their ADSL, fibre, and some VAS products will increase on 1 September,” said the company. “These increases are due to operational costs. At the time of the VAT increase, MWEB did not increase prices in line with market increases, as we believed we could keep the rising operational costs at bay. Sadly, we have not been able to do this.” “This increase will be effective from 1 August 2018 for new customers, and will be implemented from 1 September 2018 for existing customers.”
