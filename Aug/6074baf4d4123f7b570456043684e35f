Facebook has discovered a coordinated attempt to influence the political landscape in the US ahead of the midterm elections. It removed 32 pages and accounts from Facebook and Instagram because they were involved in “coordinated inauthentic behaviour,” the company said in a statement. “This kind of behaviour is not allowed on Facebook because we don’t want people or organisations creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they are, or what they’re doing.” The company said it is still in the early stages of its investigation and does not have all the facts, including who may be behind the campaign. “We are sharing what we know today given the connection between these bad actors and protests that are planned in Washington next week,” said Facebook. “We will update this post with more details when we have them, or if the facts we have change.”
