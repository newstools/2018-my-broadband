Huawei overtook Apple to claim second spot in the global smartphone shipment rankings this week. Huawei shipped 54.2 million phones in Q2 2018, a 41% year-on-year increase, which gave it a 16% share of the market. Apple secured 12% market share for the period, while Samsung was in first place with 21%. The other top brands trailing the big three included Xiaomi and Oppo – both Chinese companies. It is not only in the global rankings where Huawei is growing its presence, and the company has targeted South Africa as a key market for growth. Huawei South Africa told MyBroadband that, as is the case with global trends, its performance in South Africa is on the up. The company said it currently occupies the number two spot in South Africa when it comes to smartphone market share. As of June 2018, Huawei had 14.5% South African market share, compared to Apple’s 4%. “Huawei’s success is attributed to providing great value in the mid-to-high-end segment, which finds us gaining ground on all major competitors. We will continue to drive the high-end brand strategy,” said Huawei South Africa. The company’s statement follows a busy year so far for it, which included the launch of its flagship P20 range. The Huawei P20 range is performing well locally, said the company, and the popularity of its devices – along with a drive to offer the best customer service in South Africa – will see it continue to gain ground on its main competitor, Samsung. Huawei also recently announced that is was building a new smartphone warehouse in South Africa, which would decrease the time it takes to get new smartphones to stores and customers. Huawei told MyBroadband it currently ships smartphones and other devices to customers directly from its warehouses in China. This process can take weeks and in some cases can lead to serious local stock shortages.
