Government agencies in the United States will be banned from using components and services from a number of Chinese companies, including Huawei and ZTE. President Donald Trump signed the ban into law as part of the Defense Authorization Act, covering any technology that constitutes a substantial or essential part of any government system. The ban also covers telecommunications technology used to route or view user data. Under the Act, United States agencies affected by the ban are directed to allocate funding to companies to replace any technology which is no longer allowed to be included in their systems. The US government also recently cracked down on ZTE, banning its ability to purchase US technology until it met a number of conditions. The Chinese technology company has resumed business with US suppliers following the payment of a large fine and various organisational changes.
