Harman Kardon has unveiled its new smart speaker powered by Google Assistant, The Verge reported. The speaker is named the Citation 500 and will be available for pre-order in Europe in September 2018. The device is priced at £549 and boasts 200W stereo speakers which support 24-bit/96KHz high-definition audio streaming. An LCD touch panel with playback controls is placed at the top of the speaker, allowing users to manually change songs or control media volume without using voice commands. Harman Kardon’s Citation 500 sports a fabric-covered design similar to Google’s smart speakers and will be available in black and grey options. Thanks to its Google Assistant support, the Citation 500 allows users to control playback via voice commands and use the device as a smart home hub for other connected devices.
