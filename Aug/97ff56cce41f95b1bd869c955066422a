YouTube has launched an addition to user profiles which show how much video you’ve watched on the platform. The new feature is part of Google’s “Digital Wellbeing” initiative unveiled at Google I/O in May 2018, said the company. “Our goal is to provide a better understanding of time spent on YouTube,” said Google. Your profile on YouTube will now show how much video you’ve watched today, yesterday, and over the past week. This is available from the account menu. You can also set the YouTube app to remind you to take a break from watching after you’ve spent a certain amount of time using the platform. It also allows you to limit the number of notifications you receive from YouTube, setting a specific time to receive a daily digest that bundles all the notifications. The new Digital Wellbeing features for YouTube started rolling out today.
