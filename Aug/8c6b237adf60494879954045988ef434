MTN has announced it will launch a new fibre-to-the-home brand with a number of new fibre products. According to a launch event invite for the end of August 2018, the brand is named Supersonic and aims to deliver simple and customisable products to MTN fibre customers. “It’s fibre that’s super simple to understand and customisable enough to create a connection to the Internet that makes sense for your needs. It’s Internet as it should be,” said MTN. “No nonsense – we don’t deal in confusing jargon and complicated tech-talk. We don’t deal in extended contracts and we don’t deal in time lags,” the company added. MTN said its Supersonic packages would come with full installation, device setup, on-site technical support, and a dedicated relationship manager for telephonic support. The company said its fibre features can also be customised via a smartphone app. MTN was asked for further comment on the matter, but did not reply to questions.
