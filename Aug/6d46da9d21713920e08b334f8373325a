Google has announced an experimental feature for Assistant which may be invoked with the command “Hey Google, tell me something good”. Currently in testing in the US, the Google Assistant will respond with a brief news summary about people who are solving problems. The stories will come from a range of media outlets, curated and summarised by the Solutions Journalism Network. This is a non-partisan, non-profit organisation which aims to spread the practice of “solutions journalism” – which highlights how problems in the world are solvable and that doing better is possible. “Solutions journalism empowers and energises audiences, helping to combat negative news fatigue,” said Google. “It’s an important part of a balanced news diet, so we’re exploring how to incorporate more solutions journalism wherever you access Google News.” “It’s an experiment worth trying, because it’s good info about good work that may bring some good to your day,” added Google. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
