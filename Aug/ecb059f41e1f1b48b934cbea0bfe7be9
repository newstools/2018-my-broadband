Apple has removed thousands of illegal apps from its App Store in China, the Wall Street Journal reported. This is after the company drew criticism from state media in China for not doing more to deal with apps for services that are illegal in the country – such as gambling. The Global Times in China also reported that Apple removed over 2,000 apps related to gambling in one day – on 9 August 2018. This followed a report from CCTV in July which stated that the illegal applications in Apple’s App Store had caused people to lose money. In a statement, Apple said: “Gambling apps are illegal and not allowed on the App Store in China. We have already removed many apps and developers for trying to distribute illegal gambling apps on our App Store.”
