Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated on Twitter that the company will add a number of classic Atari games to the software in its electric cars. The games will be available as Easter Eggs in Tesla’s V9.0 operating system, which is set to release in around a month. Musk also stated that Tesla was hiring video game developers to build games which integrate with the Tesla’s touchscreen, the driver’s smartphone, and the car itself. This means Tesla owners will be able to play classic games such as Pole Position using the vehicle’s physical steering wheel as a controller. Tesla is also adding a number of other fun features to its vehicles, including “party” and “camper” modes for its Model S, 3, and X vehicles. These modes will allow the vehicle to power devices, play music, and maintain air flow and temperature for extended amounts of time while parked. Some of best classic @Atari games coming as Easter eggs in Tesla V9.0 release in about 4 weeks. Thanks @Atari! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 1, 2018
