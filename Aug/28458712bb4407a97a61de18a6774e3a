MyBroadband’s Speed Test App is used by thousands of South Africans to test the performance of their mobile network. MyBroadband’s Speed Test platform was developed specifically for South Africa, and all tests are done to independent servers hosted at Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to the MyBroadband Speed Test platform. Data from these speed tests are used to provide an accurate view of the performance of local networks, including Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, Telkom, and Rain. By running a speed test you stand a chance to win R10,000 in cash and other prizes. Here’s what you should do: Please note that mobile data used for speed tests on your mobile network will count towards your monthly usage allowance, and these speed tests can use a lot of data when testing a high-speed network. Good news is that MTN has zero-rated the MyBroadband Speed Test App, which means MTN subscribers will not be charged for the data used when running speed tests. The giveaway winners will be selected and announced on 7 September 2018.
