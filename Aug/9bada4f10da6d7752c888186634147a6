South African motorists should expect fuel prices to stay flat in September 2018, according to data published by the CEF, reported BusinessTech. According to the data, fuel prices are expected to remain flat for 93 petrol and diesel, due to the falling rand negating any effects from positive movements in global fuel prices. The CEF stated that 95 petrol is expected to increase by around two cents per litre in the middle of the month, and illuminating paraffin should decrease by six cents per litre. The randâ€™s crash on Monday has had the biggest impact on fuel prices so far, according to the daily price movements tracked. This prediction follows five consecutive months of petrol price increases in South Africa, putting added strain on local motorists. The expected fuel prices for September 2018 are below.
