Facebook has banned the sale of piracy-enabling streaming devices, including all devices that use Kodi software. According to a report by TorrentFreak, however, the policy will affect legal streaming boxes that have Kodi software installed. “While Kodi itself is a neutral platform, third-party add-ons can turn it into a powerful pirate tool. This is why Kodi and piracy are often mentioned in the same breath,” stated the report. Facebook stated that users can no longer promote “the sale or use of streaming devices with Kodi installed”. The new policy comes after multiple incidents involving “fully-loaded” Kodi boxes making the news – including in May 2018 when a Welsh court sentenced two people to jail for selling media players which enabled pirate streams.
