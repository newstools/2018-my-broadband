Nokia recently announced that it will charge a €3 licensing fee per device for its essential patents on the 5G standard, AppleInsider reported. It followed Ericsson and Qualcomm, which have also announced their fee structures. According to the report, Ericsson will charge on a sliding scale between $2.50 and $5, based on the cost of the device. Qualcomm said it will charge a percentage of a device’s total price, to a maximum price of $400 – 2.275% for a single mode device and 3.25% for multi-mode phones. This means that smartphone manufacturers will pay at least $21 in licensing fees on their high-end phones, of which around $13 will go to Qualcomm, stated the report. Apple Insider noted that all holders of standards-essential patents for 5G have not yet announced their fees, Huawei among them. It also highlighted that high volume deals may help reduce the final figure.
