Intel has released the world’s densest SSD, which is aimed at data centres. The ruler-shaped Intel SSD DC P4500 boasts 32TB of storage space and draws one-tenth the power of a traditional spinning hard drive. “Intel’s newest solid state drive is about the size of an old-fashioned 12-inch ruler. It is Intel’s densest drive ever,” said Intel. It is built on Intel 3D NAND technology, which stacks memory cells “atop each other in multiple extremely thin layers”. Memory cells in the P4500 are stacked 64 layers deep. “In data centres, the SSDs can be lined up 32 side-by-side, to hold up to a petabyte in a single server slot.”
