Huawei is testing its GPU Turbo technology in South Africa before rolling out the software update to consumer devices. GPU Turbo is a Huawei-developed technology which will increase the performance of the company’s smartphones in gaming and graphics-intensive applications – and will be delivered to compatible devices via a software update. Huawei said GPU Turbo will deliver a massive performance improvement – up to 60% on some devices – while reducing overall power consumption of the device’s chipset by 30%. Huawei smartphone owners who receive the update should therefore have longer battery life when playing games or using video-intensive applications, in addition to a performance boost. Mobile gaming is a growing market worldwide, especially in China, where Huawei’s GPU Turbo update has already rolled out to customers. GPU Turbo will also improve performance across the operating system of compatible devices, added Huawei. Speaking at a media briefing in Sandton, Johannesburg, Huawei South Africa general manager Likun Zhao detailed the local release information for GPU Turbo. Zhao said that 100 million Huawei smartphone owners around the world would see a performance boost thanks to the technology. “This is the first time a smartphone vendor has developed software technology to increase hardware performance significantly for gaming,” said Zhao. “We are testing the software enhancements before launching them in South Africa.” A number of devices will receive the GPU Turbo update in South Africa, from Huawei’s high-end flagship range to its mid-range smartphones. Zhao said that all new P and Mate devices would receive the technology, but the release schedule will be staggered. This is detailed for South Africa, below.
