BCX Chief Financial Officer Refilwe Nkabinde has resigned, according to an email sent from CEO Jonas Bogoshi which MyBroadband has seen. Bogoshi stated that Nkabinde will leave BCX at the end of August 2018. “I would like to thank Refilwe for her commitment and dedication to our business during her tenure. I’m sure you will join me in wishing Refilwe all the best for her future ventures,” said Bogoshi. “Refilwe will be replaced by Zweli Vilakazi, who will be seconded to BCX from the Telkom Group.” Nkabinde’s resignation follows the resignation of BCX COO Mike Buttner two weeks ago, and the resignation of BCX CEO Ian Russell in June 2018.
