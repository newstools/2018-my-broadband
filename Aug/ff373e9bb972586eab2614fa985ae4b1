The inventor of BitTorrent, Bram Cohen, has left the company he founded, TorrentFreak reported. BitTorrent, which is also the name of the P2P protocol Cohen developed, was recently acquired by cryptocurrency startup Tron. Tron plans to roll out a system of cryptocurrency rewards for people who seed torrents. “At this point, there are no incentives for peers who have completed downloading to continue to seed,” said Tron founder Justin Sun. Cohen stated he has no involvement with Tron, and confirmed to TorrentFreak he is no longer with BitTorrent Inc. TorrentFreak noted that Cohen is also working on his own cryptocurrency project called Chia. Chia uses a consensus algorithm known as proof-of-space, and aims to be more environmentally friendly than proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin. Chia also promises to be more decentralised, and more secure than other cryptocurrencies.
