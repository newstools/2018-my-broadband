Netflix has revealed its ISP Speed Index for July 2018, with Cool Ideas retaining the top spot. South Africa’s ISPs achieved an average speed of 2.48Mbps, a slight decrease compared to last month, although the country held onto its overall rank of 50 out of 59 countries. The index is a measure of prime-time Netflix performance on particular ISPs, and not a measure of overall performance of the networks. Netflix said it calculates the average bitrate of Netflix content, in Mbps, streamed by its members per ISP. “We measure the speed via all available end-user devices. For a small number of devices, we cannot calculate the exact bit rates, and streaming via cellular networks is exempted from our measurements,” said Netflix. Netflix recommends a 5Mbps connection for full HD streaming, which may explain why the average speeds are all below the 5Mbps mark. The fastest 10 ISPs for prime-time Netflix streaming in South Africa are listed below.
