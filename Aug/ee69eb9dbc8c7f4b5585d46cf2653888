Intel has unveiled new additions to its 8th-gen Intel Core processor family. The U-series (Whiskey Lake) and Y-series (Amber Lake) processors are made for use in light laptops and 2-in-1 devices, providing “ultimate mobile performance and long battery life”. The U-series also features support for Gigabit Wi-Fi, while the Y-series processors deliver fast Wi-Fi and LTE capabilities. “Both the U-series and Y-series processors have new and improved platform capabilities for more intelligent interactions with PCs, such as support for multiple voice services on the U-series and refinements to improve natural input options like touch and stylus for the Y-series,” said Intel. The company stated that laptops and 2-in-1 devices powered by the new 8th-gen Intel Core U-series and Y-series processors will be available before the end of 2018.
