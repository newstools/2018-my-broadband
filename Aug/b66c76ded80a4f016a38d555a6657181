Afrihost is expanding its fixed-wireless connectivity options with the launch of Cell C fixed-LTE packages. “Afrihost now offers more extensive coverage and an additional range of products – at affordable prices – to give clients more choice than ever before. With speeds up to 69Mbps, it’s an easy and convenient solution from as little as R4.23 per GB,” said Afrihost. The Cell C packages follow Afrihost launching Rain fixed-LTE packages – which have proved popular in South Africa. Afrihost added that clients who sign up for a new package can choose one of three promotions. “They can elect to take a free Huawei B315 Wi-Fi device, or pay just R999 for a Huawei B618 Wi-Fi device. Clients can also elect to take a SIM-only option and get their activation month free.” Clients can purchase data top-ups if needed at R12.50 per GB, said Afrihost. The Cell C fixed-LTE packages from Afrihost are detailed below.
