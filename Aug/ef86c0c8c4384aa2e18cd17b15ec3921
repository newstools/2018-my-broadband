Samsung has received HDR10+ certification for its 2018 range of Premium UHD and QLED TVs. HDR10+ technology helps TVs optimise brightness levels in a scene by incorporating dynamic metadata. With HDR10+, Samsung TVs can produce brighter highlights and darker darks for additional depth and a sense of realism. “The HDR10+ certification programme creates a foundation that provides viewers with an enhanced viewing experience while also developing a range of plans to extend the HDR10+ ecosystem,” said Samsung. Samsung said that among its notable HDR10+ partnerships is one with TP Vision, which oversees TV development, manufacturing, and marketing for Philips. “Film production company Warner Bros. will also start creating HDR10+ content, which will be available for home distribution later this year,” said Samsung . The company added that it has also partnered with Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation to standardise the HDR10+ licensing process.
