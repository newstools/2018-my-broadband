Instagram now allows users to send polls to others through direct messages on its platform. The new feature works similarly to adding the poll sticker to stories, but users will be able to select the users who receive the story. This creates a group chat in which invited participants can vote and view the poll results in real time. Instagram rolled out its poll sticker in October 2017 and has since launched a number of new features to enhance its Stories tool. The platform’s recent enhancements include question stickers, soundtracks, and an emoji slider, which can all be included in a user’s Instagram story. Sending polls via direct message is available for Android and iOS devices. Starting today, you can send a poll privately in Direct. Update your app to choose who you want to poll – whether it’s everyone in a big group thread or just your very best friend. Update your app now to try it! pic.twitter.com/Lfr6pwPDzI — Instagram (@instagram) August 14, 2018
