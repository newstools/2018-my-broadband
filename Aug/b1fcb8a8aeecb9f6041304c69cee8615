Dell has unveiled new 24-inch and 27-inch PC gaming monitors. The Dell Gaming displays feature AMD FreeSync, high refresh rates and resolutions, and low response times. “Users can customise up to three user-defined profiles and choose preset modes for the best personalised gaming experience,” said Dell. “The gamer-inspired Recon-Blue metallic paint complements Dell gaming PCs for a unified look and gaming experience. During the warranty period, Dell Premium Panel Exchange allows a free panel replacement even if only one bright pixel is found,” added the company. The Dell Gaming 24 and 27 monitors will be available in the US from 28 August 2018, at $319 for the 24-inch and $549 for the 27-inch.
