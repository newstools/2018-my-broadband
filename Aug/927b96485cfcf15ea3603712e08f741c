MultiChoice has launched three new apps for DStv Now. DStv Now apps for Samsung smart TVs, Apple TV, and Android TV media players are now available, said the company. MultiChoice stated that certain Samsung smart TV models from 2015 onwards would be supported, along with Apple TV 4th-gen and up, and Google-certified media players running Android. “These apps make it possible for DStv subscribers to turn any TV in their house into an easy-to-use DStv hub, without the need for a decoder,” said MultiChoice. “Apps are also expected to be added for additional brands of smart TVs,” added the company. Mark Rayner, MultiChoice South Africa Chief Operating Officer, said that by adding these apps they have made it easier for viewers to enjoy DStv’s channels via the streaming platform.
