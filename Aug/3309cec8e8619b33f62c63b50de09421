Tesla Inc. co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk sent a tweet on Sunday linking a parodied version of “Downfall,” a movie on Adolf Hitler’s last days, talking about shorting Tesla stock. “Dang, turns out even Hitler was shorting Tesla stock …” Musk posted to Twitter. The YouTube video shows a popular movie clip, often parodied on the internet with captions on different subjects, of Hitler yelling in his bunker. Hitler, in the Tesla parody, gets angry at Tesla Model 3 demand going “through the roof” and second-quarter results sending the stock “soaring.” In the original movie, Hitler is seen discussing war tactics with his generals before realising that the end is near. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
