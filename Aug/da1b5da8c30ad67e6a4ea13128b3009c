Stratolaunch has announced plans to develop its own launch vehicles, deployed from its giant twin-fuselage aircraft. The aircraft acts as a flying launchpad for rockets, reducing the amount of energy required for rockets to launch into orbit by deploying them at high altitude. Stratolaunch previously planned to use its aircraft to launch rockets from other companies, but has now said it will build its own rockets. This will include a new Medium Launch Vehicle (MLV), which will be optimised for affordable and flexible launches, and an MLV Heavy rocket with a payload capacity of 6,000kg. Stratolaunch also plans to develop a reusable space plane which will be capable of orbital return missions, one variant of which will be able to support manned orbital missions. “We are excited to share for the first time some details about the development of our own, proprietary Stratolaunch launch vehicles, with which we will offer a flexible launch capability unlike any other,” said Stratolaunch CEO Jean Floyd. “Whatever the payload, whatever the orbit, getting your satellite into space will soon be as easy as booking an airline flight.”
