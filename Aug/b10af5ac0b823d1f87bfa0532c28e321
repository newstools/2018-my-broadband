ICASA is calling for comments on its new draft Call Termination Rates. The draft was published on 16 August 2018, and the deadline for submission of written comments is 7 September 2018. “The effective date of the regulations, once finalised, will be 1 October 2018,” said ICASA. “Since 2010, the termination rates have been reduced by approximately 90% and this has contributed to the significant decline in retail rates over the years,” it added. The draft regulations propose a number of amendments, as detailed below.
