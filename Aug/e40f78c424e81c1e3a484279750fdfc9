Google may launch “Google Coach” – a Wear OS-based AI assistant that would help users improve their fitness and health. According to a report by Android Police, Google is developing the Coach system to provide users with more than just feedback on their workouts. It would suggest changes in exercises and activity, including new routines or alternative workouts if you are running late to the gym, for example. The report further stated that meal plans and shopping lists would also be taken care of by the AI coach. This will sit on top of basic reminders like “drink more water” and daily step count goals. Initially, Google Coach will be aimed at Wear OS smartwatches, stated the report. No details on a rollout plan were reported.
