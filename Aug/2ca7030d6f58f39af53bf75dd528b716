The rise of streaming services has made it easier than ever to view high-quality content. However, making use of popular platforms like DStv Now, Netflix, Showmax, and Black requires supported hardware. While many smart TVs support Google Cast and platform apps, PC web browsers, iOS handsets, and Android devices are usually first in line to receive support from big companies. This means that if you don’t have the latest smart TV from a big brand, you may not receive native support on your living room display for streaming services. An answer to this problem is an Android media box, a dedicated piece of hardware which connects to the Internet and your TV, and runs the Google operating system. Many of these devices are not Google-certified, however, which means that certain applications may not be supported – including DStv Now. Google-certified devices offer support for all official apps as well as official versions of the Android TV OS. They also provide great performance for their size and price, and many Google-certified Android TV boxes in South Africa feature similar hardware – namely the Amlogic S905X chipset. This chip allows for 4K video support at 60 frames per second, and HDR. If you are looking to upgrade your home entertainment experience and have a set budget, a Google-certified Android TV box may be a good choice. Devices available in South Africa can be purchased for around R1,000, with examples of Google-certified options listed below.
