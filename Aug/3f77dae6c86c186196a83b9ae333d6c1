Amazon has launch its Route 53 DNS web service in both of its edge locations in South Africa, improving availability and performance for local customers. The company’s two edge locations are in Johannesburg and Cape Town, and recently started delivering Amazon’s CloudFront global content delivery service (CDN). Route 53 aims to offer developers and businesses a reliable and cost-effective way to route end-users to Internet applications and can also be used to create an Alias record for customers which points to their CloudFront distribution. “For a variety of media applications, Amazon CloudFront allows customers to stream audio and video to viewers across the globe using multiple protocols,” said Amazon. “The Route 53 addition makes it even easier for our customers to manage traffic globally through a variety of routing types.” Route 53 is designed to automatically answer queries from the optimal location, depending on network conditions, offering low query latency for end users. “Combined with the launch of Direct Connect in December 2017, AWS is now offering a full range of networking and caching solutions to businesses in South Africa.”
