The NAG LAN will return to the rAge expo in October 2018, with gamers bringing their rigs to the weekend-long event. The LAN is the largest BYOC (Bring Your Own Computer) LAN in South Africa, and sees thousands of attendees competing in tournaments and meeting up to play with friends. Perks of the 52-hour LAN event include high-speed uncapped Internet, complimentary access to the rAge expo, and the opportunity to prove your worth against other gamers in public esports competitions. The rAge team has made a number of improvements to the LAN this year, with gamers now able to select seating areas for the first time. “For the first time ever, gamers will be able to pre-select their preferred experience in three dedicated LAN areas when purchasing their tickets,” said rAge owner Michael James. Some of these areas will be fully carpeted, others will be more secluded from the expo floor, and each will feature all the amenities NAG LAN attendees are accustomed to. Additionally, gamers attending the LAN will be able to sleep beneath their tables again – following many attendees complaining of leaving their gaming rigs alone to sleep in a bed. Perhaps the most important change, however, is the improvement of the NAG LAN chairs in one of the seating areas. James said that one of the three dedicated LAN areas would feature new padded chairs, instead of the standard plastic variety seen in years past. When you’re sitting and playing games for 52 hours straight, a nicely-padded chair can make a major difference to your gaming experience. The new padded chair is pictured below.  It is important to note that these chairs are only available in the NAG LAN Banqueting area, situated one level below the show floor. Tickets for the NAG LAN at rAge 2018 are already sold out, so consider yourself lucky if you managed to grab a ticket in the Banqueting section. The NAG LAN will take place at the rAge expo at the Ticketpro Dome in Northgate from 5-7 October 2018.
