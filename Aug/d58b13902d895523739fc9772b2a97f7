Samsung has unveiled the Galaxy Note 9 at a special event in New York – calling it the world’s most advanced smartphone. The company said the Galaxy Note 9 was aimed at a new generation of users and creators – and packs a 6.4-inch display and a 4,000mAh battery. “The device also features generous built-in storage options – either 128GB or 512GB – that allow users to put the days of deleting photos, videos, and apps to make room for more behind them,” said Samsung.
