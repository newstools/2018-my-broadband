Vox has selected Teraco’s Riverfields Hyperscale data centre facility to meet its requirement for an additional local in Gauteng from which to provide services. It stated that provisioning of routing, switching, compute, storage, and associated redundant fibre infrastructure had been completed, with colocation and cloud services now in full production. “The Riverfields facility forms part of the Vox strategy for geo-redundant services for carrier, voice, and cloud customers,” said Keith Laaks, Vox Executive Head: Core. “Vox will deliver open peering as per our policy at the Riverfields location, in addition to NAPAfrica peering. Migration of colocation customers from our Waverley data centre to Riverfields is progressing well,” added Laaks. Laaks said they will shut down the Vox-operated Waverley data centre in November 2018 as a result, after opting to outsource data centre facilities management.
