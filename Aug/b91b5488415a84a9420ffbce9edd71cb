Valve has accidentally revealed it is working on a streaming platform which will compete with services like Twitch, CNET reported. The company has registered a new domain called Steam.tv, and the website was accidentally made public as Valve tested the service. While the website was live, users were able to log in with their Steam accounts and view games from the Dota 2 International. From this platform, users could also access their Steam friends lists and chats and voice chat with others. Speaking to CNET, Valve confirmed it was working on the broadcasting service ahead of the Dota 2 main event. “We are working on updating Steam Broadcasting for the main event of The International,” Valve told CNET. “What people saw was a test feed that was inadvertently made public.”
