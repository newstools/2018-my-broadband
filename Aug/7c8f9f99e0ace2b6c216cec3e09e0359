Netflix has reportedly started distancing itself from the term “binge watching”, due to its negative health connotations. In a report from Engadget, it was stated that during an interview with Guy Pearce, the actor said Netflix does not like the term “binge” or its use. His statement was in reply to a question about the Netflix show The Innocents being “binge-worthy”. The report comes at a time when companies like Google are putting new features into their software and platforms to ensure users can track how much time they spend online and on their devices. The latest move from Google is “Digital Wellbeing” functionality in YouTube, which lets users track how many hours of videos they have watched.
