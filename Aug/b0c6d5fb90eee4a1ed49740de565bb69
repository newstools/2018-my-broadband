Slack developer Felix Rieseberg has released an app which lets users run Window 95 on their macOS, Windows, and Linux PCs. Available on GitHub, the app’s source code and installers are free to download – with the app featuring the likes of Wordpad, phone dialer, MS Paint, and Minesweeper. Internet Explorer isn’t fully functional and does not load pages, however, reported The Verge. The app is 129MB in size, stated the report, and only uses 200MB of RAM when running. Users are also able to reset the Windows 95 instance if they encounter any problems when running it.
