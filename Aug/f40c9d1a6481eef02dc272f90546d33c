Naspers has created a new video entertainment unit, which will be headed up by Niclas Ekdahl as CEO from 10 September 2018. The Connected Video unit will run the Showmax and DStv Now services in South Africa. It will also be responsible for developing new over-the-top services for the MultiChoice group. “Niclas has over 19 years of executive leadership experience in the audio visual services industry. This includes heading up the pay-TV channel division for Viasat Broadcasting in London and leading OTT and VOD service in the Nordic region as CEO of Viaplay,” said MultiChoice. “Most recently, Niclas was managing director for Nuvu – a VOD service launched by Ericsson in 2015.” MultiChoice said video services are growing rapidly across Africa and it has made a healthy start preparing for this future with Showmax and DStv Now. “It’s now time to consolidate those learnings in a single unit to build the best possible services for our customers. Niclas has the right experience to make this happen and we’re thrilled to have him on board,” said Imtiaz Patel, CEO of Naspers’ Video Entertainment business.
