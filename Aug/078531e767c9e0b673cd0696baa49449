Skype has launched end-to-end encryption for text chats, enabling its Private Conversations feature across the platform. Private Conversations uses the Signal Protocol from Open Whisper Systems, the company Facebook used to implement end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp. Open Whisper Systems also offers its own secure instant messaging application, called Signal. Microsoft announced in January that it was rolling out Private Conversations in Skype, but until the most recent update, the feature wasÂ only available in preview for Skype Insiders. End-to-end encryption in Skype is now available through its iOS, Android, Linux, Mac, and Windows desktop applications.
