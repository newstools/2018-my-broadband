Google has made its Titan Security Key available to customers via the Google Store. The full Titan kit includes a USB key, Bluetooth key, and charging connectors – and is priced at $50. These security keys can be used to add a layer of hardware security to your Google account by enabling two-factor authentication and selecting the hardware security key authentication method. Both of the Titan models are FIDO-compatible and can be used across any service which supports hardware key two-factor authentication. The Bluetooth version of the Titan Security Key supports both mobile and desktop devices, while the other plugs into a USB port on desktop or laptop devices. Google’s online store is not yet available in South Africa, but users in supported countries can order the new Titan Security Key kit from today.
