The AA has stated that South Africans can expect a big petrol price increase in the coming month. “More fuel price hikes are on their way courtesy of a weaker rand,” said the AA. The price hike prediction is based on unaudited month-end fuel price data supplied by the Central Energy Fund. “International petroleum prices remained virtually unchanged on average during August, but the rand lost substantial ground against the US dollar, increasing the landed price of fuels.” “This will, for the first time, push the cost of 93 unleaded octane fuel inland above the R16-a-litre mark, a significant barrier,” added the AA.
