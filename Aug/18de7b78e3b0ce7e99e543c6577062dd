Nvidia has published a teaser video for its new range of gaming graphics cards, suggesting they will be unveiled next week. This follows the GPU maker’s recent launch of its first Turing architecture-based cards, the Quadro RTX series. The new cards boast ray tracing cores for improved real-time ray tracing, along with GDDR6 VRAM. First spotted by users on Reddit, Nvidia’s teaser video hints at the name of the new graphics cards. The Discord user names and messages featured in the video spell out the name “RTX 2080”, pointing at a departure from the traditional “GTX” branding. However, the new graphics cards could also be placed as a complementary product line-up to the existing GTX 10-series – with Nvidia continuing to release standard GTX-branded products. Nvidia’s Gamescom event in Cologne on 20 August 2018 is set to be the stage for more details. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
