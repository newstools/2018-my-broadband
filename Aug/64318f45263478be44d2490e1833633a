Knowledge is one of the most valuable assets anyone can ever own. It can never be lost, stolen or taken away. As a result of technology, the way in which people obtain knowledge is changing too. Individuals are no longer restricted to physical lectures and textbooks, but are able to gain access to information, training, and soft skills development in digital formats anywhere, and at any time, via eLearning. With 3.5-billion people using mobile devices to access the internet, mobile learning is rapidly becoming the norm, and MWare’s newly launched mobile learning app, mLearning, is leading the way. mLearning is an extremely flexible platform that can be adapted and customised for public or private use. Through the mLearning App, companies’ HR departments have a convenient platform on which to upload their own corporate training material, thereby providing employees with soft skills development without needing to invest in any additional resources.  “Mobile learning is particularly prevalent in South African terms,” says MWare CEO Mich Martins. “Not only because such a small percentage of our matrics gain exemption or have the means to further their studies, but also because skills development is the only way in which any person can earn more and improve their and their families’ quality of life. “Studies have also shown that a company that invests in its staff, is more likely to keep them, which is why we are seeing a massive shift towards online skills development internationally. This is something that is catching on quickly in South Africa as well,” Martins adds. MWare is an automated business solutions company specialising in powerful and flexible mobile platforms such as the Sage 300 Toolkit and MobiWork Mobile Workforce Solutions.
