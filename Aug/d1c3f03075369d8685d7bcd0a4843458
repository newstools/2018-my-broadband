Cattle intended for poor farmers was sent to Jacob Zuma, according to a report by the Sunday Times. The cows were purchased with public money and meant to benefit emerging Eastern Cape farmers, added the report. However, these cows were reportedly diverted to Zuma, ANC politicians, and Eastern Cape royalty. The report stated that former OR Tambo district municipality mayor Zoleka Capa revealed the diversions when she admitted to giving cattle to Zuma. The cattle were purchased in 2008 “as part of an upliftment plan by the OR Tambo municipality”. This included spending R62 million on seven farms near Kokstad, and R30 million on 1,800 cows and equipment. “It was estimated that the herd would increase to 10,000 within 10 years. Instead, the cattle were distributed to councillors and politicians,” stated the report. Sources told the publication that 50 cows were sent to Nkandla, while more cows were sent to Willowvale for Zuma to “hand out to kings”. The Sunday Times reported in April 2018 that Zuma was also given cattle worth R1.5 million by former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo in 2016. These cows were also paid for with public money. Zuma has faced an array of charges and accusations during his time as president, including using public money for massive “security upgrades” to his Nkandla homestead. It was recently reported that Zuma may have his Nkandla home taken away as part of a corruption case he faces. Earlier in 2018, it was also reported that Zuma received a cash bribe of R1 million from an abalone dealer to keep a minister in his job. The report stated that Zuma was being investigated by the Hawks at the time over this allegation. Zuma’s relationship with the Gupta family was another point of contention during his presidency, with the Guptas accused of state capture and using state enterprises to enrich themselves.
