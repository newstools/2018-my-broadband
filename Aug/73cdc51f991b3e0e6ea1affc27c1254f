YouTube has announced that it will start rolling out non-skippable advert options to all channels which monetise their videos. For users, this means you are very likely to come across more adverts which cannot be skipped so you can watch the content you have selected. As detailed in YouTube’s Creator Insider video below, this will give creators in the YouTube Partner Program the option to make more revenue. In terms of the length of these adverts, Google’s help page on YouTube adverts currently states that the maximum length for non-skippable adverts is 15-20 seconds – depending which region you are in. This is still longer than the typical 5-second “mandatory watch” period of skippable adverts, however, which many users are accustomed to seeing. Engadget noted that when creators get access to the feature, it will be auto-activated for previous uploads, too – which means older videos will also receive the unskippable adverts. “They’ll also be given access to tools that can track their non-skippable ads’ performance. If they notice a decline in viewership or earnings, they can always deactivate it for all their videos in settings,” stated the report. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
