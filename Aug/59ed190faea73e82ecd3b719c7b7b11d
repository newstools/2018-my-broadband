Linus Torvalds has started the development cycle of the Linux 4.19 kernel series, reported Softpedia News. Torvalds has published the first Release Candidate for Linux 4.19, two weeks after the Linux 4.18 kernel series was launched. “So two weeks have passed, and the merge window for 4.19 is over. This was a fairly frustrating merge window, partly because 4.19 looks to be a pretty big release, and partly just due to random noise,” said Torvalds. The report stated that Linux 4.19 will bring many changes with it, including updated graphics and networking drivers, core kernel and networking improvements, and updated filesystems. Linux 4.19 is predicted to arrive in the middle of October 2018. The Release Candidate, which will let users test Linux 4.19, is available via kernel.org.
