Samsung recently launched its new range of QLED TVs in South Africa, offering UHD resolutions, HDR10+ support, full-array backlighting, and an automatic game mode. Samsung has received HDR10+ certification for its full 2018 range of Premium UHD and QLED TVs, which will optimise brightness levels in a scene by incorporating dynamic metadata. With HDR10+, Samsung TVs can also produce brighter highlights and darker darks – providing additional depth and a sense of realism to movies and series. These features coupled with the excellent quality of Samsung TVs are core to Samsung earning the status of number one global brand in terms of sales for 12 consecutive years. The company’s TVs, available in an array of sizes, allow users to pick the perfect display for their needs and has seen customers continuing to pick Samsung as their first TV choice.  Another contributor to Samsung’s strong position in the market is its continuous development of cutting-edge technology and features for its TVs. Samsung is currently working with companies to ensure users have access to great content and features, including a partnership with TP Vision on HDR10+ and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation to standardise the HDR10+ licensing process. Big producers such as Warner Bros. are working on HDR10+ content, too, allowing users to fully enjoy the high-end features of their TV. Amazon has also announced that its Prime Video service will broadcast in HDR10+ on Samsung TVs, with a range of content supporting the standard.
