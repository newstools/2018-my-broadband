Facebook will remove its Friend List Feeds in an effort to improve its News Feed platform, TechCrunch reported. This feature allowed users to view content which only included what their friends were posting, hiding posts from Facebook pages and unfollowed friends. A message posted to the Facebook app stated that Friend List Feeds would no longer be available from 9 August 2018. The company added that users will still be able to create, edit, and share to their friend lists. Facebook told TechCrunch that users can still customise their News Feed using the various options available in the Preferences menu. “[Users] can also keep customising News Feed by visiting News Feed preferences to choose which posts they want to see first, or hide posts they don’t want to see,” said Facebook.
