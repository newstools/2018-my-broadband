CCleaner developer Piriform, which is owned by Avast, has taken down the latest version of its cleaning tool due to privacy concerns expressed by users. Piriform announced it pulled the latest version of CCleaner (v5.45) on the companyâ€™s forums, promising to be more clear regarding the data collected by its software in the future. Users complained of invasive analytics practices, such as issues with turning off active monitoring and the removal of privacy settings from the application. The software also minimised to the system tray when the close button was clicked and there are no options to quit the program, meaning it would run in the background collecting data and reporting to Avast. The company has reverted to CCleaner v5.44 as the main download for the software.
