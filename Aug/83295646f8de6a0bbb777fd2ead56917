Sony has unveiled a new 4K projector, the VPL-VW870ES. The projector is aimed at gamers, sports fans, and movie watchers, and features 4K at 60fps video output. 10-bit colour and HDR capabilities are also included as features of the projector. “The VPL-VW870ES uses an ultra-pure and reliable Z-Phosphor laser light source. This Sony-developed light source offers bright images for up to 20,000 hours of uninterrupted operation – no lamp replacement, and virtually zero maintenance,” said Sony. “You’ll experience fabulously rich cinematic colours, smooth motion and spectacular contrast. Savour the action with 2,200 lumens brightness and see vibrant images,” it added. The projector is expected to launch in November 2018, but no pricing has been announced.
