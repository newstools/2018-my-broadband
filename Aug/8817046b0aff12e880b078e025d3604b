Facebook may be testing a new speech recognition feature called “Aloha”. App investigator Jane Manchun Wong has discovered a new speech recognition feature in the Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps for Android. The “Aloha” feature transcribes voice to text from the app’s user interface, and the tool’s testing code also refers to external Wi-Fi or Bluetooth devices. It is speculated that Facebook may build Aloha to function as a cross-platform digital assistant, similar to Google Assistant or Siri. Wong also found hints that Facebook is working on a smart speaker called Portal. Portal will reportedly pair to a user’s smartphone using either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
