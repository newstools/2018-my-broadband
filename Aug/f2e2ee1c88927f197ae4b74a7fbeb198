Liquid Telecom is exploring partnerships to make the most of its spectrum, and enhance its LTE network and its wireless product offerings. This is according to Liquid Telecom SA CEO Reshaad Sha, who told MyBroadband they are looking at numerous partnership models which make sense for them and their partners. Liquid Telecom has spectrum in the 850MHz, 1.8GHz, and 3.5GHz bands, which are suitable for LTE services. While Sha could not reveal which companies they are discussing potential partnerships with, he said it is likely they will include a mobile operator. This planned partnership model will see a bigger investment into its LTE network, which has not enjoyed much growth in recent years. He made it clear that their plan is not to launch their own mobile data products – similar to Rain mobile – but rather focus on fixed products in the consumer and SME market. The company is also exploring a service provider model with both its LTE and fixed connectivity products. Speaking about Liquid Telecom’s strategy in South Africa, Sha said their focus remains on the business market. The company has many valuable assets, which include a large fibre footprint, LTE and microwave networks, and a VSAT business. It also has a very strong data centre presence in the country and sees this as a growth area in South Africa. Sha said Liquid Telecom’s agility enables it to respond faster and provide a more customer-centric service than its competitors, which will further fuel their growth.
