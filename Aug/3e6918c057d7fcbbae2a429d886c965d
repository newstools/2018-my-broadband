AMD’s latest high-end Ryzen Threadripper processor is now available for pre-order. The AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX CPU boasts 32 physical cores, 64 threads, and a boost clock speed of 4.2GHz. The second-generation chip is compatible with AMD’s existing X399 chipset and is built on the company’s 12nm Zen+ architecture. This powerful CPU is aimed at applications like 3D rendering or those which take advantage of its multi-threading capabilities – and is complete overkill for most games. AMD will release four new Ryzen Threadripper processors this year, with the 2990WX the first up for pre-order. The specifications and pricing for AMD’s new Ryzen Threadripper processors are below.
