Rain recently announced it will suspend the sale of its fixed-LTE products through partner ISPs, due to capacity constraints on its network. The company said the popularity of its mobile products and its strong fixed-LTE sales have put strain on its network, requiring the operator to manage its network capacity by temporarily halting fixed-LTE sales. “To ensure a continued great experience for all our customers, we have decided to suspend new sales of the fixed-wireless offering for the present time,” Rain CEO Willem Roos told MyBroadband. Soon afterwards, Cell C launched its new Data Democracy fixed-LTE packages – offering data bundles of between 15GB and 200GB per month. The LTE packages are available as SIM-only products or bundled with a router, but are only available on 24-month contracts. Cell C’s prices range from R150 for a 15GB package to R789 for a 200GB package. These prices are more affordable than Rain’s LTE-A products, and the company is now poking fun at Rain’s “patchy coverage” and its decision to suspend services. The advertisement – titled: “When it doesn’t rain, we pour. Incredible LTE-A deals available from Cell C.” – is posted below, presented by a Cell C “weatherman”.
