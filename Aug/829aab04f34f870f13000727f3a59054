Spotify is testing a new approach to advertising for its music streaming platform, AdAge reports. The streaming service is testing features which allow its free users to skip audio and video adverts whenever they play. Previously, free listeners on Spotify were required to wait the preset time of the advert before getting back to their music. Using this new system, advertisers will not have to pay for any adverts which are skipped. The feature is called Active Media and is currently exclusive to the Australian market. Speaking to AdAge, Spotify global head of partner solutions Danielle Lee said the company aims to roll out its new Active Media feature globally if testing in Australia proves successful.
