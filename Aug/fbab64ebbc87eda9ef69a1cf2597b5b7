Tesla CEO Elon Musk has voiced his intention to release the source code for Tesla’s car security software in an effort to improve the security of future self-driving cars. Following a Q&A session at the DEFCON hacking conference, Musk tweeted that he planned to open-source the carmaker’s security software. He stated that the software would be important for improving the safety of future vehicles. Earlier this year, Tesla open-sourced the buildroot material used to build the system image on its Autopilot platform in addition to the code for the Nvidia-based infotainment systems in the Model S and Model X. The manufacturer has not released the source code for its Autopilot self-driving software or the Nvidia applications it runs on its infotainment system. Great Q&A @defcon last night. Thanks for helping make Tesla & SpaceX more secure! Planning to open-source Tesla vehicle security software for free use by other car makers. Extremely important to a safe self-driving future for all. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 11, 2018
