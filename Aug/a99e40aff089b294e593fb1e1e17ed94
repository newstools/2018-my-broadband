A shooter has opened fire at a Madden NFL 19 tournament in Jacksonville, Florida. The shooting took place on Sunday afternoon, US eastern time. Reports from Ars Technica have stated that three people are dead and seven are injured, as stated by Duval County Sheriff Mike Williams. One of the dead is the shooter, who took his own life. The shooting took place at the GLHF Game Bar, in an open-air marketplace in downtown Jacksonville. Multiple reports have stated that the shooter was a competitor at the tournament “who lost and then opened fire on multiple people”. The tournament was a qualifying event for the Madden 19 Championship Series. “Live video of the competitors themselves cut to a fullscreen shot of the gameplay feed as the shooting began, but audio of gunshots and screaming victims was still being captured,” stated Ars Technica. The event was live streamed on Twitch, and video of the shooting has reportedly been published to YouTube.
