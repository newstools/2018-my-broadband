Narratiive has released its website traffic statistics for July 2018, which show that News24 remained at the top spot of the South African online publisher rankings. Narratiive, formerly known as Effective Measure, is the official traffic measurement partner of the IAB South Africa and provides accurate traffic and demographics statistics for SA’s top websites. According to the statistics, News24 is the largest South African website – with 5.6 million unique browsers. Gumtree was ranked second with 5.0 million unique SA browsers, followed by IOL with 3.8 million browsers. One of the biggest losers over the last year has been MSN, which dropped from 5th in 2017 to 10th in the latest rankings. MSN is the default home page for Internet Explorer users, and the decline may be linked to the loss of market share by the Microsoft browser. The statistics further revealed that Business Insider South Africa retained the top spot in the business category, followed closely by BusinessTech and Fin24. The table below shows the top websites in South Africa, based on South African unique browsers. Only IAB-affiliated websites running Narratiive’s tracking code are included in the table.
