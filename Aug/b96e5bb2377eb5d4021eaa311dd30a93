Nikon has unveiled two new full-frame mirrorless cameras, the Nikon Z7 and Nikon Z6. “The Z7 and Z6 are equipped with a new backside illumination Nikon FX-format CMOS sensor with built-in focal-plane phase-detection AF pixels, and the latest image-processing engine, EXPEED 6,” said Nikon. The Z7 has an effective 45.7MP, and supports a standard sensitivity range of ISO 64-25600. “In combination with NIKKOR Z lenses, the camera achieves an outstanding level of sharpness and detail, all the way to the edges of the image.” The Z6 is described as a versatile device, and an “all-purpose FX-format camera with 24.5 effective megapixels”. It supports a sensitivity range of ISO 100-51200 and full-frame 4K UHD video capture with full pixel readout, added Nikon. “These two models combine legendary Nikon reliability and a familiar interface with the benefits of a mirrorless, including rapid FPS, hybrid AF, silent shooting, and advanced multimedia capabilities.”
