Nvidia has launched its new GeForce RTX 20 Series graphics cards, which are built on its Turing GPU architecture. The new architecture combines traditional graphics rendering horsepower with real-time ray tracing and artificial intelligence powered by dedicated machine learning cores. Nvidia’s new GeForce RTX 20 Series comprises three new graphics cards – the RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 2080, and RTX 2070. The GPUs are aimed at high-end gamers and boast impressive features, including support for 8K resolutions and much higher performance than the previous-generation GeForce cards. The company added that the Founders Edition versions of its new cards will begin shipping from 20 September 2018. Following the launch, South African online retailer Evetech has listed local pricing for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Ti. The products are available to pre-order from its website.
