The latest version of Android has started rolling out to compatible devices. The new operating system – Android 9 – is currently available on Google Pixel, Pixel 2, and Essential PH-1 devices, but will soon launch to more models. Devices which participated in the Beta programme will be part of the first wave of smartphones to get the official Android update, along with a number of Android One devices. Google’s Android One programme allows compatible smartphones with near-stock systems to receive updates faster than standard devices, which require more stringent modification and testing. [View a list of the smartphones which will get Android 9 first] Android 9 brings a number of new features which change the way the OS functions, including an overhauled navigation system, and support for modern displays with notches and varied aspect ratios. The two most popular Android smartphone brands in South Africa – Samsung and Huawei – do not have any devices which are part of the early rollout, however, as they use their own operating systems built on Android. Huawei told MyBroadband that it would release the new version of its operating system next month. “Huawei will release EMUI 9.0, based on the latest Android 9 system, at the IFA in September,” said a Huawei spokesperson. Existing Huawei devices will receive the update as it is launched, beginning with the manufacturer’s P20 series. “First, the P20 series will be released in September, and the Mate series will be launched in the future,” said Huawei. The manufacturer said it is also working on developing stable and powerful software for its devices and would roll out further EMUI 9.0 updates to customers when they are ready. “Huawei has continued to invest a lot of resources in technology R&D to provide the most high-quality, stable, and top-notch technology experience for consumers.” “Therefore, when the technology is ready, we will release it to the market.”
