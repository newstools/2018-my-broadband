Nvidia has unveiled the first generation of Quadro graphics cards built on its new Turing GPU architecture. The line-up comprises the Quadro RTX 8000, RTX 6000, and RTX 5000, which all feature hardware-accelerated ray tracing, artificial intelligence, and advanced shading. Nvidia’s RTX GPUs are designed for demanding workloads such as film and video content creation, scientific simulations, and architectural design. New features include real-time ray tracing powered by RT Cores, Turing Tensor Cores for deep learning, Samsung GDDR6 memory, and NVLink support to scale memory bandwidth and capacity. The hardware also supports USB Type-C and VirtualLink, which is an open standard enabling VR headset connectivity through a single USB-C connection. The specifications of the new Quadro RTX cards are below. Nvidia’s new Quadro RTX series will be available to order from Q4 2018 on the company’s website.
