Apple has responded to questions from the House Energy and Commerce Committee in the US, stating that iPhones do not listen to users without consent, Reuters reported. This followed congressional hearings into Facebook’s privacy practices, after news emerged that its APIs had been exploited to harvest personal data from users. Facebook disclosed that 96,121 people in South Africa were affected by one such instance of data being harvested by an app called “YourDigitalLife”. According to the report, US lawmakers wrote to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google founder Larry Page in July 2018 regarding concerns about smartphones collecting “non-triggered” audio data from conversations. Apple stated that iPhones do not record audio while they are listening for audio commands to wake Siri up. Siri also does not share spoken words, said Apple.
