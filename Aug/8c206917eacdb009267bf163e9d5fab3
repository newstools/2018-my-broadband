Apple’s AirPods are the number one selling Apple product at Best Buy. Best Buy, a large electronics retailer in the US, saw a large growth in AirPods in Q4 2017 and in parts of 2018, stated Softpedia News. Published data shows that Lightning-to-3.5mm headphone adapters and Lightning-to-USB cables are also top sellers. The strong sales of Apple’s wireless AirPods and Lightning-to-3.5mm adapters has been attributed to the company removing the headphone jack from its latest range of iPhones. Devices such as the iPhone X only feature a Lightning port, which means owners must use a pair of headphones with a Lightning connector, a Lightning adapter for their existing headphones, or a Bluetooth pair. It is rumoured that Apple’s new range of iPhones – set for launch in September 2018 – will also only pack a Lightning port.
