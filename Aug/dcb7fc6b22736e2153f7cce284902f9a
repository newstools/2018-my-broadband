Yandex announced that it is testing its autonomous ride-hailing service in Innopolis, Russia. Residents of the university city can oder rides in autonomous vehicles to multiple locations, and around 100 passengers have agreed to participate in the driverless ride-hailing trial. Participants received a link to order rides through the platform through a Telegram chatbot. During the testing phase, two self-driving vehicles will operate in the city and a safety engineer will be in the passenger seat of each vehicle. “Our Yandex self-driving team plans to later expand the autonomous ride-hailing service to include more destinations, additional vehicles, and removing the safety driver in addition to improving the service based on user feedback,” said the company.
