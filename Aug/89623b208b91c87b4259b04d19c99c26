Cell C has stated it is reviewing the new draft call termination regulations from ICASA. The draft regulations propose amendments to mobile and fixed call termination rates, which Telkom previously said will result in significant job losses at its company if implemented. “Although we are pleased that ICASA has determined that the voice call termination market is still not competitive and requires remedies that include the imposition of asymmetry for smaller operators, we believe that the modelling exercise done by ICASA can and should provide for increased asymmetry than is currently proposed in the draft regulations in order to address this historic and continuing imbalance that favours dominant operators,” said Cell C CEO Jose Dos Santos. “Despite their ongoing protestations, asymmetry has little to no effect on dominant operators, due mainly to the fact that only a tiny proportion of their overall voice traffic is actually affected by this asymmetric rate.” Dos Santos stated that here is no harm, and only a benefit, in providing a regulatory framework with as much asymmetry as possible. “Anything less will continue to support the current market structure and excessive dominance displayed by Vodacom and MTN who, as history has shown, do not reduce prices unless their smaller competitors lead the way.”
