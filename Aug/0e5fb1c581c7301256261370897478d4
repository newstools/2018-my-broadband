Samsung has unveiled a new PC gaming monitor at Gamescom 2018, the CJG5. The curved gaming screen is available in 27-inch and 32-inch models, which feature WQHD resolutions (2,560 x 1,440), a 144Hz refresh rate, 3,000:1 contrast ratio, and 4ms response time. “Globally available in the third quarter of 2018, the bezel-less, game-optimised CJG5 provides a completely smooth and immersive gaming experience at a reasonable and affordable price,” said Samsung. The curved VA panel features an 1800R curvature, which minimises eye fatigue, added the company. No pricing information was detailed by Samsung.
