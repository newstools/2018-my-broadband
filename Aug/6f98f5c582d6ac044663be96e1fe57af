Samsung has launched a new mesh Wi-Fi system with a built-in SmartThings Hub. The SmartThings Wi-Fi mesh network system also features AI-based mesh Wi-Fi technology from Plume, which delivers “an intelligently optimised home network”. This automatically allocates bandwidth, mitigates interference, and delivers maximum Wi-Fi capacity across a home, said Samsung. The system consists of multiple satellites – available from today as a three-pack for $279 – which boast 2×2 MU-MIMO and 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac connectivity. Samsung said users can receive data speeds of up to 866Mbps over the system’s 5GHz band, and 400Mbps over 2.4GHz. The integration of a SmartThings Hub into the Wi-Fi system further adds to its abilities, allowing it to serve as the “brain” of a smart home. “Samsung’s open SmartThings ecosystem makes it easy to automate and manage the smart home with one hub and the SmartThings app,” added Samsung.
