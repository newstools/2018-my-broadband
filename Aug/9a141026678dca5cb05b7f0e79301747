Google has rolled back its latest Android Messages update and removed the dark mode features, according to reports from users on Reddit. The new update rolled out to users last week and included an overhauled user interface in addition to an “enable dark mode” toggle. It also sported the company’s Google Sans font and a cleaner chat interface. While the new version of Android Messages was rolling out to users, Google opted to pull the new update – reverting back to the old version. Users who had installed the update were also rolled back. Google has not stated why it rolled back the latest update, and no app-breaking conflicts were reported by users.
