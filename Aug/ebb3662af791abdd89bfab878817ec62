A team of ex-pro Dota 2 players and casters were soundly beaten by OpenAI’s team of bots in a best-of-three exhibition match. OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research organisation cofounded by Elon Musk which aims to promote and develop friendly AI. The company used machine learning to train bots to play Dota 2 and continuously improve their performance. Since OpenAI’s Dota 2 bot beat professional player Danylo “Dendi” Ishutin at the International 2017, the AI has evolved significantly. The team which won the exhibition match is named OpenAI Five, and comprises a team of five bots. OpenAI Five will take on an active professional team during the International main event in August 2018.
