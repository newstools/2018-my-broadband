Netflix has launched a “Calibrated Mode” for certain Sony Bravia TVs, which offers “studio-quality picture mastering”. The new mode works with Sony’s Bravia Master Series A9F OLED and Z9F LCD TVs. “Netflix Calibrated Mode is a new feature developed by Sony picture quality and device experts in collaboration with Netflix colour scientists,” said Netflix. “Supported for any type of content on Netflix, including but not limited to 4K and HDR, this feature leverages Sony’s strength in image processing to provide a display mode that configures the TV the same way creators calibrate their monitors in post production.” Users can then view content “as it was meant to be seen” – with precise colours, accurate dynamic contrast, and true motion. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
