Atomic Access has launched a 500Mbps uncapped fibre-to-the-home service for R1,499 per month on the Frogfoot network. The company is also offering free installation on its 200Mbps and 500Mbps products for orders before the end of September 2018. “We believe 500Mbps is the sweet spot for premium home fibre services,” said Nicholas Soper, MD of Atomic Access. “With our current Wi-Fi standards, most 802.11ac home routers will deliver speeds of around 360Mbps,” he said. “With a 200Mbps service you are limiting yourself a bit, while paying for a 1Gbps service might be an overkill for most people – especially if your Wi-Fi network can’t deliver nearly that speed.” He highlighted that depending on your Wi-Fi network, you can get speeds of up to 715Mbps – if you have 4×4 MIMO devices.
