Vodacom and Cell C have taken aim at Rain over its decision to halt fixed-LTE product sales from 1 November 2018. The company recently said the popularity of its mobile products and its strong fixed-LTE sales have put strain on its network, requiring it to manage its network capacity by temporarily halting fixed-LTE sales. Vodacom and Cell C, which offer their own LTE services, have taken the opportunity to diss Rain for the move – as shown in the tweets below. Both networks played on the company’s name – Rain – by making statements about “connectivity drying up”, and weather forecasts predicting “no chance of rain”. Rain fixed-LTE products are still listed on partner ISP websites, with new activations being provisioned until 31 October 2018.
