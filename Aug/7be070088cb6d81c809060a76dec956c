The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) will soon launch a new online booking platform for South Africans to get their driver’s licence. “Waiting in long queues will soon be a thing of the past,” states the RTMC. The online booking platform will support learner’s or driver’s licence tests, and driver’s licence renewals “all in under 10 minutes”. The platform will “ease the process of applying for vehicle driving licences and combat corruption by minimising the manipulation of the process by unscrupulous officials”, it added. “The current process requires applicants to queue for between 140-180 minutes at a testing station. This process is also fraught with corruption as officials at the licensing centres have an incentive to withhold available bookings for lucrative payments from willing applicants,” said the RTMC. “When it is launched later this month, the solution will benefit the public by promoting efficient service delivery, removing barriers to access, eliminating fraud and corruption, and optimising business operations.” The statement from the RTMC comes after vehicle and driver’s licensing centres in Tshwane started using an online booking system. The system, provided by The Online Company South Africa, is in use at the Akasia, Waltloo, Centurion, and Bronkhorstspruit licensing centres. MyBroadband tested the online platform and it was awesome – which bodes well for users if the system is rolled out to more centres.
