Apple will not launch FaceTime group calls with iOS 12 and macOS Mojave, according to a report by Engadget. When Apple unveiled iOS 12, it punted FaceTime group calls as one of the new features – with calls supporting up to 32 simultaneous users. This included a new dynamic user interface which shows all callers in a group FaceTime video call as tiles, which adjust in size and position depending on who is talking. The feature was set to make its way to macOS Mojave, too. However, the report stated that the release notes iOS 12 and Mojave developer betas show that group FaceTime won’t be available just yet. They will instead arrive as an update later this year.
