Facebook is cutting off access to its application programming interface (API) for thousands of inactive apps today. “Back in May, we announced that all apps using the Facebook Platform APIs would need to go through a more comprehensive review to better protect people’s Facebook information,” it said in a statement. Thousands of apps will be affected by the change, it added. “We’d encourage apps that are still being used but have not been submitted for app review to do so now. However, to ensure all apps currently in use go through our review process, we will be proactively queueing up apps for review.” As long as developers comply with Facebook’s platform policies, they will not lose their API access while their app is in the queue or while Facebook is reviewing it. “Our goal is to ensure that we better protect people’s Facebook information while also enabling developers to build great social experiences.”
