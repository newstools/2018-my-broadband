Twitter announced it will no longer provide updates for iOS 9 and older operating systems. The announcement was made in the “What’s New” section of the Twitter app’s listing on iTunes. “Devices on iOS 9 or older will no longer receive updates from Twitter. To get the latest feature updates, performance improvements, and bug fixes, please update to iOS 10+.” Other updates released in version 7.30 of the Twitter iOS app are accessibility improvements – including rotor support for links within Tweets, an improved VoiceOver experience for iOS 11 users, and improved Braille support. A report on TechCrunch about the change noted that the majority of Apple customers upgrade their devices when a new version of iOS is released. Data from Apple suggests that only 5% of its users are still on iOS 9 and older versions of its mobile operating system.
