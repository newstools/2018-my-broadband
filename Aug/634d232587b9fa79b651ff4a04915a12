The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL will be released on 4 October 2018, according to a report by This is Tech Today’s Brandon Lee. According to the report, Google posted a call on Famebit, an influencer marketing platform which was acquired by Google in 2016. Google asked for content creators in Canada who would be interested in making marketing videos about the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL for YouTube, and its Famebit post listed the launch date. Industry leaker Evan Blass reported that besides the Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, and second-generation Pixel Buds, Google’s upcoming hardware event will introduce a Pixel-branded watch. A second-generation Pixelbook with smaller bezels is also expected to be announced, and scheduled to ship before the end of the year.
