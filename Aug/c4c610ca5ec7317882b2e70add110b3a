Bugatti has unveiled its Divo supercar, which it said “is made for corners”. The Divo is 35kg lighter than the Chiron and packs a “limited” top speed of 380km/h. The car is powered by an 8-litre W16 engine that puts out 1,103kW, and also features 90kg more downforce than the Chiron. “The lateral acceleration of the Divo has been boosted to 1.6g,” said Bugatti, adding that it is a car “tuned for agility, nimbleness, and optimum handling performance on winding roads”. For those interested in buying one, they are already sold out. The Divo series consisted of 40 vehicles at R83 million each and were immediately purchased by the select customers who were offered them, said Bugatti.
