KFC Africa and Pizza Hut Africa recently moved to their new head offices in Johannesburg. The 3,150 square metre building hosts 230 KFC and Pizza Hut employees, and features an environmentally-friendly design. “Furthermore, the building boasts a condenser that chills refrigerant, which is distributed throughout the building to provide both heating and cooling. Sensors detect temperature in each office zone and signal the system to regulate comfort levels,” said the company. Other features at the office include a car wash, a mothers’ room, a prayer room, a sick bay, and a wellness room – which offers manicures, pedicures, facials, waxing, and massages to employees.
