According to reports, Apple may launch iPhones which support dual-SIM. 9to5Mac found reference to a “second SIM status” in the iOS 12 developer beta 5 software – hinting at a dual-SIM iPhone in the future. The report added that beta version of iOS also referred to a “second SIM tray status”, which removes the possibility of the second SIM being an Apple eSIM. Many modern Android smartphones already support a dual-SIM set-up, and allow users to insert SIMs from different network operators depending on their needs. Apple is expected to launch new iPhones in September 2018, with three new models rumoured to be coming.
