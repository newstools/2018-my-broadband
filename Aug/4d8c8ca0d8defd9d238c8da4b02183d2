The failure of officials from the Department of Energy to attend an Energy Portfolio Committee meeting on the petrol price shows its lack of plan to deal with rising fuel prices, said DA MP Gavin Davis. “This no-show by a government delegation was disrespectful to Parliament and disrespectful to the millions of South Africans who are struggling with the high cost of living,” said Davis. Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Energy was prepared to receive a briefing on South Africa’s fuel price today, but officials from the Department of Energy did not attend the meeting. The briefing was called by the committee to address concerns around increasing fuel prices. “We wanted the Department of Energy to give the public a clear idea of what influences the fuel price,” said committee Chairperson Fikile Majola. Minister of Energy Jeff Radebe was set to address the meeting, but was reportedly away in Windhoek on business. “However, the meeting was not cancelled due to the unavailability of the minister, as the deputy minister or the director-general and officials could brief the committee in the meantime,” said Majola. Majola said this behaviour would not be tolerated by the committee, and they would write to the minister. “We will not allow the executive to disrespect us. I will also report this matter to the speaker,” said Majola. Davis added that the no-show is an indication “government simply has no plan to deal with the fuel price”. “The minister has an opportunity to prove us wrong by appearing before the committee next Tuesday and presenting a credible plan to bring down the price of petrol.” The price of petrol in South Africa has risen drastically since the beginning of 2018, rising from R14.42 in January to R16.02 in July. This increase is in addition to an increase in VAT to 15% and has put added pressure on South African consumers.
