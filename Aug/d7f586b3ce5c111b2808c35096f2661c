Firefox has launched a new experiment called Advance, which inspects a user’s browsing history to deliver recommendations for related news. The Advance tool is a browser extension which includes two sections titled “Read Next” and “For You”. Both tabs are available from the Firefox browser’s sidebar once the extension is installed, and deliver different content recommendations. The Read Next tab shows suggest new articles and other content based on what you are currently viewing, while the For You tab shows content recommended for you based on your recent browsing history. Advance is developed by machine learning startup Laserlike and is available through Firefox’s Test Pilot programme. Users who sign up will have full control over when the Advance app is running and will be able to see which browser history has been made accessible to Laserlike.
