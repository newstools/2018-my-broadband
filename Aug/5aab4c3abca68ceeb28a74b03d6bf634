Apple has removed the listings of five podcasts operated by Alex Jones, including all episodes of the Infowars podcast, BuzzFeed reported. The Infowars website and podcasts focus on conspiracy theories. While Apple did not host the podcasts, iTunes provided an index to where the episodes could be downloaded. You could also subscribe to receive new episodes automatically. According to the report, Apple’s mass removal of the podcasts is one of the largest crackdowns on “conspiratorial news content” by a technology company. iTunes was not the only way Jones distributed his podcasts, but BuzzFeed reported that Apple’s platform is the largest podcast index on the Internet. A delisting will therefore have a significant impact. The report stated that one Infowars podcast, called “Real News With David Knight,” remains on iTunes. Apple declined to comment on the remaining podcast.
