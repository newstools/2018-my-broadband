A federal jury in California has found that the Apple iPhone infringes on two patents owned by Canadian firm WiLan, and has awarded $145 million in damages, Reuters reported. One patents is for a “method and apparatus for bandwidth request protocols in a wireless communication system,” and the other is for “adaptive call admission control for use in a wireless communication system.” Apple has said it will appeal the ruling. WiLan was founded in 1992 in Ottawa as a creator of wireless broadband technologies, but the business has changed to a patent licensing firm. It now acquires intellectual property and charges fees for companies to use it. Its case against Apple dates back to 2013, when it sought damages of $248 million and another United States jury ruled in favour of Apple. Reuters reported that WiLan reached licensing deals with companies such as Alcatel-Lucent, Dell, HP, HTC, Novatel Wireless, and Sierra Wireless over the patents.
