Tinder announced it is rolling out a dating platform exclusively for university students. The new service is called Tinder U and aims to make it easier for university students to connect. Interested users can log in to Tinder from their campus and provide their university email address to be invited to the platform, after which they will be sent a verification email to sign up. “And if you want to date outside your campus, we’ve got you covered there, too,” the company said. “Tinder U allows you to swipe on students at nearby schools.” Tinder said Tinder U works the same as its original dating platform, and is rolling out on iOS devices at accredited schools in the United States. There is currently no information regarding the launch of Tinder U in universities outside of the United States.
