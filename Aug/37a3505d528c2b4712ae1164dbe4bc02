NASA’s Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) has confirmed there is water on the moon in the form of ice at the poles, CNET reported. M3 launched aboard the Chandrayaan-1, India’s first mission to the moon, and provided the first mineralogical map of the lunar surface. It found water molecules in the polar regions of the moon in 2009, and scientists have now confirmed that there is ice close enough to the surface to be potentially useful as a resource in future. The research was conducted with NASA’s Ames Research Center by scientists at the University of Hawaii and Brown University. Their paper is available in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.
