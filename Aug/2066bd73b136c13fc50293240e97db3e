HMD Global has launched its affordable Nokia 3.1 smartphone in South Africa, which features Android 8.0. The Nokia 3.1 packs a 5.2-inch 1,440 x 720 LCD display and sports an aluminium frame with a plastic back. A Mediatek MT6750 octa-core CPU powers the device and it includes 2GB of RAM with 16GB internal storage – expandable up to 256GB via microSD. It also has a 13MP primary camera at the rear and an 8MP font-facing camera, with charging via a microUSB connection. “Nokia 3.1 is our most affordable 18:9 smartphone, delivering the same screen ratio you get on modern flagships to give you more content with a single glance in a slim device frame,” said HMD Global. The Nokia 3.1 is part of the Android One programme, meaning it should receive operating system updates faster than other Android smartphones. HMD Global said the Nokia 3.1 will be sold by Vodacom, MTN and leading South African retailers for a recommended price of R2,299. The device is available in Blue/Copper and Black/Chrome colour combinations.
