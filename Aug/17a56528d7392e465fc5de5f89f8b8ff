Netflix in South Africa is dropping US dollar pricing for its subscription plans. A Netflix spokesperson told MyBroadband that it has released new rand pricing for its packages, which will kick in this week. The new rand pricing is as follows: “Netflix, in its ongoing efforts to localise its offering for the South African market, will be billing South African subscribers in rands from Tuesday, 28 August 2018,” said the company. Previously, local subscribers paid a dollar-based subscription fee, which fluctuated when converted into rands thanks to exchange rate movements. Netflix also stated that it making a strong push to bring more local content to South Africans. “Since launching in the country in January 2016, the content library on the Netflix SA service has grown by over 500%, with shows that speak to South African audiences such as Girlboss, Mindhunter, and Troy: Fall of a City. It added that it will add even more locally-developed content to its library, which will include exclusive series, movies, documentaries, stand-up comedy shows, and kids content.
