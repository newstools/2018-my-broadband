Google has released a new version of its Duo video calling app for Android tablets and iPads. Users could previously install the mobile version of the Duo app on their tablets, but these versions were not properly formatted for the bigger screen. Google Duo for tablets has rolled out across iOS and Android, and is available to download from the iTunes Store for iPad. Duo supports high-quality video and voice calls across multiple platforms and is now the default video call application across many Android devices. The application also supports a Knock Knock feature, which displays a live video preview of the person calling you before you answer. This platform release follows a recent update to the Google Duo app which allows users to sign into Google Duo on multiple devices simultaneously. Rolling out over the next few days, the newest #GoogleDuo update lets you make video calls on Android tablets and iPads → https://t.co/jNB787MXhd pic.twitter.com/Kz3MeL5RUU — Google (@Google) August 27, 2018
