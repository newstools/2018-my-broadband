NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has published an open-source design for a rover vehicle based on the Mars Curiosity rover. The JPL Open Source Rover mimics the key components of Curiosity, but replaces advanced and expensive components with more simple materials and electronics. This allows anybody with the right tools to build their own rover using NASA’s design. The rover is powered by a Raspberry Pi, and the JPL GitHub repository for the project includes all the code required to use the rover. “In our experience, this project takes no less than 200 person-hours to build, and depending on the familiarity and skill level of those involved, could be significantly more,” said JPL. “Experienced builders may be able to build this project in this amount of time. However, this project is generally meant to be a teaching and learning tool.” The landing page for the JPL Open Source Rover includes more information about the project and how to get started.
