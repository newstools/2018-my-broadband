Snap recently sent a Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notice to GitHub, requesting that the platform remove a repository which contained source code for Snapchat, TorrentFreak reported. The notice is available on GitHub, and states that the repository was published under the name i5xx/Source-SnapChat, which means a user going by i5xx published the files in a repository called “Source-SnapChat”. GitHub has disabled the repository, stating the owner may file a counter notice to have it reinstated. According to the report, the uploader claims to be from a village in Pakistan called Tando Bago. At an online store linked to their username, the person claims to have a presence in Saudi Arabia for their various mobile app programming services. It is not clear how much of the source code was leaked online. “This should be removed because it is all leaked source code,” the request states. It also affirms that the code is not published under any open source licence.
