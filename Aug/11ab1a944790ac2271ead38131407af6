FNB has launched support for Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay, the company announced. FNB customers can now make payments with their FNB Visa banking cards by tapping their Fitbit or Garmin wearable on a compatible contactless point-of-sale device. “To make payment, a customer selects the wallet feature and then taps their wearable on the contactless point of sale, just as they would when paying with their FNB Pay enabled smartphone or their contactless card,” said Jason Viljoen, Head of Digital Payments at FNB. Multiple layers of security – such as encryption and tokenisation – make this one of the most secure methods of making a payment.” “Customers can rest assured that their card details will remain private and secure as they will never be shared with retailers, Fitbit, or Garmin.” If a user takes off their Fitbit or Garmin device, they will be required to enter their passcode once it is put back on to reactivate payment functionality. “The device stays authenticated for 24 hours or until you take it off your wrist. In addition, the point of sale device will also prompt you to enter your card PIN for certain transactions.” The payment solution is available to FNB/RMB Private Bank cardholders.
