Netgear has unveiled its latest Orbi mesh Wi-Fi router at IFA 2018 in Berlin. The device is named the Orbi Voice and can function as a smart speaker and Wi-Fi mesh satellite connected to any existing Orbi Wi-Fi system. Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant is built into the device and can be used to control music playback, IoT devices, alarms, and other connected devices. The Wi-Fi system’s speaker is designed by Harman Kardon, featuring a 3.5-inch subwoofer and 1-inch tweeter, and the router boasts up to 3Gbps of combined Wi-Fi speed. Orbi Voice owners can address the built-in Alexa assistant through an array of four microphones with far-field voice recognition. The Orbi Voice will be available later this year at a recommended retail price of $300.
