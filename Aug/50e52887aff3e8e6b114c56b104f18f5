Industry leaker Evan Blass has posted a tweet suggesting that Android P will be released on 20 August 2018, CNET reported. This is in line with the release dates of Android 7.0 “Nougat” (22 August 2016) and Android 8.0 “Oreo” (21 August 2017). Google unveiled Android P at its Google I/O event in California on 8 May 2018, saying that the new version of its mobile operating system is based on three pillars: intelligence, simplicity, and wellbeing. New features coming to Android P include smarter power allocation to reduce battery usage by the CPU, and adaptive brightness to optimise the power used by a device’s screen by learning the user’s preferences – not only relying on ambient lighting conditions. Another feature introduced in Android P is a dynamic screen rotation button, which appears when you rotate your phone with the auto-rotation function disabled. Tapping the button will allow you to rotate the screen, without having to enable automatic screen rotation. Android P will also receive features to limit the amount of time you spend in apps, and provide visual cues to wind down your usage before bedtime. pic.twitter.com/ovby4pC3ph — Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 2, 2018
