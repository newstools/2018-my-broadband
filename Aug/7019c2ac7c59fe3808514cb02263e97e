WhatsApp will start displaying adverts in the Status screen from 2019, according to a report by Softpedia News. The move comes after Facebook is said to have put pressure on the business unit to start making it money. The announcement also follows the launch of the WhatsApp Business API, which allows companies to chat to clients through the messaging platform. Businesses will only be able to send messages to people who contact them first, and the API will help companies automate the sending of messages. While WhatsApp will allow users to control what messages they receive from businesses, blocking the Status ads will not be possible, stated the report. “Ads will run on Facebook’s advertising system, and WhatsApp says it’s confident users will adapt to this new approach,” added the report.
