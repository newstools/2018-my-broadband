The SA government plans to spend R59 billion on bailouts for the SABC, Post Office, SAA, and Sanral, according to a report in the Sunday Times. Sources told the newspaper that the rescue plan was recently discussed by cabinet, with President Cyril Ramaphosa present. If the organisations are not given the funds, they may collapse or default on current outstanding loans. The report further stated that: Besides the looting, corruption, financial mismanagement, and extreme incompetence of employees at many state enterprises, the civil disobedience by motorists and their non-payment of e-tolls was highlighted as placing Sanral under pressure. “Sanral last year wrote off e-toll debts amounting to R3.6 billion, as Gauteng motorists simply refused to pay to use the roads,” stated the report. This comes after the organisation spent billions upgrading Gauteng’s freeways and installing the e-toll system. The latest report follows news that the SABC was on its deathbed, from a financial perspective. The SABC reportedly owes over R100 million to 64 companies and is operating on a hand-to-mouth basis. It was also recently reported that the SABC was unable to negotiate a new Bafana Bafana and Banyana Banyana broadcast rights contract due to its money problems. The SABC reportedly owes the South African Football Association over R50 million for its previous broadcast contract.
