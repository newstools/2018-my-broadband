Samsung has unveiled a new Galaxy Watch at its Note 9 launch event in New York. “Galaxy Watch brings the best of the Samsung’s Galaxy ecosystem with long-lasting battery life, LTE connectivity, wellness capabilities, and a timeless and personalised design,” said Samsung. Three design options are available: Silver, Midnight Black, and Rose Gold, all of which include customisable watch band colours. The watch is also available in two size options – 42mm (in the black or gold colours) with a 270mAh battery, and 46mm (in the silver colour) with a 472mAh – and two connectivity options, LTE or Bluetooth-only. Regardless of the design or size, the Galaxy Watch packs an Exynos 9110 dual-core 1.15GHz processor, runs the Tizen OS, and features 4GB of storage space. Users who pick an LTE model then receive 1.5GB of RAM, with the Bluetooth model packing 768MB. The new Galaxy Watch is IP68 resistant and is compatible with devices running Android 5.0 and up, or iOS 9.0 and up. The new smartwatch will go on sale in the US from 24 August 2018.
