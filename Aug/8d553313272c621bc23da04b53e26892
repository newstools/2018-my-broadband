Apple has assured clients that none of their data was compromised when an Australian teenager hacked its systems, Reuters reported. The school student, from Melbourne, Australia, appeared in Children’s Court this week where he pleaded guilty to hacking Apple, downloading 90GB of secure files, and accessing customer accounts. His defence attorney said the teen hacked Apple several times over the course of a year because he was a big fan of the company and that he dreamed of working there. He was 16 when he started hacking Apple’s systems. Australian Federal Police obtained and executed a search warrant for the teen’s home last year, the court heard, where they seized two Apple laptops, a mobile phone, and a hard drive. Sentencing in the case is set to proceed next month.
