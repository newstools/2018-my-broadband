Rain has seen an impressive uptake of its mobile offering, where it sells mobile data at R50 per GB. The popularity of the mobile packages has placed strain on its network, however, and the company has had to make tough decisions to keep its network experience optimal. Rain announced it would suspend the sale of its fixed-LTE products from 1 November 2018 due to capacity constraints on its network. The company said the decision was taken to help manage capacity and reduce strain on the network. “Due to the strong sales of our fixed-wireless offering through ISPs, and the successful launch of our mobile product, we are rapidly utilising the currently-available capacity on our network,” Rain CEO Willem Roos told MyBroadband. “In order to ensure a continued great experience for all our customers, we have decided to suspend new sales of the fixed-wireless offering for the present time.” Rain currently has over 2,200 active towers and plans to roll out another 2,800 in the next 30 months, improving capacity and coverage. The company did not confirm when and if its fixed-LTE products would become available again through ISPs. It must be noted, however, that Vodacom has a roaming agreement in place with Rain where its customers can roam on Rain’s mobile network. One way Rain could potentially ease its network capacity constraints would be to enter into a roaming partnership with Vodacom where Rain customers could roam on the Vodacom network. To see if a new agreement is in the works, MyBroadband asked Rain and Vodacom about the potential roaming deal. Vodacom CTO Andries Delport told MyBroadband that Rain would have to approach the operator if it sought a roaming agreement where its customers could roam on Vodacom. “It would be up to Rain to go through the proper channels if it sought this agreement,” said Delport. Rain declined to provide comment on the matter when contacted by MyBroadband.
