SITA has issued a statement detailing downtime on its systems on Monday morning. The agency said that services were affected from just after 10:00 to 11:40 after a recent Eskom power failure and failed battery switchover. This affected the government’s ability to deliver services, it added. “SITA is deeply concerned by these unprecedented network outages,” said the agency. It said that the outage today was the result of a power outage which happened last week Friday, 10 August. “On Friday, the networks were down during the peak hours from 8:00 to 14:30. This morning the Broadband Infraco transmission equipment – inside the SITA Centurion Switching Centre – had been running on battery power since the power outage on Friday and was depleted.” SITA is investigating why the transmission system failed to switch back to the standard power grid, as it should have. “SITA sincerely apologises to all government departments and citizens for the inconvenience caused during this time.”
