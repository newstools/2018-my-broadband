Netflix has removed the ability for users to post reviews on its online streaming platform. Visiting the How do I post reviews on Netflix? support page now returns a page which states that users are no longer able to rate shows on the platform. “You can no longer post reviews on Netflix,” the page reads. “Netflix customers were able to leave reviews on Netflix.com until mid-2018, when reviews were removed due to declining use.” Netflix has previously stated it would remove user reviews, notifying users who posted reviews that the feature would be killed. The like or dislike options for shows will remain on the platform.
