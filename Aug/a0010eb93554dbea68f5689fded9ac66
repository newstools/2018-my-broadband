Cell C and Telkom Mobile face tremendous challenges in South Africa and will not survive unless they merge. This is according to Wayne McCurrie from FNB Wealth and Investments, who said that scale is needed to survive in an increasingly-difficult mobile telecoms market. Speaking to Business Day TV, McCurrie said the golden age of the mobile telecoms industry is over – and only the strong will now survive. “A decade ago, this was a strong growth area and you could not go wrong to invest in the cellular operators,” he said. However, times have changed and companies like Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, and Telkom Mobile now face serious challenges. These include: McCurrie said the only survivors are the “big dogs” – Vodacom and MTN – because they have the scale to generate positive cashflows. He explained that MTN also tried to compensate for this declining growth by entering high-risk countries which offered opportunities. This strategy provided its own unique challenges, which was illustrated by the company’s woes in Nigeria and Iran. The pressure on mobile operators is clearly illustrated by the recent calls from the ANC to drop mobile data prices. The ANC raised concerns about the negative impact that the high cost of data has on South Africans. In a statement, the party said the high costs of data see most people unable to enjoy the benefits of the digital economy. “The ANC believes that lowering the cost of data will be a catalyst for economic growth. It will unlock economic opportunities and thus contribute to economic growth,” it said. “The mobile operators must demonstrate goodwill and lower data prices and allow government to resolve the allocation of new spectrum.” The impact of the tough market on mobile operators is evident in their share price, too, as shown below. Vodacom, MTN, Telkom, and Blue Label Telecom (a large Cell C shareholder) have all experienced sharp drops in the past year.
