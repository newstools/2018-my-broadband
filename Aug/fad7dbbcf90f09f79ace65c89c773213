MyBroadband recently conducted its Q3 2018 Broadband Survey, which showed that Cool Ideas is South Africa’s top-rated Internet service provider. The Q3 2018 Broadband Survey was completed by 4,169 local broadband subscribers. These users were typically IT professionals and tech-savvy individuals. The broadband users were asked to rate their broadband connection and ISP, selecting a score out of 5. The results of the survey are detailed below. The survey results showed that fibre subscribers were the happiest when it came to broadband technologies, with an average satisfaction rating of 4.23 out of 5. VDSL, which provides speeds of up to 40Mbps, was ranked second with 3.86, followed by wireless and fixed-LTE connections. ADSL, which only offers speeds up to 10Mbps, had the lower customer satisfaction rating among broadband connection types. For the ISP rankings, the customer ratings of the Q3 2018 Broadband Survey and the MyBroadband Speed Test service were combined. Cool Ideas was the top-rated fixed-line ISP, with an average score of 4.48, followed by Cybersmart and Vox. It should be noted that only large ISPs with their own IP ranges were included in this research.
