The Open Data Institute (ODI) recently outlined how large multinationals like Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft are collaborating through OpenStreetMap to build an openly-licensed map of the world. It stated that Microsoft was among the first to release satellite imagery and that the images are now integrated into the default editor. Microsoft also has a community of mappers contributing to OpenStreetMap in Australia. Apple has an internal volunteer programme with around 5,000 staff contributing to Missing Maps. They have released building data for France and Denmark, and are engaged with data improvement projects around the world. Facebook is exploring how tracing assisted by artificial intelligence can improve the quality of OpenStreetMap data in Thailand. Other organisations involved in the effort include DigitalGlobe and Telenav, said the ODI. DigitalGlobe made its satellite imagery available under a licence that will allow it to be used by the OpenStreetMap community. “Each of these organisations is meeting their own business objectives by contributing to OpenStreetMap. It’s also helped them to better serve their customers and users,” said the ODI.
