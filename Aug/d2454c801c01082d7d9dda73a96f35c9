Rain has fixed a bug in its system which resulted in mobile users not being able to use the service. Multiple MyBroadband readers and forum members reported that they were offline this morning – 2 August 2018 – and were presented with an “offline screen” when they attempted to access web pages using Rain mobile. The Rain account screen stated that the user’s Rain mobile service was offline – which was a result of either their spend limit being reached, or their debit order payment not going off successfully. Rain users reported, however, that their monthly fee payments were successful and their spend limits had not been reached. Despite this, they could not access the Internet. Rain CEO Willem Roos told MyBroadband that there was a bug in their billing run, which caused disconnections for several users. “We have fixed the issue and all users affected should be back online,” said Roos. Rain recently announced that it will suspend the sale of its fixed-LTE products through partner ISPs, due to capacity constraints on its network.
