Google has developed a “smart display,” a screen and speaker equipped with its AI voice assistant, Nikkei Asian Review reported. The search giant aims to release the device before the December holiday shopping season, and will compete against Amazon’s Echo Show. Citing an industry source, the report stated that Google plans to ship three million units in the first batch of its new device. Canalys estimated that Amazon shipped 315,000 Echo Show devices in 2017. Google announced the launch of its voice assistant platform on smart displays earlier this year, encouraging third-parties to integrate its technology in their devices.
