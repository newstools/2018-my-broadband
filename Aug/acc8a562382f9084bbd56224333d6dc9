Uber has increased the minimum fare for its UberX service from R20 to R25. This change came into effect on 31 July 2018, with Uber confirming the minimum price increase in a blog post. However, it noted that the previous minimum fare of R20 will still apply to all trips starting in Soweto, while the Port Elizabeth UberGO minimum fare has changed from R17 to R20. The price of UberBLACK and UberVAN services is unaffected, and Uber said its UberX fare hike was implement to help provide reliable earning opportunities for drivers. “We are making various changes and improvements to help provide reliable earning opportunities for driver-partners and a reliable service for you, our riders,” said Uber. Uber is also rolling out a tiered service fee, rewarding driver-partners for completing more trips by lowering their weekly service fee.
