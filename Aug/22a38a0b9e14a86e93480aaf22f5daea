BMIT has released its 2018 Digital Lifestyle Measure (DLM) results, which show that Apple remains the most popular brand among high-tech consumers. The DLM segmentation was created by BMIT in 2008 to classify consumers based on the extent of their digital lifestyles. Consumers are classified as DLM 1 (low-tech) to DLM 5 (high-tech), where a higher classification shows a more digital lifestyle. Consumers are scored by answering a list of questions about their personal digital activities, as well as the technologies in their household. Each consumer then receives a total DLM score, which indicates which of the 5 DLM segments they fall into. It must be noted that the DLM classification only applies to consumers who have Internet access. There is a far higher percentage of DLM 1 and DLM 2 consumers in South Africa than DLM 3, 4, and 5. The image below provides an overview of the breakdown of DLM segments in South Africa.  BMIT’s 2018 Digital Lifestyle Measure results show that Samsung devices are preferred by a greater percentage of lower-DLM consumers. The popularity of Apple and Huawei devices increase as consumers’ DLM scores go up, with nearly a third of DLM 5 consumers using Apple devices. “32% of DLM 5 consumers prefer Apple devices, compared to 31% who prefer Samsung,” stated the report. The chart below shows the breakdown of mobile device brands among the five DLM segments.
