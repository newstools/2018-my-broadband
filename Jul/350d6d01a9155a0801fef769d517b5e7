Blackview SA is offering a wide range of affordable Blackview devices to the South African market – with a “smartphone for everyone” campaign. Blackview was first launched globally five years ago, offering well-designed, robust, and affordable Android devices, and was introduced to South Africans when Blackview SA launched in 2014. The Blackview range has been tested worldwide by various panels of smartphone groups, and has stood up to all other well-known brands – even outperforming many of them with its true HD screen quality. The brand is best known for its RUGGED range, which includes the popular BV6000s, BV7000, and BV8000, which are waterproof, drop-proof, and dust-proof. The RUGGED range appeals to users in industries such as construction, logistics, farming, mining, and armed response, and several top companies in these industries are long-standing Blackview customers due to the quality and affordability of the range. Blackview’s variety of smartphones has expanded beyond the RUGGED range in recent months, however, with a fit for every need and pocket – extending from entry-level phones to those with long-lasting batteries. All Blackview devices are Android-based, support dual-SIM functionality, and are ICASA-approved and Google GSM-certified – with prices ranging between R2,700 and R9,000. All Blackview products also carry a one-year warranty, and Blackview SA has a repair centre and support team based in Centurion. Users can log a ticket via the Blackview SA website or by emailing info@blackview.co.za. Users can also call 087 5511 587 for assistance. Blackview products can be shipped nationwide, and collections can also be arranged at Blackview in Centurion. For more information and to see the smartphones on offer, visit the Blackview SA website.
