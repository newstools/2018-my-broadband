Digital Extremes has announced that Warframe will launch on the Nintendo Switch. Waframe is a free-to-play cooperative shooter which is currently available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game relies on an in-game store with purchasable items and a premium currency called Platinum to generate revenue, but the title is playable for free with nothing locked behind a paywall. Warframe has seen a steady increase in players on Steam of late, which is due in part to its regular content updates. The Switch version of the game is being developed by Panic Button, a specialised port developer which also worked on Nintendo Switch ports for Doom and Wolfenstein. There is currently no release date for Warframe on the Nintendo Switch.
