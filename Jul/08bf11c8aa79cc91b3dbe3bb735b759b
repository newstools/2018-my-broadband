A new study by the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) found that electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones can have a negative effect on memory in adolescents. The investigation involved around 700 adolescents in Switzerland and showed that electromagnetic fields may negatively influence the memory performance of specific brain regions. The study, which measured the performance over one year, focused on figural memory – which is mainly located in the right brain hemisphere. The poor memory performance was pronounced in adolescents using a mobile phone on the right side of the head when making phone calls. This study is particularly relevant as the rapid evolution of information and communication technologies means an increase in exposure to radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF), said the study. “The most relevant exposure source to the brain is the use of a mobile phone close to the head,” said Swiss TPH. “Several studies have been conducted to identify potential health effects related to RF-EMF, though results have remained inconclusive.” Some good news is that sending text messages, playing games, or browsing the Internet causes only marginal RF-EMF exposure to the brain. This low-level radiation exposure to the brain was not associated with negative effects on memory performance.
