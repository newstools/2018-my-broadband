A former South African president was recently asked what he thought about the latest petrol price hike. “Paying more for petrol only happens to people who are rude,” he said. “I have been using the same petrol station for 10 years, and I always pay the same price.” “I drive up and politely ask the petrol attendant for R200. And you know what, for the past 10 years I have always got R200. I never paid a cent more,” he concluded.
