Vodacom has partnered with Nokia to deliver a virtual reality viewing experience for the Durban July (7 July 2018). The demonstration will leverage the high speed and low latencies of 5G technology to stream live 4K footage from the Greyville racecourse. VR cameras will broadcast a live, 360-degree video feed to the Vodacom hospitality suite, where guests will be able to view the race through VR headsets. The first camera is positioned at the Parade Ring, while the second will stream live video from the finish line. Vodacom said the video feeds will be streamed in real-time over a Nokia Airscale 5G base station, using 100MHz of Vodacom’s spectrum in the 28GHz frequency band. “In keeping with the theme of the digital age, this year’s Vodacom Durban July will showcase the future of mobile networks,” said Vodacom CTO Andries Delport. Vodacom will also erect 12 base stations at the Greyville racecourse to cope with the crowds on the day – expected to exceed 50,000 visitors. Vodacom said the base stations have been enabled with 4G+ technology to increase network capacity and speeds.
