Intel has announced that it will purchase fabless semiconductor company eASIC to improve its position in the IoT and cloud storage market. eASIC manufactures chips for use in wireless and cloud environments, offering cutting-edge technologies with support for 5G networking. Following the acquisition, the company will become part of Intel’s Programmable Solutions Group. “The addition of eASIC will help us meet customers’ diverse needs of time-to-market, features, performance, cost, power, and product life cycles,” said Intel. “This combination brings together the best-in-class technologies from both companies to provide customers with more choice, faster time-to-market, and lower development costs.” Intel added that the acquisition will allow the company to address wireless, networking, and IoT markets, offering an automated conversion process from FPGAs to ASICs.
