YouTube is set to launch its Copyright Match tool next week after beta testing it for almost a year, Variety reported. “The Copyright Match Tool finds full re-uploads of your original videos on other YouTube channels. Once a match has been identified, you can review it in YouTube Studio and choose which action you’d like to take,” YouTube states on its support site. When you upload your original video to YouTube, it begins scanning all of the videos that are uploaded after yours to see if any of them match. “It’s important that you are the first to upload the content to YouTube as a public video, since we use the video upload time to decide who should see matches,” said YouTube. “Please make sure that you use the Copyright Match Tool responsibly,” added YouTube. “Misuse, including intentional or repeated abuse of the copyright removal process, or attempted probing or reverse engineering of the match system may result in loss of feature access or termination of your YouTube partnership.” YouTube also stated that if an upload matches your video, it doesn’t guarantee that it is copyright infringement.
