According to Miro, a leading distributor of wireless, networking, VoIP, and IP video products, more technologies can integrate across common platforms and industries to offer clients increasingly flexible, customised, and affordable options. However, not everyone is able to offer all those solutions in one easy-to-deploy package. The two-day Miro Ignite Expo, which kicked off at the Kyalami Racetrack in Midrand on 26 July 2018, was created to address this need, and offers attendees the opportunity to interact with specialists in their respective fields. Through these interactions, professionals in the security, telecommunications, networking and wireless industries can find out how they can offer the ideal solution for every individual business – and open a world of possibilities that will help organisations ignite their potential. Exhibitors at the expo – such as SS Telecoms, Elvey, and Bosch – are showcasing the latest technologies and solutions, using interactive displays, and are offering free seminars to attendees and delegates until 27 July. A look at the Miro Ignite Expo exhibition area is below.          This article was published in partnership with Miro.
