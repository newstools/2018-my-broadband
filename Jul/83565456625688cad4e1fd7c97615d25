Microsoft is improving the Windows command-line environment, according to a report by Ars Technica. The report stated that Microsoft previously upgraded the Windows console for users, and more work is set to be done by the company. An improved console is being built, which will provide a better experience for users. The command-line programs, however, are not being changed. The latest Windows 10 Insider builds are reported to feature the improvements, with a “big reveal of the new API coming soon”. This is set to include effective tabbed consoles, emoji support, rich Unicode, and more. Microsoft has also published a blog on the history of the command line and its use, for those interested in its origins.
