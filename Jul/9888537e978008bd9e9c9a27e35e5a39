Amazon has selected two writers to develop its upcoming Lord of the Rings TV series, Entertainment Weekly reports. The writers are JD Payne and Patrick McKay, who both worked on the script for Star Trek: Beyond and are currently developing its upcoming sequel. Neither of the writers have previously worked on a TV series, but they said they were excited to begin work on Amazon’s Lord of the Rings project. “The rich world that J.R.R. Tolkien created is filled with majesty and heart, wisdom and complexity,” the writers said. “We are absolutely thrilled to be partnering with Amazon to bring it to life anew.” Amazon has allocated a production budget of around $500 million to the upcoming series, and is reportedly paying $250 million for the rights to the Lord of the Rings franchise.
