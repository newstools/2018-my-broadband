Streaming is quickly becoming the new way to watch live sports internationally, and South African usage of live streaming services is also increasing. MultiChoice said it has noted a strong trend towards live streaming major sports events on its DStv Now app. The company said the number of people using DStv Now in June 2018 was five-times higher than a year ago, with the biggest peaks during major football and rugby games. The FIFA World Cup 2018 has been a major contributor towards this increased adoption, with average weekday usage of the DStv Now app increasing 60% since the beginning of the event. MultiChoice said the peak in concurrent usage for one event was reached on 26 June, during the Nigeria vs Argentina game. First-time user volumes have also tripled on Android and doubled on iOS since the start of the World Cup, and mobile apps have become the most popular method of watching DStv Now. The company added that it is working on implementing 4K streaming on its DStv Now app. “We’re continuing to develop DStv Now, with 4K streaming in testing and smart TV and Apple TV apps on their way shortly,” said MultiChoice Chief Operating Officer Mark Rayner. “The other key priority for us is working with the telcos to deliver mobile data propositions that make watching online painless and worry-free for our customers,” said Rayner.
