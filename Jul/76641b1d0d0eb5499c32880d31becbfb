Rolls-Royce has revealed a new concept design for an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) vehicle at the Farnborough International Airshow 2018. The company said its design could serve multiple purposes, from logistics and military applications to personal and public transport. The vehicle uses gas turbine technology to generate electricity and power six low-noise electric motors. Once the vehicle reaches cruising height, four of its propellers on the wing fold away, reducing noise considerably. It also sports a large on-board battery for energy storage and can carry up to five passengers for 800km at speeds of up to 400km/h. Rolls-Royce said its electric flying vehicle could be available after 2020.
