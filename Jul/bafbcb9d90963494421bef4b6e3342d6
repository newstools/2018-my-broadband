WhatsApp has a big problem with fake news on its platform and is now looking for help from researchers to solve it. The company has commissioned a competitive set of awards to researchers interested in exploring issues related to misinformation on WhatsApp. “The WhatsApp Research Awards will provide funding for independent research proposals that are designed to be shared with WhatsApp and Facebook,” said WhatsApp. Mashabale reported that grants of up to $50,000 are available to researchers whose proposals are approved. The WhatsApp Research Awards follows a warning from the Indian government about the abuse of WhatsApp. “Instances of lynching of innocent people have been noticed recently because a large number of irresponsible and explosive messages filled with rumours and provocation are being circulated on WhatsApp,” it said. It added that these concerns have been shared with WhatsApp’s management, and that “they have been advised that necessary remedial measures should be taken to prevent proliferation of these fake messages”.
