Qualcomm has unveiled the world’s first fully-integrated 5G NR mmWave and sub-6GHz RF modules for smartphones. The Qualcomm QTM052 antenna and QPM56xx RF module are designed to work with the Snapdragon X50’s 5G modem, delivering high bandwidth capabilities in a compact size. Qualcomm said the development of these modules is a major milestone for the smartphone industry. “Qualcomm Technologies’ early investment in 5G has allowed us to deliver to the industry a working mobile mmWave solution that was previously thought unattainable, as well as a fully-integrated sub-6GHz RF solution,” said Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon. “Now, these type of modem-to-antenna solutions, spanning both mmWave and sub-6 spectrum bands, make mobile 5G networks and devices, especially smartphones, ready for large scale commercialisation.” The mmWave antenna supports beam forming, steering, and tracking technologies, improving the range and reliability of mmWave signals. Qualcomm said its new modules are now sampling to customers, meaning they could be available in the next generation of commercial flagship smartphones.
