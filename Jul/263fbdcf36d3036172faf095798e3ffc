Instagram has rolled out a new status indicator feature to its platform, allowing users to see when their friends are active on Instagram. If a friend is active on the app, a green dot will appear next to their profile picture. The status indicator will appear in various spaces in the Instagram app, including the direct inbox and friends list. However, users will only be able to see the online status for friends who follow them, or people they have talked to in direct messaging. Users will also be able to hide their activity status and turn off the ability to see when friends are active on the app using the settings menu. “DMing friends and connecting over the content you love is more fun when you know your friends are there to see it,” said Instagram. “This update gives you the ability to have more of those real-time conversations while giving you the control to hide your status altogether.”
