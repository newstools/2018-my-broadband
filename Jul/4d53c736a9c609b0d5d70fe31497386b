Google has partnered with a number of distributed ledger technology (DLT) startups to bring blockchain technology to its cloud platform. The company announced in a blog post it has partnered with Digital Asset and BlockApps to integrate blockchain solutions into its cloud services. Google said customers will be able to test open source integrations for Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum later this year through its Google Cloud Product Marketplace. Digital Asset stated that its partnership with Google Cloud will allow developers to access a comprehensive set of tools to build blockchain applications on demand. “We are delighted to innovate with Digital Asset in the distributed ledger space,” said Google Cloud head of financial services Leonard Law. “DLT has great potential to benefit customers, not just in the financial services industry, but across many industries – and we’re excited to bring these developer tools to Google Cloud.”
