DStv Access, Family, Compact, and Compact Plus customers will receive access to all 13 SuperSport channels from 13-31 July 2018. MultiChoice said the promotion was its way of thanking customers for their continued support. “Sport has a beautiful way of uniting friends and families, and sometimes even strangers,” said MultiChoice South Africa CEO Calvo Mawela. “This is our way of thanking our customers for their support.” This open period will let DStv customers watch the FIFA World Cup final and the third-place playoff match, he added. Other prominent sporting events throughout the open period include the Wimbledon finals, the German and Hungarian Formula One Grand Prix, and the Super Rugby playoffs.
