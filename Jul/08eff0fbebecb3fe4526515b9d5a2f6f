Facebook has rolled out a new feature to its Messenger app which allows users to sync their Instagram account with the platform, TechCrunch reported. The new option is available under the People menu in Messenger, next to the option to sync your smartphone contacts with the platform. Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch it has officially launched the new option. Once you have synced your Instagram account with Facebook messenger, the app will automatically add contacts from Instagram – and your Instagram username will become visible to other Messenger users. A similar feature to this “connect Instagram” option was briefly available at the end of 2017, although it never launched to the public.
