Samsung has big changes in store for its smartphone line-up, according to a report by Softpedia. The report stated that Samsung may stop its Note range of smartphones, and launch a bigger Galaxy S device – with a stylus  – in its place. Samsung’s Galaxy Note and Galaxy S smartphones are the company’s flagship devices, and all sport similar top-end hardware. One of their major differences is screen size. The Galaxy S9 and S9+ sport 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch displays respectively, while the Galaxy Note 8 packs a 6.3-inch display and comes with a stylus. Recent reports have stated that Samsung will launch a new Galaxy Note 9 in August, however. There have also been rumours that Samsung will launch three versions of its next Galaxy S device – the Galaxy S10 – later this year.
