Samsung has developed 10-nanometer (nm) class 8-gigabit (Gb) LPDDR5 dynamic random access memory (DRAM). “This development of 8Gb LPDDR5 represents a major step forward for low-power mobile memory solutions,” said Jinman Han, a senior vice president at Samsung. “We will continue to expand our next-generation 10nm-class DRAM line-up as we accelerate the move toward greater use of premium memory across the global landscape.” Samsung’s new DRAM will be available in two bandwidths: 6,400Mb/s, at a 1.1 operating voltage, and 5,500Mb/s at 1.05V. This makes it up to 1.5 times faster than the LPDDR4X Samsung memory used in top-end phones today – which runs at 4,266Mb/s. With the increased transfer rate, the LPDDR5 memory can send 51.2GB of data in a second. “By doubling the number of memory banks – subdivisions within a DRAM cell – from 8 to 16, the new memory can attain a much higher speed while reducing power consumption,” said Samsung. The memory also makes use of a speed-optimised circuit architecture that verifies and ensures the chip’s ultra-high-speed performance.
