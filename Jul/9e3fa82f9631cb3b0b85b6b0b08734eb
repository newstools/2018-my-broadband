Samsung Display announced that its new unbreakable smartphone display panel has been certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL). UL is an official testing company for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the US Department of Labor. Samsung’s new display is a flexible OLED panel which forgoes a traditional rigid glass window for a cutting-edge fortified plastic protector. “The fortified plastic window is especially suitable for portable electronic devices, not only because of its unbreakable characteristics, but also because of its lightweight, transmissivity, and hardness, which are all very similar to glass,” said Samsung Display. UL certified that the display passed the real-time durability test based on US military standards, surviving 26 successive drop tests at 1.2 metres and withstanding extreme temperatures. Samsung conducted its own drop tests on the panel at 1.8 metres, resulting in no signs of damage or change in operation. There is currently no information available as to when the display will begin appearing in Samsung smartphones.
