Facebook and Instagram are testing a new Do Not Disturb feature, according to a report by TechCrunch. The feature will allow users to turn off app notification for 30 minutes, one hour, two hours, eight hours, or 24 hours. Users will also be able to turn off notifications permanently until they are manually re-enabled. Facebook is reportedly also testing a feature which will allow its mobile app users to turn off sound and vibration for notifications. This follows Apple and Google both announcing overhauled Do Not Disturb features for their respective operating systems. Instagram also unveiled a new “You’re All Caught Up” feature, which will notify users once they have scrolled over posts published in recent days.
