Motorola has unveiled a version of its Moto E5 Play smartphone running Android Go. The device sports an 8MP rear camera and 5MP front-facing camera, along with a fingerprint sensor on the back of its rounded chassis. The Moto E5 Play is one of the first devices with Android Go to ship this year, and is the first device from Motorola to run the lightweight operating system. Android Go is a version of Android 8.0 Oreo designed for budget smartphones, offering less storage and RAM usage, and a selection of streamlined applications. The operating system is lighter and cleaner, although it sacrifices a number of features to achieve this. Motorola said its new Moto E5 Play would be available this month in various countries in Europe and Latin America for €109.
