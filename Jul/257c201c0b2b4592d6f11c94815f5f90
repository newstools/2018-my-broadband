The Microsoft Edge beta for iOS now supports Visual Search, which can search for related links using images from your smartphone camera, OnMSFT reported. The feature launched on Android last month, and can use camera roll images or photos to deliver related search results. The update for iOS also includes a paste-and-search feature, allowing users to search for terms saved in their clipboard instead of having to paste them in the search field. Users with work or school accounts can also monitor their mobile activity on their PC’s timeline and access intranet websites from their home. The Microsoft Edge beta is available through Apple’s TestFlight programme.
