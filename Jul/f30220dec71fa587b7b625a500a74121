Liquid Telecom has delivered a Microsoft ExpressRoute peering service to the Western Cape Government. The ExpressRoute offers customers better performance, tighter security, and lower latency to Microsoft’s Azure servers. The Western Cape selected the service as part of a process to overhaul its communications infrastructure. Microsoft ExpressRoute is part of Liquid Telecom’s CloudConnect offering, which allows business to establish private connections to Azure from Africa. Previously, users were required to access the ExpressRoute service from peering services in Europe. “Our advanced ExpressRoute offering is another important step forward for Africa’s Cloud,” said Liquid Telecom group chief product officer David Behr. “Liquid Telecom’s CloudConnect service is strongly positioned to be the highway that links businesses to a whole host of leading local and global cloud services.”
