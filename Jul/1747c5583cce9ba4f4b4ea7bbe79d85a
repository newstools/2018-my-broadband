Over the last year, the price of petrol has increased significantly – which has sparked an outcry from South Africans. For the first time in history, South Africans who live inland pay above R16 per litre for 95 octane petrol. The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) highlighted that the levies we pay to the government and “the corrupt Road Accident Fund” have also tripled over the past decade. “It’s time to demand that the South African government use our taxes to better the lives of all citizens,” said OUTA. It is, however, not only the price of petrol which has increased significantly in recent years. In fact, the price of both a Bic Mac and DStv Premium has increased more than petrol between 2008 to 2018. There is some good news, though, as the price of mobile data has decreased by 74% over the last 10 years, while the price of ADSL data has plummeted by 99%. The graphic below provides an overview of how prices of popular products in South Africa have changed over the past decade.
