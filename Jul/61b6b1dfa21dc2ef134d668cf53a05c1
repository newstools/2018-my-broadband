Numerous employees at Internet Solutions are facing retrenchment as a round of staff cuts is planned at the company. MyBroadband has received information that several hundred employees have received notifications that their positions are at risk. The company, however, plans to re-employ some of the employees who are facing retrenchment. The latest staff cuts at IS follow a similar process in September 2016, where the company cut jobs to “streamline departments, roles, and responsibilities”. At the time, Internet Solutions CEO Saki Missaikos said the company was undergoing a “rationalisation process across all business units”. “The restructure aims to deliver improved client experience, through more efficient and competitive operations,” said Missaikos at the time. “Through this process, Internet Solutions will continue to intensify focus on areas where they are positioned for long-term leadership, client value, and growth.” It is not clear what is behind the latest round of staff cuts at Internet Solutions, and how the previous restructuring fits into the picture. MyBroadband asked Internet Solutions for comment regarding its planned staff cuts, and the company said it was preparing a media statement on the matter.
