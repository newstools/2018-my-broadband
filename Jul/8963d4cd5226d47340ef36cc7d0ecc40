Gautrain workers are on strike, with wage talks between the United National Transport Union (UNTU) and the train’s operators deadlocked. The strike is set to affect operations of the Gautrain. OR Tambo International management has warned that passengers travelling to the airport will also be affected. “Airport management advises air passengers to give themselves more time than usual to get to the airport,” stated OR Tambo. The Gautrain operating company said the strike was regrettable. “The Bombela Operating Company has offered an 8.5% increase in salaries and all benefits. Furthermore, the minimum wage for operational staff will be increased to R8,500 per month. This offer was rejected by UNTU whose latest demand, as communicated to the media, equates to a global increase of 19.5%,” it stated. Details of the Gautrain contingency arrangements can be viewed on the Gautrain website. They are also detailed below. “The reduced service will consist of a peak period train service between 05:45-09:00 and 16:00-19:00 between Centurion and Sandton every 12 minutes, and between Sandton and Park stations every 20 minutes.” “No train service will be available during the off-peak period and only Centurion, Sandton, and Park stations will be open. All trains will be 8-car trains and operate in both directions.” “Buses will service only Centurion, Sandton, and Park stations for the above peak periods and follow the usual bus routes.” “To accommodate airport and Rhodesfield passengers, we will operate a bus service between Sandton and Rhodesfield stations and a bus or midi-bus service between Rhodesfield and OR Tambo stations.” “This service will operate from 05:45-19:00. A fixed fare of R21 per bus trip will apply for this service.”
