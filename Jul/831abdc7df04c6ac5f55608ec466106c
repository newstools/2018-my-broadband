Google recently updated its developer policies for apps published on the Google Play store, introducing bans on cryptocurrency mining, Android Police reported. This is not the first time Google has adjusted its policies. The report noted that the company made amendments in April 2018, when it banned fake ID apps from Google Play. In addition to banning apps which mine cryptocurrency, the new policy does not allow developers to upload applications that contain adult themes, but appeal to children. It has also banned applications which facilitate the sale of explosives, firearms, ammunition, or certain firearms accessories. Apps that provide instructions on how to make your own guns, ammunition, and accessories, or perform semi-automatic or automatic conversions, are included in the ban. Apps with “repetitive content” have also been banned. Google characterises this category as “multiple apps with highly similar content and user experience.” Apps that are created by an automated tool, wizard service, or based on templates and that are submitted to Google Play by the operator of that service on behalf of someone else also fall into this category. Apps whose primary purpose is to serve ads, and misleading apps are also included in this ban.
