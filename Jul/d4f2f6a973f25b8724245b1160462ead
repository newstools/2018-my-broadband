MyBroadband’s latest consumer survey results show that MTN is rated as the best mobile data provider in South Africa, knocking Telkom off the top spot. The Q3 2018 Broadband Survey was completed by 4,169 local broadband subscribers. These users were typically IT professionals and tech-savvy individuals. The broadband users were asked to rate the mobile data service which they use on their smartphone, with MTN coming out on top. In recent years, Telkom topped the rankings thanks to its excellent value for money – but this time around it had to settle for second place. While consumers still said Telkom offers the best value for money, MTN’s excellent network quality has seen it enjoying far higher customer satisfaction levels. Over the last year, MTN has consistently topped the best network rankings in South Africa, thanks to its R30-billion investment into its network over the past three years. The biggest loser in the survey was Cell C, which dropped from second place in September 2017 to last place in the latest results. The main reason for Cell C’s drop in the ratings is its poor network. It has the worst network in South Africa, as illustrated in MyBroadband’s network quality tests. Rain, which is a newcomer to the South African mobile data market, achieved good ratings from its subscribers. It was not included in the latest report, however, as it did not have enough subscribers who completed the survey to provide an accurate results measurement. The table below provides an overview of the latest mobile data provider ratings, along with the year-on-year change.
