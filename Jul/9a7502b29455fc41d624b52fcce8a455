YouTube has delivered an update to its desktop web player which allows the interface to automatically adapt to each video’s aspect ratio. The streaming service now varies the video size for different aspect ratios, removing black bars on the sides of vertical videos and increasing the height of the video player where necessary. Standard 16:9 videos now also occupy more screen space than before, which YouTube said enhances video size without impacting quality. Videos with a 4:3 aspect ratio now also make more efficient use of the web player’s screen space, thanks to a slight increase in height and the removal of black bars on the sides of the video. This update aligns the desktop and mobile viewing experiences, as these features are already available within the YouTube app on Android and iOS devices.
