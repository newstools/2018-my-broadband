Tesla met its production goals for the Model 3 last week, producing a total of 5,000 vehicles. Elecktrek obtained an email sent by Tesla CEO Elon Musk to staff congratulating them on exceeding the company’s goal of manufacturing 5,000 Model 3 cars and 2,000 other Tesla vehicles in a single week. “The level of dedication and creativity was mind-blowing,” Musk said in the email. “We either found a way or, by will and inventiveness, created entirely new solutions that were thought impossible.” “Not only did we factory gate 5,000 Model 3’s, but we also achieved the S & X production target for a combined 7,000 vehicle week.” Musk predicted increased production for the carmaker’s Model 3 last month, stating he was confident Tesla would reach its goals. Tesla has made major changes in the lead-up to meeting its production goals, including performing a restructuring which resulted in 9% – or over 3,000 – of its employees being laid off. The carmaker is expected to release more detailed production numbers for the second quarter of 2018 this week.
