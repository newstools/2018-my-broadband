While Netflix is testing different packages and prices, it has no plans to increase its monthly fee in South Africa, a Netflix spokesperson told MyBroadband. The streaming provider recently tested an Ultra tier in Italy, positioned above its Premium tier at €16.99 per month. An Ultra package allows up to four devices to stream simultaneously using the same account, offers video quality of up to UHD, and supports high dynamic range. Netflix’s Premium package, priced at €13.99, previously supported up to four simultaneous devices and UHD video. As part of the test, Netflix decreased the number of simultaneous devices on Premium from four to two. It also decreased the number of simultaneous devices allowed on a Standard subscription from two to one. In 2017, Netflix increased the prices of its Standard and Premium packages in many countries, but stated it would not hike prices in South Africa. With the company testing changes to its plans, this raised the question as to wether more price increases were on the horizon. Netflix confirmed that it has no plans for a price increase in South Africa at the moment, however. Regarding the Ultra package, along with the changes that go with it, Netflix said the test may never become part of its main product offering. “We continuously test new things at Netflix and these tests typically vary in length of time. In this case, we are testing slightly different price points and features to better understand how consumers value Netflix,” said the company. “Not everyone will see this test and we may not ever offer specific elements included in the test to our members.”
