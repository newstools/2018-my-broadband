Netflix South Africa has taken a swipe at MultiChoice’s DStv with a parody “Netflix installation” video. The video, posted below, shows a Netflix installation agent going to people’s homes and installing Netflix for them. The video is clearly aimed at DStv, which requires users to have a satellite dish and linked decoder installed in their homes to access the satellite TV service. DStv installations are typically done by approved agents – and Netflix has referenced this with their “Man in a Van” character installing Netflix. As Netflix is an Internet steaming service which can be accessed via an app or web browser, there is no need for a physical installation. The video ends with the text “Get Netflix yourself. No installation required”, reinforcing this point. Netflix’s video comes after MultiChoice stated that the streaming player must pay local taxes in South Africa and abide by BEE regulations. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Jokes aside, no installation required. pic.twitter.com/HuAPM8Npzs — Netflix South Africa (@NetflixSA) July 23, 2018
