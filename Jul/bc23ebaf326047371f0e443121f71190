WhatsApp announced it will now indicate to users which messages have been forwarded to them. The change was implemented to curb the spread of misinformation and spam on the platform and to help users determine whether a message was actually written by a contact. “WhatsApp cares deeply about your safety,” the company said in a blog post. “We encourage you to think before sharing messages that were forwarded.” The “forwarded” label will apply to all text, image, audio, and video messages forwarded to users. WhatsApp has also launched a new group setting for admins where only admins are able to send messages to a group. This option can be enabled by opening Group Settings and enabling the “Only Admins” setting under “Send Messages”. “One way people use groups is to receive important announcements and information, including parents and teachers at schools,” said WhatsApp. “We’ve introduced this new setting so admins can have better tools for these use cases.”
