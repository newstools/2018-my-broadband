MTN has stated on its Twitter account that a technical error is affecting subscribers on its network. A “small percentage” of subscribers is affected by the glitch, which impacts recharging, airtime and data balances, and calling minute balances, said MTN. “The resolution is a priority, and all balances and services will be restored in the course of today. We apologise for any inconvenience,” stated MTN. Customers have complained online that their airtime and data balances are empty as a result of the glitch, and they cannot access recharging services. MTN has told users on Twitter it will restore their airtime and data allotments, and give them an extra R100 MTN airtime and 100MB of data as additional compensation. MTN was asked for comment on the matter – including what caused the glitch, and how many customers were affected – but it did not immediately reply to questions.
