Instagram is adding a feature which will allow users to ask questions in Stories, reported Android Police. While polls already exist in the app, this new feature will allow content creators to include an open text field in their Stories. Viewers can then respond to the creator’s included question or statement by typing their response in a text field. An Android Police user confirmed the feature has been implemented, although it has yet to roll out to all devices. Users from Indonesia and Italy have also reported seeing the new option in the Stories interface, but Instagram has not yet confirmed the new feature. These reports follow Instagram announcing the ability to add soundtracks to Stories last week.
