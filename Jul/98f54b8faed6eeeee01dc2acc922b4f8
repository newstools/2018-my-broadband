At the end of Q2 2018, Amazon had 34% market share, while Google had 6%. Amazon’s market share is bigger than its next four closest rivals combined.

According to the report, Amazon grew its cloud revenue by almost 49% during the quarter to $6.11 billion. Microsoft did not reveal its quarterly revenue for Azure, but said revenue for its cloud platform grew by 89%.
