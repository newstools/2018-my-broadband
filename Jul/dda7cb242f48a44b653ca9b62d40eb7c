MyBroadband has launched its latest South African Broadband Survey, which gives you the chance to rate your mobile provider, ISP, and broadband service. The survey also gives you a chance to express your interest in accessing fibre if you do not currently have coverage in your neighbourhood. The survey will only take one minute to complete, and you stand a chance to win R2,000 cash and other cool prizes. Complete the survey here: South African Broadband Survey The survey closes on 30 July 2018, and your feedback will provide great insight into the local broadband market. Prize winners will be announced after the survey closes.
