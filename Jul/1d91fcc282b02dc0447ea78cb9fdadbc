MyBroadband recently received a complaint from a reader who ported their cellphone number from Vodacom to Telkom, only to find that calls from the Vodacom network were not reaching him anymore. This is not the first time such problems have been reported, although based on the reports and feedback received, these do appear to be edge cases. They happen infrequently and require that something unexpected goes wrong in the porting process. Generally, the error is linked to updating routing information for the number being ported. Unfortunately, the isolated nature of such number porting errors means they are notoriously difficult to get support for. “All networks receive notification that a number has ported out of a certain network, requiring the routing to be updated,” Vodacom told MyBroadband. “In this particular instance, there was a delay in the routing from Vodacom to Telkom.” In the event that something goes wrong during a port, subscribers have no choice but to log the problem with the customer care centres of the networks involved. Vodacom said users can also contact it to effect the necessary routing changes to pre-empt any problems with a port. “Ports are executed between 19:30 and 22:00 on weekdays, while the port support department closes at 18:00 on weekdays,” said Vodacom. “Customers can contact customer care on weekends and after 18:00 on weekdays for assistance. The consultants in customer care will log calls to the port team which will be looked into the next morning, apart from Sundays.” Telkom did not respond to requests for comment on this story.
