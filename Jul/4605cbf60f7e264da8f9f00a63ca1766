Amazon CloudFront has announced four new Edge locations across four cities, including Cape Town in South Africa. The Edge location in Cape Town is the second in the country, with the first launched in Johannesburg last month. The rollout of the Edge locations will improve the availability and performance of content delivery to users in both Cape Town and Johannesburg. Following the launch of the new Edge servers in South Africa, Amazon said that customers delivering content in South Africa are seeing up to 75% latency improvements. Africa still remains the continent with the fewest number of Edge locations which Amazon delivers cloud services to, and it is the only continent without Regional Edge Caches.
