A MyBroadband reader recently contacted us with a complaint about FNB – specifically, its banking app. The reader stated that every time he logged into the FNB banking app, he was greeted with a “just for you” offers page. The offers page detailed financial products he qualified for or that FNB wanted to punt. “This page shows all the offers that FNB tells you qualify for until you touch continue. This happens each and every time a user logs into the app,” said the reader. The reader said he did not want to navigate paste the offers screen every time he used the app, and contacted FNB to have it removed from his app profile. His attempts were unsuccessful, though, he said. He stated that he was first told that removing the promotional screen would see him lose the ability to receive eBucks. After he agreed to this, he was then told that the offers screen could not be removed from the app. Following the complaint, MyBroadband contacted FNB for feedback on the matter. FNB’s media team said that customers can temporarily disable “just for you” offers on the banking app and online banking by clicking on the offer and selecting the option “not interested”. “This temporarily removes the offer until a new batch is loaded,” said FNB. “To permanently disable the offers on all FNB digital channels, customers can contact the bank.” FNB stated that customers will not lose the ability to earn eBucks when they disable the offers. It added that is has contacted the MyBroadband reader to resolve the “miscommunication” on the matter.
