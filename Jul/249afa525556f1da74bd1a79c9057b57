10 years after the launch of its 24-hour news channel, eNCA has overhauled its news studio and broadcast programme. The news broadcaster will relaunch its news programming this week, complete with a new studio and overhauled shows. eNCA will also launch a new evening news programme presented by ex-Al Jazeera English broadcast journalist Jane Dutton – named Tonight with Jane Dutton. The eNCA relaunch will take effect from today, 16 July 2018, broadcasting from its new open-plan studio. The new studio sports a conference table in its centre with a massive dynamic LCD panel in the background. This main screen can display up to four video streams simultaneously, and is flanked by smaller LCD screens on the sides of the studio – one of which is a touchscreen display. A collection of teleprompters and cameras line the far side of the studio, along with ceiling-mounted cameras which can track presenters as they move around the set. eNCA said its new studio will allow for dynamic and engaging news broadcasts with greater variety between segments. Images from the refreshed eNCA studio launch event are below.
