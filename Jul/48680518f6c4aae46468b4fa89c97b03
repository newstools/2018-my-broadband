MTN recently launched new fixed-LTE packages, aimed at home users who want high-speed broadband connectivity. The MTN Made for Home deals start at R369 per month – for 15GB of Anytime data and 15GB of Night Express data – and go up to R1,469 per month for the top package. The LTE offering is sold as a fixed-location service, where the SIM, router, and location are linked. Customers must ask MTN if their areas – and respective network towers – are covered by the service, and then apply for a package. The new products from MTN follow the launch of Rain fixed-LTE deals through local ISPs, and Cell C launching similar packages. Telkom is arguably the most recognised player when it comes to fixed-LTE solutions, offering a variety of packages on its network. MyBroadband asked Jacqui O’Sullivan, Executive for Corporate Affairs at MTN SA, whether their Made for Home services were in response to other networks’ offerings, or if they spotted a growing need for fixed-LTE connectivity. “Made for Home was launched in response to a growing consumer need for high-speed home Internet connectivity, especially where customers have limited technology options available to them, in their specific suburbs,” said O’Sullivan. “With MTN’s significant investment into its network over the past three years, we now have the resulting accolades supporting MTN’s position of being SA’s fastest mobile network. Furthermore, in response to the customer demand, we have developed this product for a fixed home solution.” O’Sullivan said MTN is also in the process of developing a specific niche version of the product targeting business customers. “MTN will continue to develop products and services that are in response to our customers’ needs,” she added.
