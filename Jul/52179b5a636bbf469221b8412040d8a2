Uber is relaunching in Finland after laws that deregulate the taxi industry came into effect on 1 July 2018, TechCrunch reported. The company paused its ride-hailing services in Finland in July 2017 while it waited for the new laws to be implemented. According to the report, the changes Finland has enacted include the removal of taxi permit caps and fare restrictions. “The objective of this reform is to promote the creation of new service models, ease market access, dismantle national regulation that limits competition, and reduce the level of public guidance,” the Finnish government stated. “An important aspect of the Act is that essential data on transport services can be made open. The Act will also lay down provisions for the interoperability of ticket and payment systems.” Uber will relaunch in the Helsinki capital region of Finland today. It is not restarting its unlicensed peer-to-peer service (UberPOP) in the market, however.
