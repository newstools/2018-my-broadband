Samsung smartphone owners have reported an issue with the company’s default texting application, which results in their photos being sent to random contacts without their authorisation. Users on Reddit and Samsung’s forums have reported that their photos are being sent to random contacts over the Samsung Messages app, and no record of the images being sent is shown. Affected users include Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ owners, with one S9+ owner stating that his smartphone sent his entire photo gallery to his girlfriend while he was sleeping. Users have theorised that the problems could be caused by the rollout of Rich Communications Service (RCS) on certain carriers in the US. Speaking to Gizmodo, Samsung said it was aware of the issue and its technical teams were looking into it. Concerned users can prevent their device from potentially sending their images to random contacts by revoking the Messages app’s storage access in their app settings menu, or switching to a different SMS application like Android Messages.
