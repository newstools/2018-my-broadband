I told my girlfriend I was buying an Amazon Echo smart speaker on Prime Day. “… and then I can tell Alexa to find us a good restaurant and ask what the weather will be there,” was the end of my purchase explanation to her. “Who’s Alexa?” she asked. “Alexa is Amazon’s smart assistant – like Siri for Apple, or Google Assistant,” I replied. “I don’t like that. It sounds like a stripper’s name. You must change its name to Bob,” she said. “So I should contact Amazon and ask them to stop what they are doing with their assistant software, and instruct them to change Alexa to Bob,” I asked. “Yes,” she replied. Amazon has not replied to my email as yet.
