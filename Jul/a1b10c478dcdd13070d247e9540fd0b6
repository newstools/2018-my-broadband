Business telecoms provider BitCo has adjusted the rates for its fibre packages ranging from 10Mbps to 150Mbps. The new price for BitCo’s 10Mbps corporate fibre package is now R2,995 per month. All of BitCo’s corporate fibre packages are uncapped, uncontended, synchronous, and uphold a guarantee of 99% operational uptime. Speeds start at 10Mbps and go up to 1Gbps, on either a 24 or 36-month contract. The company said its network expansion and increased coverage have allowed it to lower the prices of its fibre packages. “Our growth, network expansion, and increased coverage has reached a point where we can comfortably lower our fibre pricing,” said BitCo chief sales officer Michael Colin. BitCo also plans to bundle its network security solutions with its business fibre packages to offer a holistic solution to clients.
