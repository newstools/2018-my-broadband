Jannie van Zyl is well-known as one of the pioneers behind Vodacom’s 3G launch in December 2004, as the former CEO of iBurst, and as the current head of innovation at Vodacom. He also owns one of the largest private computer restoration operations in South Africa, and his house was named as one of the best automated homes in the world. Van Zyl’s love for PCs started in 1978 when he received his first computer – a Compukit UK-101 with a 1MHz 6502 CPU, 4KB of RAM, and 1KB of display memory – when he was 14. Fast forward four decades, and van Zyl decided to make his childhood dreams come true by restoring the computers which he always wanted to own. Instead of buying restored computers on sites like eBay, van Zyl joined an active local vintage computing community in South Africa – where members help each other to get machines and parts.
