Samsung’s “The Wall” TV, which was unveiled at CES 2018, is set to be put into production in September 2018. The 146-inch 4K TV features MicroLED technology, and offers dark blacks and bright whites, said Samsung at its launch. Now, Samsung display president Han Jong-Hee has stated the company will start producing a “thinner consumer version” of The Wall in 2019, reported Engadget. It will be 30mm thick compared to 80mm for The Wall, and “the price will not be as high as people think”, stated the report. Samsung’s MicroLED technology used in the display is also being developed further to compete against OLED tech from Sony and LG, which the report stated currently offers the best picture quality for consumer TVs.
