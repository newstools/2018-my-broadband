Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter have partnered to develop a standard to move data between platforms – called the Data Transfer Project. It is an open source initiative dedicated to developing tools that will let you transfer your data directly from one service to another, Google stated in a blog post. “The organisations involved with this project are developing tools that can convert any service’s proprietary APIs to and from a small set of standardised data formats that can be used by anyone,” said Google. “So far, we have developed adapters for seven different service providers across five different types of consumer data; we think this demonstrates the viability of this approach to scale to a large number of use cases.” According to Google, consumers will benefit from improved flexibility and control over their data. End-users will be able to import their information into any participating service using cloud-based infrastructure rather than their own potentially-limited bandwidth and capability to transfer files.
