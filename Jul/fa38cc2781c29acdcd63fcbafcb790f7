iFixit has revealed that the new Apple MacBook Pro laptops feature a silicon membrane under each key, explaining why the keyboards are quieter than previous models. These membranes also function as a layer of protection against dust and other particles. Reports from several MacBook owners whose devices use Apple’s new butterfly switch design suggest the keys are prone to sticking and breaking when dust gets underneath them. This has led to class action lawsuits against Apple regarding the issue. Apple recently confirmed that keyboards in recent MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops may encounter issues with sticking or broken keys, and introduced a free repair programme to address the issue. The free repair programme is honoured in South Africa by Apple Authorised Service Centres such as Digicape and iStore. Apple has denied that the changes to the MacBook Pro keyboard were to address reliability issues, and told The Verge the problems with the keyboard only affected a small fraction of users. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
