The already-affordable mini powerhouse, which forms part of Datsun’s collection of zippy vehicles, comes fully equipped with a trip computer, power steering, air conditioning, front electric windows, and a USB port. The interior and exterior of the Go Lux is both unique and enticing, with contemporary twists incorporated into a classic design – and despite its compact-build, the cabin feels quite spacious and open, further adding to its magic. This ideal little run-around is also perfectly suited to a first-time car owner or someone looking for a city car that can sneak through traffic, and squeeze into a parking on bustling streets. This small city slicker happens to be the star of this month’s Bidvest McCarthy special. The Datsun Go Lux 1.2 Demo is now going for only R109,900, while a brand new Datsun Go Lux 1.2 is available from only R1,782 per month.
