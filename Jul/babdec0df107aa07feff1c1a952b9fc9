Netflix has launched a new design for its TV interface, called App Menu, which aims to offer simpler and easier browsing. The new design will roll out to Netflix subscribers around the world from today, and is built specifically for the restricted navigation experience when using a TV remote. Netflix has added a number of features, including overhauling its search functionality to make it easier for viewers to find specific shows and the latest releases. App Menu also makes it simpler for viewers to browse series and movies, and allows users to access titles they have saved for later viewing in a My List menu. “While this may feel like an obvious update to some, validating that this TV experience was better for our members took extensive research, testing, and technology improvements,” said Netflix. “Much like how introducing video previews to the TV experience a few years ago helped cut down on how much time members spent browsing, this new design is one of many improvements we will be rolling out to make Netflix even better for our members around the world.”
