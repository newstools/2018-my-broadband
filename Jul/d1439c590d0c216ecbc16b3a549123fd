Apple recently refreshed its MacBook Pro range of computers to support Intel’s eighth-generation of 6-core processors, 32GB RAM, and the Apple T2 Chip. Its 15-inch model can also be upgraded to have an Intel Core i9 processor. A top-of-the-line MacBook Pro 15-inch with a 2.9GHz Intel Core i9 CPU, 32GB of RAM, Radeon Pro 560X, and 4TB of SSD storage retails for $6,699 on Apple’s US store. However, according to tests by YouTuber Dave Lee, the chassis and cooling system of the MacBook Pro is not able to effectively dissipate the heat from the Core i9 CPU. Lee said he performed a comparison of video rendering times in Adobe Premiere Pro, and the results showed that the 15-inch MacBook Pro from 2017 with a Core i7 CPU rendered the video faster than this year’s model with an i9 CPU. When the newer MacBook Pro was placed in a freezer, it outperformed last year’s model by a significant margin.
