Microsoft has confirmed problems with the July 2018 Security and Quality Rollup updates for .NET Framework, according to a report by Softpedia. The report stated that the updates may cause app crashes after they are installed. Microsoft issued an advisory on the matter, in which it detailed potential problems with apps not working, or failing to start. “These patches have been released to all supported Windows versions, including Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10. All versions of Windows 10 are affected as well, including the April 2018 Update,” stated the report. Microsoft has subsequently pulled the updates, and recommended that users uninstall the patches as a fix. “If you installed the July 2018 update and have not yet seen any negative behaviour, we recommend that you leave your systems as-is, but closely monitor them and ensure that you apply upcoming .NET Framework updates,” said Microsoft.
