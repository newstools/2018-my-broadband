Tron plans to roll out a system of cryptocurrency rewards for people who seed torrents, the founder of the Tron protocol Justin Sun said in a statement. Sun said they are exploring the possibility of using the Tron protocol to improve the BitTorrent protocol, to make BitTorrent faster and lengthen the lifespan of BitTorrent swarms. “I hope the integration of Tron and BitTorrent will allow both parties to work better as one in the future,” said Sun. He said that by integrating the Tron network into BitTorrent, they aim to improve on the altruism which exists in the network. “At this point, there are no incentives for peers who have completed downloading to continue to seed. We intend to extend rewards to peers who seed torrents, infusing more resources into the torrent ecosystem.” “Hundreds of millions of BitTorrent users across the globe will become a part of the Tron ecosystem. BitTorrent will be the largest application on the Tron network, which will allow Tron to surpass Ethereum on daily transactions and become the most influential public blockchain in the world.”
