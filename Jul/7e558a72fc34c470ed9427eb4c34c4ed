Absa has launched its new logo, following BusinessTech discovering the refreshed design. The new logo is displayed in the headline image above. The logo now sports a circular shape and a new shade of red – along with a new font. The change will be most notable in the group’s African operations, where it has been trading under the Barclays brand, reported BusinessTech. This week also marks the shift of the bank from trading as Barclays Africa Limited to Absa Bank Limited. While Barclays is no longer part of the Absa brand, it remains a partner in the group. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
