The United Kingdom announced it will construct a vertical launch spaceport in Sutherland, on the north coast of Scotland. Scotland is the best place in the UK to reach satellite orbits with vertically-launched rockets, and the UK Space Agency will pay £2.5 million to Highlands and Islands Enterprise to develop the vertical launch site. The site will reportedly use a combination of proven and cutting-edge technologies, and aims to deliver a leading spaceflight platform. “As a nation of innovators and entrepreneurs, we want Britain to be the first place in mainland Europe to launch satellites as part of our Industrial Strategy,” said Business Secretary Greg Clark. “The UK’s thriving space industry, research community, and aerospace supply chain put the UK in a leading position to develop both vertical and horizontal launch sites.” UK Space Agency chief executive Graham Turnock said the spaceport will mark the beginning of a new era for the UK space industry.
