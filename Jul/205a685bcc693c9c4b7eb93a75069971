I do not pay my TV licence and I do not plan to. Well, unless I go buy a new TV and no one will lend me theirs. The SABC and its debt collectors must have the best SMS package in town, however, because they have not given up on me yet. Every day for the past few months, I get an SMS from some agency stating I must pay my TV licence. Sometimes the messages are kind and encouraging, along the lines of “You can pay quick and easily here. Go on, we know you can do it, we believe in you”. Other times they are more threatening. “You have not paid and we told you to pay and this is your last warning, so pay now.” The amounts I owe have increased, too. The standard licence fee is R265 per year, but the amount I owed last month was R344.50. And for those of you who think you can block the senders’ numbers to stop receiving the SMS reminders to pay, good luck. As of the end of July 2018, the amount I owe on my TV licence is now R477, but the SABC has a plan to keep me from balking at the inflated amount – a prize. The latest SMS I received from the SABC, its debt collectors, or whoever sends them these days, stated that if I paid my TV licence, I could win a Samsung Galaxy S9. MR [Name], #MBD #SamsungS9Promo. To enter our exciting competition, sign up for a debit order and settle your TV Licence arrears of R477.00 in July, OR split the payment over July and August 2018. Samsung S9 to be WON! MBD tel (011)560-4633. Ref: [Number]. Ts&Cs apply While the offer has not tempted me to pay, we must at least recognise that they picked a cool smartphone as a temptation. When it comes time to buy a new TV, or I start using any of the SABC’s services, I will pay my TV licence. Until then, some other lucky customer can take the S9 home. This is an opinion piece.
