MTN has launched new fixed-LTE packages, called Made For Home. The new products are made for use as a home Internet solution, “specifically designed for use within a fixed location”. “MTN Made For Home is an easy-to-use, plug-and-play solution that requires only a router and a SIM card,” said Jacqui O’Sullivan, Executive for Corporate Affairs at MTN South Africa. MTN has launched four MTN Made for Home price plans, detailed below. All packages are bundled with a Sh@relink B612 device, said the company. MTN Made For Home customers will also have access to a range of bolt-on bundles – starting from 2GB at R69, to 100GB at R999.
