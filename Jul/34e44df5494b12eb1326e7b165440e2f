With 95 octane petrol topping the R16 mark this week, there are many unhappy motorists around. Whether it’s the prospect of another big petrol price hike in August, or the fact that a large chunk of per-litre prices go to failing government agencies, filling up is becoming less pleasant. To see how the latest price hike fits into the greater scheme of things, we looked at the AA’s historic fuel price index. The AA has pricing data for petrol and diesel in South Africa dating back to 2008, which can be used to provide an overview of the increases over time. As shown in the graph below, the price of petrol has steadily increased over the past 10 years, with a few sharp rises and drops along the way. While a jump from R14.42 in January 2018 to R16.02 in July 2018 is substantial, it does not compare to the price movement in 2008 and 2009. In January 2008, 95 octane petrol in Gauteng was R7.47. By July that year, it was R10.70. It then dropped to R6.01 in January 2009. The graph below shows the price of 95 unleaded petrol in Gauteng over the past 10 years.
