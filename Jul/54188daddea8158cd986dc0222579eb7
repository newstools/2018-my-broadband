Cell C and GloCell have successfully finalised an agreement which will see GloCell cede its Cell C contract customer base to Cell C. GloCell was previously appointed as a service agent for Cell C customers, which were migrated from Altech Autopage in 2016. The integration of GloCell customers into Cell C’s systems will be completed by mid-July, with the service agent continuing to service customers in the interim. Cell C said it has measures in place to ensure GloCell receives adequate support, and that customers should expect normal service to continue. “We are excited to welcome GloCell contract customers to Cell C and believe this will result in a positive customer experience with Cell C’s extensive distribution and service network now available to these customers,” said Cell C CEO Jose Dos Santos. “We would like to thank GloCell for the care they have taken with these customers as a service agent and we look forward to their support in integrating the customer base into Cell C.” “To ensure the best possible experience for customers, ceding these contract subscribers back to Cell C was the best thing to do, as was the case with similar service provision businesses in the past,” said GloCell CEO Shaun Prithivirajh.
