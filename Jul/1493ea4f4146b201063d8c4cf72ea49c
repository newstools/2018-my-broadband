Steam has started rolling out its overhauled chat system to all users on its platform. The new chat systems brings a variety of chat tools which aim to improve the social experience on Steam, and compete with applications like Discord. Steam unveiled its new chat features in June 2018, allowing users to opt in to a beta version of the system. Within the overhauled system, in-game friends are grouped by the game they are playing – and persistent group chats allow users to host a dedicated voice channel for their friends. Users can also invite friends to groups by sending a URL to them, which will automatically add them to the group. Steam’s new chat interface is available in the standalone client and on the Steam website.
