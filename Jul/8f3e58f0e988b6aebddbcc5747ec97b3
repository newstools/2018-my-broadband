Parliament plans to give its secretary free business class flights and five-star hotel stays – at taxpayers’ expense. This is according to a report in the Sunday Times, which stated that the proposal is part of a new draft policy document. The perks will benefit Parliament secretary Gengezi Mgidlana, who is currently on suspension for “wasting taxpayers’ money during domestic and international travel with his wife”, stated the Sunday Times. He reportedly spent R4 million in two years on these trips, and irregularly awarded himself a bursary. The draft policy document also proposes that Mgidlana and other top Parliament staff be given top-level security clearances. Moloto Mothapo, Parliament spokesperson, said the document was not final. The proposed policies would also have to be approved by the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, and the NCOP. In a previous report on Mgidlana’s suspension, it was stated that he ordered parliamentary officials to drive him around in cars fitted with blue lights. He also allegedly instructed drivers to drive at 160km/h and skip red lights.
