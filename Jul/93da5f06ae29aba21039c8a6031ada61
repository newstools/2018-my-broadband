Two people have allegedly hacked a fuel pump in Detroit allowing over 600 gallons (2,271.25 litres) of petrol to be stolen over the course of an hour and a half, Gizmodo reported. The fuel’s value was about $1,800 (R24,000). According to the report, at least 10 cars scored from the unlocked petrol pump. The hackers apparently used a kind of remote device which let them hijack the pump and prevent the gas station employee from shutting it down. Gizmodo inferred that the attackers likely targeted the petrol station’s fuel management software, citing reports from TrendMicro and Motherboard. Many fuel management systems include web-based interfaces, which TrendMicro reported are relatively easy to find online using the search tool Shodan. TrendMicro also found that several systems were not password protected.
