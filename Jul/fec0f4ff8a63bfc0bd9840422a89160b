Employees affiliated with CWU, DEPACU, and SACU have “shut down” the South African Post Office. The striking workers, who are also from Telkom, have embarked on their strike over a pay increase for communications workers. The workers embarked on joint strike action on 6 July 2018, resulting in Post Office branches around the country closing their doors and being unable to service grant beneficiaries. Workers from Telkom and the Post Office are gathering at the Mary Fitzgerald Square in Johannesburg and are demanding a 12% wage increase from Telkom and SAPO. The union workers will also march through Johannesburg. The Post Office has advised grant recipients queuing outside branches to instead draw their cash at ATMs.
