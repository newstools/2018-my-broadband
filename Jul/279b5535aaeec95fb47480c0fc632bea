The Pirate Bay has brought back its controversial cryptocurrency mining script which uses the CPUs of visitors to mine cryptocurrency, TorrentFreak reported. This follows reports from September 2017 that the torrent index had implemented a cryptocurrency mining script on certain pages without notifying visitors or providing a way to opt out. Cloudflare issued a strong statement against the cryptojacking and banned sites from its platform who secretly embeded cryptocurrency miners. The Pirate Bay removed its Coinhive mining script, re-enabled it in October, then disabled it again. It has now implemented a new system, which appears to be the web miner Crypto Loot. Visitors have complained that their processors are running hot when they frequent The Pirate Bay, and an inspection of the script implementation reveals it is set to consume more CPU cycles than The Pirate Bay configured its previous mining scripts for. This time, it has set the throttle to 0.9 (or 90%). In the past, The Pirate Bay used throttle rates of between 0.6 and 0.8.
