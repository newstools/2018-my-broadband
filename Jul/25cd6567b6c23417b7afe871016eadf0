Spotify has launched its Discover Weekly feature in South Africa. Discover Weekly is a personalised playlist that is updated every Monday morning, aimed at helping users find new music and artists. “With over 35 million tracks and over 2 billion playlists available on Spotify, there is something for everyone,” said Spotify. The service creates a playlist of new music and artists every week based on your listening habits. Spotify stated that the recommendations from Discover Weekly become better when you create your own playlists. It also takes into account the tracks you’ve skipped or loved, and how frequently you listen to a specific track or artist. Spotify launched in South Africa on 12 March 2018. At the time, it stated Discover Weekly playlists would be available immediately.
