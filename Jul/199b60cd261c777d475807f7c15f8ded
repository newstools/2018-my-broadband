Samsung has launched its “ultimate screen for multitasking” in South Africa, the CJ89. The Samsung CJ89 is available in two sizes, 49-inch and 43-inch, with the larger model already available in the country. The 43-inch version will launch at the end of September 2018. Pricing for the monitors will range between R20,000 to R23,000 locally. Samsung said the 49-inch model, with a 32:9 wide-screen design, is the equivalent of two 27-inch monitors side-by-side, and is aimed at business users. The display also features an 1,800R curvature, which is intended to lessen the strain on the user’s eyes. “The CJ89 can be divided into either two 16:9 screens, or 21:9 and 11:9 screens. With Samsung’s Easy Setting Box software, you can choose from a variety of layouts,” said Samsung. Other standout specifications include a 3,840×1,080 resolution, and a 144Hz refresh rate. It includes built-in KVM switch, USB-Type C ports, and built-in stereo speakers, added Samsung.
