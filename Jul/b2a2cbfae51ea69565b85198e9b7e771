Google is moving closer to implementing its Material Design user interface in its Chrome browser. The company has rolled out an update to Chrome Canary on Windows, Linux, and Chrome OS which activates the new design by default. Chrome Canary is a version of Chrome designed for developers and early adopters, and allows users to test new features under active development. The redesigned browser sports a new address bar, overhauled tab shapes and colours, and new alert indicators – as seen in the image below. There is currently no information available regarding the rollout of Chrome’s redesigned UI to mainstream users, but the release of a Chrome Canary version means that everyday Chrome users could receive the overhauled UI in the near future.
