A coalition of international video entertainment companies has approached the Federal Court in Australia to apply for an injunction against 151 domains connected to 77 alleged pirate websites, Computerworld reported. The companies are Village Roadshow Films, Disney, Twentieth Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Columbia Pictures, Universal, Warner Bros, Television Broadcasts Limited, and Madman Entertainment. If granted, the injunction will be the widest-reaching in Australia in terms of the number of online services targeted. TorrentFreak described it as “record-setting.” According to the report, this is the first time Vodafone is listed as a respondent in such an injunction since its entry into Australia’s fixed-line market in 2017. Other ISPs listed as respondents include Telstra, Optus, Vocus, and TPG. ISPs will receive AUD$50 per domain blocked to help cover their costs, and may choose whether to block the domains at their DNS, using the URL or IP address, and through re-routing. They may use alternative methods, too, as long as the Hollywood studios agree to them.
