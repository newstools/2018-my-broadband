Backup solutions provider Backblaze has released its hard drive reliability statistics for Q2 2018. Backblaze compared hard drives used in its operations – from Seagate, Western Digital, Toshiba, and HGST – for the report. Reliability was measured as an annualised failure rate, calculated using the number of drive failures relative to the number of drives. Backblaze then recorded the failure rates of its hard drives from 1 April to 30 June 2018, along with the annualised failure rate. The company had 100,254 mechanical drives as of 30 June 2018, 1,989 of which were boot drives and 98,625 of which were data drives. Backblaze actively monitored 98,265 drives throughout Q2 2018, removing models without at least 45 drives present from the data. Drives used for testing purposes were also removed from the data set. The results of its report are detailed below.
