Rain Mobile customers who have a bill of R129.04 on their dashboard, do not fret. Rain users contact MyBroadband this morning stating they had a bill of R129.04 on their accounts, despite not using Rain Mobile peak-time data. These users had activated the Rain Mobile unlimited data add-on, and had only used data during the allocated 19 hours which the add-on provides. Today is the first day of proper billing for Rain Mobile users who purchased SIM-only packages, following unlimited data usage in June and the first 15 days of July, and there were concerns a billing issue had arisen. A Rain spokesperson told MyBroadband, however, that the R129.04 bill users have seen is a pro-rata charge for their R250 unlimited data add-on. This was communicated to them via email. The amount is reflective of the charge for the add-on, taking into account that it was only activated with two weeks left in the July billing window. “If a customer has unlimited off-peak selected, we will indicate the pro-rata amount, which will be due by the end of the month. We have also communicated this to customers over the weekend,” said Rain.
