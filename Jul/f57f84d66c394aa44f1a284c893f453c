Facebook is in talks with Cristiano Ronaldo to produce a reality series for Facebook Watch, Variety reported. Citing multiple sources, the report said Facebook is prepared to invest a significant sum in the project – with Ronaldo potentially earning $10 million for a 13-episode series. The show is reportedly being packaged by CAA, and produced by Matador Content and Religion of Sports. Variety said its sources differed on how far along the discussions were, with one saying the deal is nearly finalised. Ronaldo is the biggest sports star on Facebook with more than 120 million followers on his official page. He is also already in business with Facebook after the social media giant ordered an original scripted drama series from Wiip, the new studio he launched with Paul Lee. According to the report, the show will be about a diverse high-school girls soccer team in upstate New York.
