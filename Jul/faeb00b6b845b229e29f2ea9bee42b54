Vodacom has stated that its roaming agreement with Rain is “an important mechanism” to handle future data demand on the network. Vodacom, as part of its trading update for the quarter ended 30 June 2018, added that the Competition Commission and ICASA have approved its roaming deal with Rain. “In 2016, Vodacom and Rain announced agreements for facilities leasing, services, and Vodacom roaming on Rain’s network,” said Vodacom. “Rain signed facilities leasing and services agreements with Vodacom, in order to lease passive network infrastructure from Vodacom – which they require to roll out a 4G network. Vodacom signed a roaming agreement with Rain, whereby Vodacom customers will be able to roam on Rain’s 4G network.” Vodacom said the benefit is that it can improve the experience for its customers by offloading data traffic onto Rain’s network. “This is an important mechanism to manage future demand for data services, which would have otherwise been challenging in a potentially spectrum-constrained environment,” said Vodacom. The Competition Commission and ICASA have reviewed the agreement, and approved the deal between Vodacom and Rain.
