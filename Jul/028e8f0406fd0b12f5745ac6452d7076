Volkswagen plans to launch a car-sharing service exclusively for electric vehicles next year, TechCrunch reported. The service is named WE and is set to launch in Germany in 2019, expanding to major cities in Europe, North America, and Asia in 2020. WE will initially focus on electric car sharing, but will eventually expand to include other types of vehicles – such as electric scooters. VW said the platform will allow users to rent vehicles like electric scooters, connect to a car-sharing service, and pay for parking in major cities. It will also work on connecting the platform with MOIA, the automaker’s mobility platform which recently launched a ride-sharing service. The WE platform will be managed by Urban Mobility International, which is a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group.
