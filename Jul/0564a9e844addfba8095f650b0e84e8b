The price of petrol has gone up once again, according to a Fin24 report. The Department of Energy has stated that the 93 and 95 grades of petrol will go up by 26c and 23c a litre respectively on 4 July 2018. This means that 95 octane petrol will cost: Diesel 0.05% sulphur will go up by 26c per litre, while diesel 0.005% sulphur goes up by 24c. The maximum retail price for LPGAS will increase by 37c per kilogram. This follows messages on social media this week calling on South Africans to shut down all major roads in protest over petrol price hikes and VAT increases.
