A UK court has sentenced the owner of Evolution Trading to five years and three months in prison, after he was found to have sold 8,000 pirate set-top boxes running XBMC (Kodi). The media boxes provided access to a subscription IPTV service which streamed pirated content, TorrentFreak reported. The business ran from March 2013 to July 2015. Evolution Trading was registered to John Haggerty and his wife, and the court found that she played a minor role in the IPTV business – handing down a suspended sentence of two years and 200 hours of labour. During the period the business ran, it generated at least £764,000 from the sale of set-top boxes, which were carried out from a shop and online marketplaces such as eBay and Amazon. The devices sold for between £75 and £100 to the public, and £400 to pubs. Haggerty also created an IPTV service which was bundled with the boxes called Infusum.tv, which they sold for £15 per month. According to a report by Chronicle Live, he had several passports in different names, and set up a company in Nevis to hide Evolution’s true purpose. The company was registered at the couple’s former home address with the stated purpose to “wholesale of coffee, tea, cocoa and spices.” In handing down the sentence, the court stated that it was a “very sophisticated fraud”, for which Haggerty was primarily responsible.
