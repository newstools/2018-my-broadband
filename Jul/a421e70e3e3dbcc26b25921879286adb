Media24 and HuffPost (previously known as The Huffington Post) have announced they will mutually end the South African licence for the publication. HuffPost South Africa was launched in November 2016 under Media24, with the South African media company driving the commercial operations of the partnership. Media24 CEO Esmaré Weideman said that creating advertising revenue through HuffPost SA has been difficult. “We regularly review our portfolio of brands. The HuffPost SA audience numbers are strong and consistently hold steady on the list of top-10 news sites in South Africa,” said Weideman. “Advertising revenues for HuffPost in South Africa have, however, been challenging,” she said. According to Effective Measure, HuffPost SA was ranked the ninth-biggest news site in South Africa in June 2018, with a readership of 1.63 million unique users. 24.com CEO Andreij Horn said staff at the affected news site are being consulted. Jared Grusd, CEO of HuffPost, said: “We are proud of the editorial work and journalism from the South African edition and commend its ability to scale a loyal audience in such a short period of time.” “We continue to invest and grow HuffPost’s capabilities and audience, both globally and in the African continent.”
