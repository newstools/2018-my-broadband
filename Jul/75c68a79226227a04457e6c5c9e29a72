Google has launched Move Mirror, an AI experiment which matches your real-time movements to hundreds of images of people doing similar poses around the world. “It feels like a magical mirror that reflects your moves with images of all kinds of human activity – from sports and dance to martial arts, acting, and beyond,” said Google. “You can even capture the experience as a GIF and share it with your friends.” The pose estimation is done using Tensorflow.js, a JavaScript library for machine learning developed by the Google Brain team – which can be run in your browser. This means the pose estimation happens directly in the browser, and your images are not being stored or sent to a server. Google has also published a full technical explanation of how it built the experiment in a blog post.
