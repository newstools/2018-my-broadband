Vodacom will launch new 200Mbps fibre-to-the-home products in the coming weeks, doubling its current peak speed of 100Mbps. This is according to Gary Hart, executive head: managed network and unified communications at Vodacom Business, who was speaking at the 2018 MyBroadband Fibre Conference. Hart said there is a strong demand for faster connectivity in South Africa, which includes demand from smaller cities and towns. Vodacom has fibre coverage in major SA provinces, including Gauteng, the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, the Eastern Cape, and the Free State. Hart said Vodacom continues to roll out fibre in these areas and is also focusing on outlying regions – such as Nelspruit, Witbank, and Polokwane. While the preferred connectivity method for consumers is almost always fibre, Hart said there are other technologies which can fill gaps in the broadband market. He said consumers require a service – in this case fast and stable connectivity – and that fixed-wireless technologies can fulfil these needs in certain cases. Hart said Vodacom currently has over 18,000 fixed-wireless customers who are very happy with the service which they receive. These customers are served through a variety of wireless technologies, including microwave and LTE-A.
