Buying a processor for your new gaming PC does not have to be an expensive purchase. Unless you plan on playing titles in 4K, streaming to Twitch, or multitasking heavily on the same PC, you can get away with using a cheaper chip that boasts great performance. The best products to consider are newer-generation CPUs which offer high core counts and decent clock speeds, as these should be able to handle the demands of most modern video games. They also have the advantage of drawing less power than more expensive chips, allowing you to use a slightly more power-hungry GPU. Using data from the PassMark CPUMark benchmarking database and comparing performance, we selected the best AMD and Intel processors you can purchase for under R2,500 for gaming. Only recent-generation processors were included in this comparison, as the value proposition of desktop chips increases with every new product generation. This makes it unwise to purchase older-generation processors unless you can get a large discount on the CPU. Below are five great gaming processors you can buy for under R2,500 in South Africa, along with their specifications.  To rank these CPUs for gaming, benchmark data for the processors was taken from PassMark Software’s PerformanceTest benchmarking software. This software suite includes CPUMark, which measures the mathematical operations, compression, encryption, and physics capabilities of a processor. We used these scores to rank the AMD and Intel processors based on their expected performance, and the average benchmark scores for the sub-R2,500 processors are below.
