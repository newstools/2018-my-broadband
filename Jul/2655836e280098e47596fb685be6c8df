MTN customers in South Africa have reported that Facebook Messenger no longer uses mobile data. Customers reported that sending or receiving messages did not consume their mobile data, but they were presented with a warning that data charges will still apply when viewing a user’s Facebook profile. MyBroadband tested mobile data usage for Facebook Messenger on MTN and found that standard messages were zero-rated. We were also presented with a splash screen upon installing and opening the app, detailing the specifics of the zero-rated service. According to the screen, messages, emojis, and stickers can be sent and received in Facebook Messenger without incurring data charges. A screenshot of the splash screen for MTN users is below.  Following questions from MyBroadband, MTN Executive for Corporate Affairs Jacqui O’Sullivan confirmed the mobile operator was testing a service to offer zero-rated Facebook Messenger usage to customers. “MTN SA in collaboration with Facebook is currently running a pilot on Facebook AutoFlex service,” said O’Sullivan. “Facebook AutoFlex as a service to customers gives MTN customers access to a text-only Facebook experience when they have a zero balance on their accounts.” O’Sullivan noted that users would still pay to send images, videos, and other files through the platform. “The trial includes access to free text-only Messenger for all MTN customers with balance or zero balance,” she said. “It is important to note that customers will be charged for any multimedia content shared through Messenger.”
