MyBroadband Forum members have spotted that Telkom’s website is not working as it should. If you access the website using the URL – http://telkom.co.za/ – you are presented with a plain white page, with the words “Hello World” at the top. The page does not redirect to Telkom’s active website, as one would expect. Further investigation found that using the URL – www.telkom.co.za – takes users to the Telkom website, but not an “https” secure version – leaving a user’s browser stating that their connection to the site is not secure. Navigating to – https://telkom.co.za/ – does not take you to the site at all. Rather, your browser presents a warning page that the connection to the site is not secure, and that attackers may be trying to steal your information. Using the address – https://www.telkom.co.za/today – however, takes you to the website and the connection is stated as secure. Searching for Telkom in Google and using the top result link takes users to – www.telkom.co.za/today – which is the working website, but the browser states is not served over a secure connection. All the tests above were done using the Chrome browser. The reason for the discrepancies when using different URLs may be a result of misconfigured site redirections. Telkom was asked for comment, but did not immediately reply to questions.  Thanks to saor and the MyBroadband Forum members for showing us the glitch.
