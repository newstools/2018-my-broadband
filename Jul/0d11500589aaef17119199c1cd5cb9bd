The New Zealand court of appeal has ruled that Kim Dotcom can be extradited to the US to face criminal charges, Reuters reported. This follows the ruling of a Wellington court which found that the attorney general broke the law by refusing Dotcom’s request to be given all the information about him held by public agencies. Dotcom argued that the outcome of a case before the Human Rights Review Tribunal may be relevant to his extradition case, and the details he requested could be presented as evidence. The court of appeal has now upheld a lower court ruling from 2017 which found that the extradition could take place. Dotcom will now make a final appeal to the Supreme Court, the highest judicial body in New Zealand. “My legal team are confident that the Supreme Court will hear the appeal, given there are such significant legal issues at stake,” Dotcom said in a statement. He said the precedent set is concerning, and has ramifications in New Zealand outside of his case. Dotcom is set to face racketeering and copyright infringement charges in the US, but his lawyers have argued that copyright infringement is not a criminal offence in New Zealand. The US has requested the extradition of Dotcom after the FBI raided his mansion and shut down his Megaupload business in 2012. Authorities allege Dotcom has cost copyright holders over $175 million.
