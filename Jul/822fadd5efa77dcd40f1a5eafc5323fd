NASA has released a new toolkit which aims to improve access to its satellite data for use in commercial projects. NASA’s raw satellite data is widely available at no cost and includes petabytes of information collected by its Earth observation satellites. The agency’s new remote sensing toolkit will allow suers to quickly find, analyse, and apply the most relevant of this data for their own uses – whether they are conducting research or using the data for a business. “This new tool makes finding and using NASA satellite data easier than ever before, and we hope it sparks innovation among the entrepreneurial community and leads to further commercialisation of NASA technology and benefits people across the world,” said NASA Technology Transfer programme executive Daniel Lockney. NASA’s Technology Transfer programme will host tutorials to help acquaint users with the remote sensing toolkit.
