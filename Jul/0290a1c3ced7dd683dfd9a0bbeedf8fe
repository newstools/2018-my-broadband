Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos’s private space company, has successfully performed a landing of its New Shepard rocket booster and crew capsule. The company conducted a spaceflight test on 18 July 2018, launching the rocket into space and cleanly separating the booster and crew capsule – before both began their return to Earth. The New Shepard booster is designed to land similarly to SpaceX’s Falcon 9 reusable rocket, falling back down to Earth and using the last of its fuel to perform a powered landing at a landing zone. Meanwhile, Blue Origin’s crew capsule coasted into space and safely re-entered the atmosphere before deploying parachutes to land. The mission went according to plan, with both spacecraft landing safely at the end of the 11-minute mission. While Blue Origin aims to carry humans in its crew capsules, a mannequin was used in this mission.
