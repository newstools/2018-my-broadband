Apple’s next iPhone event could host the introduction of a 6.1-inch model, available in a range of bright colours borrowed from the iPhone 5c. The iPhone 5c range – pictured above – offered an array of bright colour options, including white, pink, yellow, blue, and green. A report by Softpedia stated that the new iPhone would feature an LCD screen, as opposed to the OLED display in the iPhone X, and would not have a dual rear camera – making it cheaper to produce. “Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has already suggested that Apple could choose white, gold, orange, grey, blue, and red for the new iPhone,” stated the report. Other colours listed as possibilities include yellow and black. The report speculated that the bright colours would be used so customers could differentiate between the new top-end iPhone set to launch later this year, and the cheaper 6.1-inch model. Pricing could be around $699, added the report.
