Virgin Money South Africa has launched its Online Buying platform, which gives consumers more innovative options when shopping for and securing car insurance. Customers now, not only have the option of using a call centre but can also go online and become fully insured in just 10 minutes. “While many South Africans are used to direct engagement with a call centre agent, an increasing number of consumers prefer using online application tools. Virgin Money Insurance believes that customers should have the ability to choose the sales channel most convenient to them,” says Andre Hugo, CEO of Virgin Money South Africa. This latest innovation addresses Virgin Money’s recent findings, which highlights that one of the biggest frustrations people face when buying car insurance is the feeling of being tossed back and forth within the context of a call centre. Some customers want to both source their quote and sign up online, then and there. “Many customers find the standard call centre process involved in buying car insurance quite tedious. Even when they have the option of going online for a quote, they still need to wait for someone to call them back. We want to take the pain of waiting away from the customer, not only saving them time, but also putting them in control,” says Hugo. With this in mind, Virgin Money Insurance now enables customers to go online and become fully insured – right from the request for a customised quote through to the actual purchase.
