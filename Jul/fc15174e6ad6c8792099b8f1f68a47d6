Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has issued a research note with TF Securities, predicting that new iPhones launching later this year will be available in dual-SIM variants, MacRumors reported. Kuo’s statement follows rumours that Apple will launch three new iPhones this year, including two iPhone X models. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty stated a cheaper iPhone, which will feature an LCD screen, will sell for between $699 and $769. Huberty said a new 6.5-inch OLED model will sell for $999, while a new 5.8-inch OLED model will start at $899. Kuo said he expects demand for the 6.5-inch OLED iPhone to be better than iPhone X, thanks in part to dual-SIM dual-standby functionality. The LCD iPhone is “expected to boost better-replacement demands than iPhone 8/8s did, due to being equipped with full-screen, Face ID, selling price lower than $700”.
