Microsoft will stop delta updates for Windows 10 from February 2019, according to a report by Softpedia. The report stated that Microsoft uses three types of updates for Windows 10 – full updates, express updates, and delta updates. From next year, only full and express updates will be used, with express updates used to deliver smaller files to devices. “Technically, there’s one major difference between delta and express updates: the latter are smaller in size thanks to the fact that they patch individual files and not the full component,” stated the report. The report added that a PC using express updates will determine optimal differentials, and will then only download what is needed for the system. “Ultimately, the more up to date a device is, the smaller the size of the differential download,” stated the report.
