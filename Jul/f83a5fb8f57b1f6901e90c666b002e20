Sony accidentally uploaded an entire film to its Sony Pictures YouTube channel this week instead of its trailer, CBR reported. The company intended to upload a trailer for its film “Khali the Killer” to its channel, but instead uploaded the entire one-and-a-half-hour movie. The YouTube video was titled “Khali the Killer: Official Red Band Trailer” and was available on the Sony Pictures YouTube channel for over five hours before being taken down and replaced with the trailer. YouTube commenters were quick to climb on the mistake, with one user commenting: “Trailer gave the whole plot away. Pass.” Another said: “It’s just the trailer, the whole movie will be 4 hours.” Khali the Killer is an action film about a Los Angeles hitman who develops empathy for the targets of his latest job, while caring for his ailing grandmother. The film is available for streaming exclusively on Vudu.
