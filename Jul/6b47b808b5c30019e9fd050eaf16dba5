Apple device owners are no strangers to being mocked. New MacBook Pro users are ridiculed for only having USB-C ports and needing to carry around a USB-A/HDMI/SD adapter with them. New iPhone owners are no different, with devices like the iPhone X ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack and only sporting a Lightning port. Despite iPhone owners receiving a headphone-jack-to-Lightning adapter with their devices, it did not stop the naysayers from having a laugh. It turns out that the only entity laughing now, however, may be Apple. According to statistics from Thinknum, the 3.5mm adapter – which sells for $9.99 – is the third-best-selling item at Best Buy, a large tech retailer in the US. According to the figures, the adapter has been a best-seller since it launched in 2016. The best-selling item is the Amazon’s Fire TV stick, while second place went to Apple’s AirPods, added the report.
