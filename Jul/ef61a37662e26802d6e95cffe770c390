A team of scientists has discovered a large body of subglacial liquid water on Mars. Evidence of a large body of liquid water underneath its polar icecaps was observed by a low-frequency radar instrument on the Mars Express spacecraft. The instrument detected bright subsurface reflections within a 20km-wide area at the planet’s south pole – which are in line with water-based materials. The data collected on the anomalous area is similar to readings taken on Earth, showing large bodies of water beneath polar deposits in Antarctica. The data was collected from May 2012 to December 2015, and is seen as a stable underground lake below the surface of Mars. Many scientists have speculated that a stable body of liquid water could be present beneath the Martian polar caps, but this is the first observation of the phenomenon.
