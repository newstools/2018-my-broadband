Microsoft has released a free version of its Teams professional communications platform. Teams – essentially Microsoft’s Slack competitor – previously required a monthly subscription to use the platform. While this approach was suitable for large enterprise customers, it could be a prohibitive cost for small businesses – who subsequently turned to free systems. The free version of Teams supports 300 users and a number of features present in the paid product, including: The free version allows for 2GB of file storage per user and 10GB of shared storage, notably less than the 1TB per user offered by the paid-for package. Microsoft’s free tier of Teams is available from the Office website.
