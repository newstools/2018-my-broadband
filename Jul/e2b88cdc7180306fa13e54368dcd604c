Mozilla’s latest Nightly build for Firefox includes an option to automatically mute audio which plays when a web page is opened. Firefox’s Nightly browser is updated frequently and allows users to test a variety of features which may not make it into the stable browser client. The Nightly releases can be unstable and feature a number of bugs, in addition to work-in-progress features destined for the main Firefox browser. Firefox Nightly’s automatic audio muting can be toggled on or off, and users can make exceptions for certain sites or force websites to ask for permission before autoplaying audio. It will be a while before this feature potentially rolls out to the stable Firefox browser, as it will need to launch on the Firefox beta and developer builds first and be tested further. We are adding the ability to block and configure autoplaying videos with sound in Firefox, can check it out in @FirefoxNightly today (comments welcome) pic.twitter.com/k9K9hQC9Ye — Dale Harvey (@daleharvey) July 21, 2018
