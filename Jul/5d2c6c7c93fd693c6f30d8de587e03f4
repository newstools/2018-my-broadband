The DA Shadow Minister of Police, Zakhele Mbhele, has revealed how many “close protectors” are employed by the Presidency. Based on a reply to a parliamentary question, Mbhele said the Presidential Protection Unit currently employs 1,382 personnel. These security personnel look after 17 individuals – who include current and former presidents, deputy presidents, and first ladies. This is a ratio of 81 protectors per person, said Mbhele. “These are truly astonishing numbers, considering that in Nyanga in the Western Cape the police-to-population ratio in 2018 is estimated at one police officer to every 628 residents,” said Mbhele. “It is an indictment on the ANC government that it can spend more than R690 million on the Presidential Protection Unit, yet the South African Police Services has for years remained chronically under-resourced.”
