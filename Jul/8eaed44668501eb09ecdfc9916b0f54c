After collecting enough pledges during an initial crowdfunding period, Sega will go ahead with the production of its Sonic toaster. The limited-edition toaster burns an image of Sonic the Hedgehog’s face onto a piece of bread after it is inserted. Sega has listed the toaster on its online store with a price tag of $35, and the tagline “Gotta Toast Fast!”. “Are you tired of the same old toast? Do you find yourself constantly on the go and need a quick breakfast before you head out to collect those rings?”, the product’s store page reads. “Well, do we have the toaster for you!” The Sonic toaster will ship to pre-order customers on 1 October 2018 and will be available in 29 countries, including the US, Canada, Australia and the UK.
