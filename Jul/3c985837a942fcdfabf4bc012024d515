Apple has listed a new external GPU on its website for use with MacBook Pro laptops, called the Blackmagic eGPU. The eGPU offers “desktop-class graphics performance on your MacBook Pro”, and features a Radeon Pro 580 with 8GB of GDDR5 memory. The device reportedly offers up to 2.8-times faster graphics performance on the 15-inch MacBook Pro, and 8-times faster performance on the 13-inch MacBook Pro. It is also reported to be the first eGPU to support Thunderbolt 3 displays like LG’s 5K monitor. Connectivity ports on the eGPU include two Thunderbolt 3, four USB 3.0, and one HDMI 2.0. The Blackmagic eGPU is currently available in the US for $699.
