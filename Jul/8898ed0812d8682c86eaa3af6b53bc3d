Samsung US has released a set of new adverts on YouTube showing the benefits of a Samsung Galaxy device over an Apple iPhone. The short videos, posted below, mock Apple devices for their lack of MicroSD slots, their inability to multitask with split-screen functionality, and the “notch” made popular by the iPhone X. The videos come at a time when both companies are reported to be working on their latest devices – with Samsung set to launch its Galaxy Note 9 in August 2018. Apple will reportedly release three new iPhone models later this year. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
