MTN Dubai, a subsidiary of MTN Group, has sold 100% of MTN Cyprus to Monaco Telecom. The sale forms part of an ongoing review of its portfolio, and the net proceeds of R4.1 billion go to MTN. This sale values MTN Cyprus at eight-times its reported EBITDA in 2017. MTN has also agreed to allow Monaco Telecom to use the MTN brand in Cyprus for up to three years in return for a commercial fee. MTN said its Cyprus entity is the company’s only operating business in the European Union and was obtained as part of MTN’s acquisition of Investcom in 2006. MTN said MTN Cyprus falls outside the group’s core footprint in Africa and the Middle East. The transaction is expected to close within the third quarter of 2018.
