Google is working on its own hardware security keys to aid in combating phishing attacks. The companyâ€™s device is called the Titan Key and will be available in two models, both of which are FIDO-compatible and can be used across other services which support hardware key two-factor authentication. One of the Titan Key devices will work with Bluetooth and support mobile and desktop devices, while the other plugs into a USB port. Google said it has completely cut out phishing attacks against more than 85,000 employees by requiring them to use hardware security key two-factor authentication. Hardware security keys are one of the most effective two-factor authentication methods, but users will need to avoid losing their physical devices. Google said its Titan Key is available to Google Cloud customers and will soon be listed in its online store.
