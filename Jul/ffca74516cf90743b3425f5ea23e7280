Mozilla’s creative director Tim Murray has stated that the company is evolving the Firefox brand. The moves comes as Mozilla creates “new types of browsers and a range of new apps and services with the Internet as the platform”. The brand evolution consists of two design system approaches – shown below – and Murray stated that they want feedback from users on what they do and do not like. “We are not crowdsourcing the answer. There’ll be no voting,” said Murray. “Living by our open-source values, we’re reaching out to our community to learn what people think.” He added that each icon will undergo several rounds of refinement, or may change entirely in the future. “With your input, we’ll have a final system that will make a Firefox product recognisable out in the world, even if a fox is nowhere in sight.”
