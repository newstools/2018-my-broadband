HTC’s upcoming smartphone built around blockchain technology is set to launch in Q3 2018. The company has launched a website for its Exodus smartphone, which is now accepting sign-ups for updates and more information on the device. The HTC Exodus will run on Android and will include built-in support for blockchain applications – as well as a universal cold wallet for cryptocurrencies. The device is being developed by a team led by Vive creator Phil Chen, who is overseeing cryptocurrency and blockchain initiatives at HTC. HTC said it will also launch its own blockchain network, with each Exodus smartphone acting as a node and facilitating transactions. The HTC Exodus will include support for decentralised applications and will be able to run nodes on the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains, too.
