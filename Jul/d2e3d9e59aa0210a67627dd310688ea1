EA is launching Origin Access Premier – an unlimited PC gaming subscription service – next week, reported The Verge. The report stated that the service will be on offer from 30 July 2018. It is priced at $14.99 a month, or $99.99 a year, and gives users access to the latest EA titles five days before their official release date. Users do not own the games, however, and can only play them while having an active Origin Access Premier subscription. For users who plan to play multiple EA titles each year, and are hesitant to buy games before thoroughly testing them, the new subscription service may prove to be an attractive offer.
