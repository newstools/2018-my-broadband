The Dutch Supreme Court has sent an ongoing case against The Pirate Bay back to the Court of Amsterdam, ordering it to take a fresh look at the issue, TorrentFreak reported. There have been several cases in the European Union involving website blocking, which the lower court of the Netherlands must now take into account while looking at the case. The case is an ongoing fight between anti-piracy organisation BREIN and Internet service providers in the Netherlands. BREIN originally brought the case forward in 2014, when it was ruled that ISPs do not have to block The Pirate Bay. BREIN appealed to the Supreme Court, which requested clarification from the EU Court of Justice. The EU said The Pirate Bay may be blocked, and the Dutch Supreme Court can therefore order the block. BREIN did not wait for a Supreme Court ruling, however, and approached The Hague Court of Appeal – which ruled in its favour. This interim injunction is still in effect while the case is ongoing. The blockade on The Pirate Bay may only be lifted if ISPs win the new case, the report stated.
