Cell C has launched UltraBonus, which gives users triple the airtime when they recharge. The network said new prepaid offer is available from today, 19 July 2018. “We decided to launch UltraBonus as our default prepaid tariff plan and believe this will go a long way in making the cost to stay connected more affordable,” said Cell C Chief Commercial Officer Junaid Munshi. With UltraBonus, customers will receive three-times the value every time they recharge. For example, recharging with R50 gives users R150 airtime. The bonus value is valid for calls to any local network, along with SMS and data usage. “In addition, users will receive another 100% bonus value of the recharge amount for Cell C-to-Cell C calls, as well as SMS and data,” said Cell C. “This means that by simply being a Cell C customer, you get 200% added value on top of your recharge value to make more calls, send more SMS, and enjoy even more data.” The bonus airtime is valid for 24 hours from the recharge date and time, but can be extended with additional recharges – prior to the bonus value expiring. “Bonus value that applies to data therefore does not expire for as long as customers recharge prior to expiry. The bonus airtime cannot be used to purchase bundles, pay for premium-rated services, nor can it be transferred,” said Cell C. Cell C prepaid customers who want to migrate to the UltraBonus tariff plan can do so by dialling *108# and selecting UltraBonus.
