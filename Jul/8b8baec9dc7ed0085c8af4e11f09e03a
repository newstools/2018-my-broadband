An Absa spokesperson has confirmed to MyBroadband that they will be an early-access launch partner for Samsung Pay in South Africa. This comes after the Samsung Pay app recently appeared on the Google Play store in South Africa. Samsung confirmed it plans to move from a “closed beta” to an “open beta” of the app soon. Samsung Pay is an application which lets you store bank card details on a device, and pay merchants by tapping or “swiping” your smartphone rather than a physical bank card. “Early access will be open to all Absa customers in South Africa and will be available on the Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+, Note 8, S8, S8+, S7, S7 Edge, A8, and coming soon on the A5/A7,” said Absa. Selected customers will also be invited to join the early-access programme over the coming days. “Customers are reminded that Absa will never contact them directly via SMS or email to register for Samsung Pay using hyperlinks or attachments provided in the SMS or email,” said Absa. Samsung added that it aims to launch Samsung Pay locally by the end of August 2018.
