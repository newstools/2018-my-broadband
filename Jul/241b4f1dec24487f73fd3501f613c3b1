Slack is purchasing the IP for competing workplace chat applications HipChat and Stride. Both applications were developed by Atlassian, and the company is working with Slack to migrate its users onto the platform. The news was announced by Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield, who stated that Slack is purchasing the IP for its competitors to allow for smoother migration. Butterfield said Atlassian would make a small but symbolically investment in Slack, encouraging the teams of both companies to collaborate on user migration. Slack said HipChat and Stride users would have seven months to migrate to Slack, with platforms shutting down on 15 February 2019. There is no information on how the deal will affect other Atlassian products. The deal we’re announcing today with Atlassian is pretty amazing. Indeed, I tried to fit it all in one (280 character) tweet but I just couldn’t do it. So, I’ll lay it out in a few. But first, I wanted to thank Scott, Mike, Jay and the team: incredible to work with you. — Stewart Butterfield (@stewart) July 26, 2018
