Snapchat is working on a search feature which allows users to identify products with their smartphone camera, TechCrunch reported. The visual product search would then redirect users to Amazon product listings after an object or barcode is scanned. Details on the functionality is hidden in Snapchat’s app code and was discovered by app researcher Ishan Agarwal. The search feature is reportedly codenamed “Project Eagle” and could potentially open up new revenue streams for Snapchat. Snapchat has reportedly named the feature “Camera Search” in the latest version of its app, and the hidden code points to the ability for users to copy the URL of a product listing and share it with others via messages or Snapchat Stories. There is currently no information available regarding the rollout of Snapchat’s Camera Search function.
