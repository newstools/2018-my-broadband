Huawei is set to roll out an update for Honor and Huawei smartphones which will increase GPU efficiency by 60%, Digital Trends reported. The upcoming patch will also reportedly cut down graphics battery consumption by 30%, and will be delivered over the air to users at no cost. The update – named GPU Turbo – will allow mid-range devices to run demanding mobile games smoothly at higher frame rates. Huawei reportedly believes that several of its Honor devices will be able to outperform other smartphones with strong graphics units. The new software will also support virtual and augmented reality apps in the future. GPU Turbo will reportedly roll out to the Huawei P20, P20 Pro, Mate RS, Mate 10, and Mate 10 Pro in August 2018, and the P20 Lite, Mate 9, Mate 9 Pro, P10, and P10 Plus in September 2018. A number of Honor devices will also receive the update later this year.
