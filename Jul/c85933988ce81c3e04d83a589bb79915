Opera has announced that its Android web browser will get a built-in cryptocurrency wallet with support for Ethereum’s Web3 API. This means users will be able to browse the Internet as normal while interacting with blockchain-based applications such as CryptoKitties. Users will also be able to make and receive payments using their browser’s cryptocurrency wallet. Unlike other dApp browsers and interfaces, Opera allows users to explore decentralised applications through a familiar browser interface – without the need for extensions such as MetaMask. Opera said its browser uses the user’s system unlock screen code as a private key, meaning there is also no need for learning new passwords. The browser’s built-in Ethereum wallet will also support ERC20 and ERC721 tokens. “Having a crypto wallet in the browser brings the cash experience to the world of online payments,” said Opera crypto product lead Charles Hamel. “Paying with the crypto wallet is like sending digital cash straight from your phone, and we’ve just made it easier.” Opera added that it is the first major browser to interface directly with the decentralised web. “By becoming the first major browser to open up to Web 3.0, we would like to contribute to making the Internet of the future more accessible,” said Hamel. Android users can sign up for the beta preview of the Opera cryptocurrency wallet on the Google Play Store.
