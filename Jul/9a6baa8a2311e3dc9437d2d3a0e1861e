Samsung is likely to drop the fingerprint sensor in its new Galaxy Tab S4 tablet, according to a report by Softpedia. The report stated that the device will use iris scanning and facial recognition for biometric authentication, following an analysis of the tablet’s firmware. It added that this may be the first step in Samsung moving away from fingerprint sensors in smart devices – moving to only facial and iris scanning systems. The play comes after Apple took the bold step of employing facial recognition as the primary authentication method in its iPhone X – following years of its smartphones featuring fingerprint sensors. Other smartphone makers have also ditched the fingerprint sensor of late, including Oppo in its Find X device. The move away from fingerprint sensors, particularly on the front of a device, allows companies to produce improved screen-to-body ratios.
