Technomobi is offering the newly-launched Nokia 8110 4G for pre-order together with other massive discounts on high-end smartphones. HMD Global recently introduced the Nokia 8110 to the market – which is a re-release of the iconic Nokia phone made famous in The Matrix. While it sports the iconic design of the original feature phone, the device’s software and components are completely reworked. The new Nokia 8110 4G looks much like the original, with its curved protective cover that slides open and closed to pick up and end calls, but runs on Nokia’s Smart Feature Operating System powered by KaiOS. Another highlight of the phone is that it offers fast 4G LTE capabilities for improved surf, chat, and streaming functionality, while offering powerful multi-day battery life – just like the original. Its Qualcomm 205 mobile platform is optimised to bring performance without compromising on battery life, and brings up to 25 days of standby time from a single charge. Pre-orders for the device start at R1,199 and will come with a free data starter pack, which includes 100MB per month for 12 months. Shipping starts from 24 July 2018.
