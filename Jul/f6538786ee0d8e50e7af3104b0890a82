Apple has launched new versions of its MacBook Pro laptops, with improved hardware specifications and features. The new MacBook Pro models now feature 6-core CPUs, 32GB of RAM, and the Apple T2 Chip for improved security. “Apple today updated MacBook Pro with faster performance and new pro features, making it the most advanced Mac notebook ever,” said Apple. The new devices feature 8th-generation Intel Core processors, which offer superior performance compared to the processors in previous MacBook Pro models. A Retina True Tone display – with 500 nits of brightness and support for the P3 wide colour gamut – and an improved third-generation keyboard for quieter typing have also been included in the MacBook Pro – following issues with the keyboard in the current generation of laptops. Radeon Pro graphics, large Force Touch trackpads, the Touch Bar and Touch ID, stereo speakers, and Thunderbolt 3 ports are carried over into the new MacBook Pro line-up, added Apple. Users who demand high levels of storage will also be happy to hear that the laptops can be fitted with up to 4TB of SSD storage in the 15-inch model. The table below details the hardware available in the new MacBook Pro 13-inch and 15-inch models. The new laptops start at $1,799 and $2,399 for the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, respectively. A top-of-the-line MacBook Pro 15-inch – with Intel Core i9 CPU, 32GB of RAM, Radeon Pro 560X, and 4TB of SSD storage – retails for $6,699 on Apple’s US store.
