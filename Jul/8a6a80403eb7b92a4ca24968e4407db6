The Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASA) has ruled that a OneDayOnly daily deals discount was misleading. On 6 June 2018, OneDayOnly advertised a JBL Playlist Wireless speaker with built-in Chromecast for R2,199 – which it said offers a 37% discount over the retail price of R3,500. One consumer lodged a complaint with the ASA, arguing that the retail price and the discount were inflated. He said the most expensive listing for the same product could be found at Dion Wired for R3,000, and that he could not find the price of R3,500 for the advertised product anywhere. “Similar price comparisons found the price of the speaker to be around R2,400 to R2,800 easily. The 37% discount is therefore misleading to the consumer,” he said. OneDayOnly responded to the complaint, explaining that its buying team conducts comparative research before listing a retail price. “Whilst it does often exclude the short-term marketing specials of other online discount stores, it often includes the official product importer or distributor, and where possible a survey of traditional retail stores,” it said. The ASA said the responsibility is on the advertiser to prove that its pre-sale price is reasonable and relevant in the market place. It added that it was only able to find the product for sale from around R2,200, with the most expensive example it could find being R2,999 at Dion Wired. It subsequently ruled that OneDayOnly’s advertising was misleading.
