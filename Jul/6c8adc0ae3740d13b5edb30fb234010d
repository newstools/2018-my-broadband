Telkom has launched a 1GB WhatsApp bundle for R15, where the data lasts for 30 days and can only be used on the messaging platform. The new WhatsApp data bundle is available through the *123# USSD menu by selecting option 2. While Telkom’s WhatsApp product will be attractive to certain Telkom subscribers, it is not the best deal available in South Africa. Telkom’s 1GB WhatsApp data bundle is more expensive than the same product from MTN, which costs R10. It does, however, offer better value for money than Cell C’s 30-day WhatsApp bundle, which also costs R15, but only allows for 600MB data use. The table below provides an overview of the 1GB WhatsApp bundles available to subscribers.
