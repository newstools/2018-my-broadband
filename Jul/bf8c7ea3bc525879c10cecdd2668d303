The OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 5T are set to receive faster software updates following a beta OS update which adds support for Google’s Project Treble. Project Treble is a Google initiative which allows developers to deploy new software updates more quickly to supported devices. The Oxygen OS Open Beta updates for both devices are rolling out to adopters and include Project Treble support, an overhauled interface, and an upgraded app drawer. OnePlus said it has finally found a solution to implementing support for Project Treble, after originally stating that the devices would not support the feature. “After several months of evaluation and hard work, we finally found a solution to make this possible, and we are very excited to share this good news with you,” said OnePlus. The open beta software is available from the company’s download page.
