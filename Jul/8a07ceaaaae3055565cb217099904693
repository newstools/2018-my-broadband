While fixed-LTE services can be used as a primary connection for your home, many users have an LTE package as a backup in case their fibre or DSL goes down. Fixed-LTE is a great interim measure if your high-speed primary connection goes down, as many LTE networks offer download speeds of 50Mbps and up. If you acquire a fixed-LTE product as a backup for your primary connection, however, you will not need spades of data. The plan is to use the LTE for a day or two while whatever issues with your fibre or DSL is resolved, and then switch back to the fixed line. While you may cut back on the massive downloads during this time, your browsing, email, video streaming, and VoIP usage must still be taken care of as normal. Cue a small-cap fixed LTE package, which can satisfy these needs. A cap of around 20GB, for example, should do the job if you average one outage a month – which is hopefully well above what you will typically experience.
