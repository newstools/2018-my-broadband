Samsung is rolling out its payment app in South Africa, now offering an early-access programme. Users can sign up for the early-access version of Samsung Pay by downloading the app on a compatible device and registering on the Samsung website. Currently, only Absa customers are eligible. Standard Bank will join the early access programme in the near future. Samsung Pay lets customers pay using their smartphones instead of their bank card by mimicking Magnetic Secure Transmission and contactless cards. This allows users to make payments by tapping their smartphone against a card machine. The following devices are supported by the Samsung Pay early-access programme: Samsung Pay will also be supported on the Galaxy A5 and A7 (2017 and newer) in August 2018. Samsung stated that users who pay 10 times with Samsung Pay during the early-access period stand a chance to win one of five Galaxy S9 phones. “Once you’ve used Samsung Pay, you’ll wonder how you lived without it,” said Samsung South Africa VP of Integrated Mobility Craige Fleischer.
