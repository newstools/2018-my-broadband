The EFF has stated it will destroy Vodacom stores unless the company pays Please Call Me “inventor” Nkosana Makate for his idea. The EFF’s Fanie Sibeko said: “What we did to H&M, we can also do it here at Vodacom.” This was in reference to the EFF trashing H&M stores in South Africa earlier this year. Makate and Vodacom have been in negotiations since 2016 over the matter, after the Constitutional Court ordered that Vodacom compensate Makate for its use of the Please Call Me. The figure Makate was pursuing was reported to be as high as R10 billion – based on a compensation amount of 15c for ever rand of revenue the service generated. The dispute between Makate and Vodacom has made headlines several times over the past two years, but Makate and Vodacom recently reached an agreement where neither party would disclose any information about their settlement negotiations. The EFF has now stated Vodacom must “give what is due” to Makate, according to a report by Jacaranda FM. The statement was made after a group of supporters gathered at Vodacom’s headquarters in Midrand on Wednesday. According to the EFF, Makate must be paid 15% of the revenue Vodacom made from the service. “You must give what is due to him. It is a problem with an African child when you need to pay them,” said Sibeko, according to Jacaranda FM. Vodacom did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
