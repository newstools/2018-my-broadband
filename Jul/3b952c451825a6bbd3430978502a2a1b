Samsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S10 in three variants, instead of the usual “standard” and “plus” configurations, Forbes reported. This is because Samsung will have an “entry-level” Galaxy S10 option, which will exclude an in-display fingerprint reader – expected in the other two models. The cheaper Galaxy S10 will have the fingerprint reader mounted on the side of the device’s frame, according to the report. Each in-display fingerprint module will cost $15, which is more than seven-times the price of the normal fingerprint sensor Samsung has used in its previous phones, BGR reported. It also reported that Qualcomm will supply the optical fingerprint sensors to Samsung, and that the Galaxy S10+ will have a triple-lens camera system.
