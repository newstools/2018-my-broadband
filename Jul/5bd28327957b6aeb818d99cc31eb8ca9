Liquid Telecom has signed an agreement with Telecom Egypt which will enable it to complete construction of a terrestrial fibre network from Cape Town to Cairo. Liquid Telecom will link its network from Sudan to Telecom Egypt’s network, resulting in a single network between the two cities. “Completing our vision of building a single network running on land, all the way from Cape to Cairo is a historic moment for the company and for a more connected Africa,” said Econet executive chairman Strive Masiyiwa. “We expect to see a lot of traffic between Egypt and the rest of Africa.” The memorandum of understanding signed by both companies will result in Liquid Telecom having unrivalled access through Telecom Egypt’s interconnection services and Telecom Egypt gaining access to Liquid Telecom’s pan-African network. “We look forward to working alongside Liquid Telecom to develop new network services and products that will help stimulate intra-regional trade,” said Telecom Egypt CEO Ahmed El Beheiry.
