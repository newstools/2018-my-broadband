Facebook has revealed to the US Congress that it had data sharing deals in place with 52 hardware and software vendors. Partners includedÂ Apple, BlackBerry, Amazon, Microsoft, and Huawei. It outlined the deals in 747 pages of documents submitted to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in response to questions from Congress. News of the partnerships comes after Facebook disputed reports by The New York Times and Wall Street Journal about the deals. Facebook said the partnerships were intended to help device makers create their own versions of Facebook apps, and that the data it shared mostly remained on phones that accessed it. This kind of arrangement was necessary before phone operating systems relied on app stores, said Facebook. Facebook has ended 38 of the 52 partnerships, and another seven will be shut down by the end of July, it said. Among the few that will continue are those with Amazon, Apple, and Alibaba.
