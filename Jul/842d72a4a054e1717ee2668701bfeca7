Nissan recently launched the new Micra in South Africa, which is now available from R233,500. The modern hatchback is available in three models, detailed below, and caters to a variety of car buyers. “The fifth generation of Nissan’s iconic Micra represents a significant progression in design and will revitalise the small car segment in South Africa,” said Nissan. The new Nissan Micra is also equipped with a wide range of technologies designed to enhance the car’s comfort, convenience, and safety performance. “The 7-inch touchscreen colour display on the Acenta and Acenta Plus allows the driver to access features such as music, messages, and maps through Apple CarPlay – in addition to the MP3, USB and, Bluetooth in the Visia model,” said Nissan. Nissan has also made improvements under the hood, with a 66kW, 140Nm turbo-charged petrol engine powering the car. “The Micra also benefits from a remarkably quiet cabin, promoting a comfortable and more relaxing experience for the driver. It’s due to the enhanced noise isolation technology engineered into the car and is particularly noticeable during high-speed driving.” As with all Nissan vehicles, quality and reliability come standard. This includes coverage by Nissan Assured, and a 6-year/150,000km warranty. A 3-year/90,000km service plan and 24/7 roadside assistance are also included.
