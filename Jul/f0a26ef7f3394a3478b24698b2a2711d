NASA’s eclipse website states that a total lunar eclipse is happening on 27 July 2018, and will last for 1 hour and 43 minutes. CBS News reported this will be the longest lunar eclipse of the century, and it will be viewable from multiple continents – including most of Africa. The eclipse will also be partially visible for 3 hours and 55 minutes. Lunar eclipses happen when the sun, Earth, and moon line up so the Earth’s shadow is cast on the moon. It always happens within two weeks of a solar eclipse. Two partial solar eclipses will also take place on 12 July and 11 August 2018. Earlier this year, there was a Super Blue Blood Moon, a total eclipse which happened with a super moon. The moon appeared very large and bright on the second full moon in January. Before this, South Africa got to see a Super Blood Moon on 28 September 2015 – where the moon was eclipsed at its nearest point to the Earth.
