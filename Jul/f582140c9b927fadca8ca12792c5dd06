Telkom recently launched its Big Deal for July 2018, two uncapped fixed-LTE packages aimed at home users. The deals are offered in “All Hours” and “Business Hours” varieties, and both come with a Huawei B525 router. Telkom stated that the B525 can handle four LAN-connected devices, and 64 wireless devices, at a time – and described it as “Huawei’s newest offering”. While there are international reports about the B525 router from 2017, not much information on the device is available locally. Following questions from MyBroadband, Huawei confirmed that it has brought the router in for Telkom – which is being bundled with the latest Big Deal packages. A Huawei spokesperson added that there are plans to bring the B525 device to more operators and platforms in South Africa. The Huawei B525 joins an established list of Huawei LTE/4G routers in the country. Of late, the Huawei B618 has grown in popularity, thanks to ISPs selling the device with their Rain fixed-LTE packages. LTE users will also be familiar with the Huawei B315 router, sold by Telkom with certain LTE packages. The specifications of the B525 are listed below.
