Western Digital will shut down its hard drive manufacturing factory in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia by the end of 2019, Tomâ€™s Hardware reports. The decision was reportedly made due to the growing dominance of the SSD and NAND flash market, and the encroachment of the newer technologies on the market for traditional HDDs. The Western Digital factory in Malaysia opened 1973 and transitioned from manufacturing semiconductors to building mechanical hard drives. The company still owns two major hard drive factories in Thailand, and various substrate manufacturing facilities in Malaysia. Western Digital is also expanding its SSD manufacturing capabilities and is reportedly set to open a second SSD facility in Malaysia.
