Microsoft is working on its Windows 10 updates with the aim of fixing the “sudden reboot”. According to Softpedia, Microsoft said it wants to avoid creating user frustration from the operating system restarting to install updates an inconvenient times. “In the most recent Windows 10 preview builds shipped for Redstone 5 and Redstone 6, the OS comes with a new so-called predictive model based on machine learning that would help determine whether a system is in use or not,” stated the report. If a PC is not in use, the model can determine if a user is taking a short break or is finished using the computer. “We heard you, and to alleviate this pain, if you have an update pending we’ve updated our reboot logic to use a new system that is more adaptive and proactive,” said Dona Sarkar, who heads up Windows Insider. The report stated that the feature has been tested internally and shown good results.
