WhatsApp has started rolling out group calling on the platform, after Facebook first announced the feature at its F8 2018 conference in May 2018. Mubarik Imam, a director at WhatsApp, said they have over 450 million unique users per day, who make over 2 billion minutes of calls daily. The group calling feature is currently rolling out on the iPhone and Android versions of WhatsApp. To use it, you must first start a call with someone, then click the “add participants” button shown in the top right corner of the chat window. Currently, up to four people may participate in a group call. Facebook said that group calls are encrypted end-to-end, and are designed to work on low-bandwidth networks.
