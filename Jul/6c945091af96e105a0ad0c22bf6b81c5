Twitter has denied limiting the visibility of prominent Republicans in search results, or “shadow banning” the accounts. This follows a report by VICE which found that the Twitter accounts of several conservatives were not appearing in the auto-completing drop-down in the platform’s search function. According to the report, Twitter directed VICE to a blog post the company published in May which outlined several steps it was taking to crack down on troll-like behaviour on Twitter. However, Twitter has since issued a statement categorically denying that it shadow bans people on its platform. It said the many accounts were not showing up in auto-completed search results was due to a wide-ranging issue on the platform. “Hundreds of thousands of accounts were impacted by this issue. This impact was not limited to a certain political affiliation or geography. And, to be clear, these accounts were only impacted within search auto-suggestions – they still appeared in search results. This issue has now been resolved,” said Twitter. Twitter added that certain Democrats were also not showing up within search auto-suggestions as result of this issue. “Most accounts affected had nothing to do with politics at all,” said Twitter.
