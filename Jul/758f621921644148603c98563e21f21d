Rain Mobile customers will start paying for per-GB data usage for the first time from tomorrow, following the network’s launch on 6 June 2018. Rain offered a variety of packages at launch – including SIM-only, MiFi router bundles, and dual-SIM smartphone packages – all of which included an allocation of “unlimited data days”. Data usage would not be charged for during the period, which ranged from 15 days to 90 days – depending on which package you purchased. Due to problems with Rain delivering SIMs and devices after opening orders, however, Rain users were given free data for June 2018. This meant that the “unlimited data days” allocations only kicked in from 1 July 2018. With the smallest “unlimited data days” allocation 15 days, Rain Mobile customers who bought a SIM-only package will start paying for per-GB data usage from tomorrow, 16 July. Rain has sent a “heads-up” email to clients reminding them that the free data days are coming to an end. “Once your data days are done, you can continue on Rain’s one plan at 5c per meg, R50 a gig. Simply log onto your dashboard now to set a spend limit that will kick in when your data days are up,” said Rain. When tested by MyBroadband, via Rain’s online dashboard, the default spend limit was found to be R1,500 per month for a SIM. The limit can then be adjusted in increments of R50, down to R50 per month. Users are also able to turn their spend limit off. Rain users who wish to continue receiving unlimited data can purchase an “unlimited off-peak” add-on for their SIM at R250 per month. This add-on gives users unlimited data usage for 19 hours per day during off-peak times – 23:00 to 18:00. Users must increase their spend limit to R300 to be able to activate the add-on, as it is charged to their account on a monthly basis.
