The Wall Street Journal hasÂ reported that the antitrust watchdog of the EU is expected to find that Google abused its dominance in the smartphone operating system space with Android. Should the EU rule against Google, it will issue a multibillion-euro fine and order that it change its Android business practices, stated the report. Android represents around 85% of the overall smartphone market, according to the IDC, largely because manufacturers who use the operating system can offer devices across a wide spectrum of price points. Reports suggest that for vendors to gain access to important Android services such as the Google Play marketplace, they are required to bundle other Google apps with their devices. According to the Washington Post, Google may be forced to stop app bundling deals with manufacturers that use Android. Among the problematic apps is Google Chrome, which the report stated allows Google to collect and monetise user data.
