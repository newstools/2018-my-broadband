Netflix has overhauled its profile system, launching a range of new profile options. Five years after it launched profiles, Netflix now allows for more icon options and is improving its recommendation system. Users can select a number of new profile icons, including characters from Netflix shows and movies like Stranger Things. “Profiles are key to creating a highly personalised Netflix experience,” said Netflix. “By watching on your own profile, we can showcase suggestions for TV shows and movies we’re sure you won’t want to miss.” Netflix’s new profile icons will roll out across its web, mobile, and TV platforms in the coming weeks.
