Comcast has withdrawn its $65-billion bid to acquire 21st Century Fox, stating it would not pursue the acquisition. This leaves 21st Century Fox free to be acquired by Disney, which recently upped its offer for the entertainment asset to $71 billion. Comcast issued an official statement regarding the bidding war, stating it would focus instead on its intended acquisition of Sky. “Comcast does not intend to pursue further the acquisition of the Twenty-First Century Fox assets and, instead, will focus on our recommended offer for Sky,” said the company. Comcast CEO Brian Roberts congratulated Disney on the acquisition after bowing out of the bidding war. “I’d like to congratulate Bob Iger and the team at Disney, and commend the Murdoch family and Fox for creating such a desirable and respected company,” he said.
