FibreCo has rolled out fibre infrastructure in Kroonstad, making high-speed broadband connectivity more accessible. Kroonstad is the third-largest city in the Free State and is the first city along the FibreCo national fibre route between Johannesburg and Cape Town to have fibre rolled out to it. FibreCo said it plans to connect many more towns along its 4,000km national fibre route in the future. “FibreCo’s open access model in Kroonstad allows any number of service providers and operators to buy connectivity without the large capital outlay, making it significantly more affordable than if they were to build the infrastructure themselves,” said FibreCo CEO Simon Harvey. The first ISP to partner with FibreCo in Kroonstad is Access Global Communication. “It is a great honour to be the first ISP associated with FibreCo in Kroonstad,” said Access Global Communication executive director Hennie Roets. FibreCo said it has also provided high-speed broadband connectivity services to clinics in Kroonstad. The company has also installed a fibre node at the Moqhaka Municipality, making it the first Free State municipality with its own dedicated 1Gbps connectivity node.
