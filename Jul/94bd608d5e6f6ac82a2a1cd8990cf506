On Monday, 16 July 2018, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos became the richest person in modern history. Bezos founded Amazon, and at 54 years old set the wealth record when his net worth broke the $150-billion mark. Michael Cole, CEO of Cresset Family Office, said the number was “hard to even put it in perspective”. “It’s such a staggering number,” he said. And he’s right – it is difficult to comprehend how much money this actually is when you think about a single person having access to it. First off, you would probably want it converted to rand as a South African. At the time of writing, $150 billion equalled R1,987,920,000,000. That’s R1.9 trillion. This does even less to put the number in perspective – however, breaking it down into smaller chunks can help. If you were Bezos and could turn all your assets into cash, and convert them to rand, you would have enormous spending power. You could spend R5,446,356,164 (that’s R5.4 billion) every day for a year, or you could buy 466,757 Porsche 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series cars. Alternatively, if you converted the fortune into R100 notes and laid them out side-by-side, the money trail would measure 2,902,363km. Arguably the most interesting comparison to make is how long it would take an elite South African CEO to earn Bezos’s wealth. Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub is a perfect example – running a large, successful company and earning a healthy salary as a reward. Joosub took home R50 million for the year ended 31 March 2018 – a number which most South Africans would settle for in an instant. Compared to what Bezos is worth, however, this is a drop in the ocean. At R50 million per year, Joosub would have to work for 39,758 years to match the Amazon’s founder’s fortune – and this is excluding income tax.
