NASA will conduct supersonic flight tests over Galveston, Texas in November 2018, using an F/A-18 Hornet to gain an understanding of acceptable noise levels, Live Science reported. Earlier this year, NASA awarded a $247.5-million contract to Lockheed Martin to build a quiet supersonic plane called the X-59 QueSST. According to NASA, instead of hearing two loud booms as the X-59 breaks the sound barrier, you’ll hear two softer “thumps”. However, the new plane is only expected to launch by the end of 2021, and flights over communities are only expected to happen from 2023. In the interim, NASA is conducting flight tests with the F/A-18 Hornet to gather data. NASA said that if new regulations are written regarding supersonic flight over land, it could open a new market for commercial air travel. Examples of the tests in action can be seen in the video below. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
