Google Assistant is slowly getting updated with additional integration with other Google applications, including Google Duo. According to a report by Android Police, Google Assistant now supports placing video calls through the company’s Duo video chat platform. Duo is a video chat mobile app developed by Google which supports video and voice calling. The new integration is currently rolling out, with certain users able to invoke Duo video calls by telling their assistant to “video call” any contact they have saved on their device. This feature is reportedly rolling out at different rates to users around the world, and there is no official announcement regarding the integration of Duo with Google Assistant.
