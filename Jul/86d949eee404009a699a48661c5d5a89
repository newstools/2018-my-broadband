TorrentFreak has released its list of the most downloaded movies through BitTorrent over the past week. TorrentFreak uses its estimates of the number of times a movie was downloaded for its weekly chart. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom took the top spot this week, pushing Escape Plan 2: Hades down to second while Sanju rapidly climbed the charts to third place. “The data for our weekly download chart is for informational and educational reference only,” said TorrentFreak. New movies shared via torrent sites, and included in the list below, are typically “illegal” copies, as they infringe on the copyright of their respective content owners.
