Podcast app Castbox has introduced a blockchain-based infrastructure named Contentbox, which it hopes will help publishers and podcasters earn money. In an interview with TechCrunch, the company said it would offer podcasters a micropayment plan built on blockchain technology to help them earn more from their content. “The existing model is broken,” said Castbox CEO Renee Wang. “Creators are not getting what they deserve and consumers are not getting a reward for engaging with content.” While there are not many details available regarding the Contentbox platform, it will reportedly allow listeners to become “investors” and for content creators to benefit more from their audience. “Castbox eliminates user friction and makes paid subscriptions easily accessible so publishers can generate more revenue and grow their following,” said Wang.
