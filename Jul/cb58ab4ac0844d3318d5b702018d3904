Elon Musk, Google, and a number of other individuals and companies have pledged not to build automated AI weapons, Engadget reported. Over 160 companies and 2,400 individuals signed a pledge laid out by the Future of Life Institute, the organisation announced. The pledge requires that companies and high-profile individuals “neither participate in nor support the development, manufacture, trade, or use of lethal autonomous weapons”. Additionally, all who sign the pledge agreed that the decision to take a human life should never be made by a machine. “Thousands of AI researchers agree that by removing the risk, attributability, and difficulty of taking human lives, lethal autonomous weapons could become powerful instruments of violence and oppression, especially when linked to surveillance and data systems,” stated the pledge. Future of Life Institute President Max Tegmark stated his disdain for lethal AI weapons. “AI weapons that autonomously decide to kill people are as disgusting and destabilising as bioweapons, and should be dealt with in the same way,” said Tegmark.
