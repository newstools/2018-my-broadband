Commenting on unaudited month-end fuel price data, the AA has stated that petrol prices will remain virtually unchanged in August 2018. The stable prices can be attributed to better exchange rate performance and decreases in international oil prices, it said. “During July, the recent weakening trend of the rand against the US dollar slowed.” Additionally, the international decrease in oil prices offset the rand’s losses against the US dollar. “As a result, petrol is expected to increase by around two cents a litre, and illuminating paraffin by four cents a litre.” Diesel will decrease in price by approximately four cents per litre. The AA added that motorists should remain cautious of fuel price increases and budget pressure for the rest of 2018.
