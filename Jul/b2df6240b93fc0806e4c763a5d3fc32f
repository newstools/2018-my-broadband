The Stockholm Patent and Market Court has found three men connected to Advanced TV Network (ATN), a “pirate” IPTV service, guilty of copyright infringement and misuse of decoding information, TorrentFreak reported. It ordered them to pay damages of 209 million Swedish kroner (R319 million), and sentenced them to prison. According to the report, ATV had over 70,000 subscribers at its peak and generated millions in profits. It has since gone bankrupt. BeIN Sports from Qatar and the Albanian TV group Digitalb filed the case against ATN, accusing it of rebroadcasting their channels without permission. ATN was an incorporated company in Sweden which paid taxes and filed annual reports. These showed that the company made 60 million Swedish kroner (R92 million) in 2013, with a healthy profit margin. The owner of ATN was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, while his son and another accomplice each received prison sentences of one year.
