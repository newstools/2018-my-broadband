Googleâ€™s Duo video calling app now supports the same sign-in across multiple Android devices, 9to5Google reported. The feature is reportedly included in the latest version of the application, which is rolling out to users. Google Duo previously limited users to only being signed in on a single device at a time. If your app has received the latest update, you will be able to sign into Google Duo on two devices, with both ringing when you receive a call. Users will also be able to selectively sign out of their Duo account on individual devices.
