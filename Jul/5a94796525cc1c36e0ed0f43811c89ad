Tesla announced on Twitter that its Summon feature is now available for its Model 3 sedan. This feature expands the Tesla Model 3’s autonomous driving abilities, allowing the vehicle to park itself. Using Summon, owners can watch their Model 3 remotely drive into an open parking spot and power down, even controlling smart garage doors. Summon can also be used to bring the Tesla Model 3 to the driver from its parking spot without anyone at the wheel of the vehicle. Tesla has ramped up its production of the Model 3 vehicle, recently reaching its production goals of 5,000 Model 3 electric cars per week. The company also continues to manufacture Model S and Model X vehicles, at a total rate of 2,000 per week.
