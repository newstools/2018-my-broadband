Microsoft has rolled out the latest version of its Skype messenger, Skype 8.0, to desktop. The company said the new version will replace Skype 7.0, with older versions of the application no longer supported from September 2018. “We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience, as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018,” said Microsoft. “This is done to ensure that all customers have the best possible Skype experience, and that there are no quality or reliability issues resulting from old technology and new technology interoperating.” Skype 8.0 includes a number of new features, including free HD video and screen-sharing calls, chat mentions and media galleries, and the ability to share up to 300MB of files at a time within conversations. Microsoft will also bring end-to-end encrypted audio calls and messages to Skype 8.0 later this year.
