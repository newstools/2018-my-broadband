Cable.co.uk has published the latest Worldwide Broadband Speed League report using data from Measurement Lab (M-Lab), the largest global provider of open Internet performance data. M-Lab is a partnership between New America’s Open Technology Institute, Google Open Source Research, Princeton University’s PlanetLab, and various supporting partners. Data was measured over the period of June 2017 to May 2018 and compared to the same period the previous year to determine the year-over-year change in broadband speeds. Over 200 countries were included, with key measurements including average download speeds and unique IP addresses. South Africa ranks in the top 100 countries for broadband speed in the world, but still falls well below the global average download speed of 9.10Mbps. Kenya, Israel, and Vietnam are among the countries which outpace South Africa in average download speeds. South Africa saw a 2% increase in average download speed compared to last year, however, moving the country up two places in the rankings. The country rankings for 60-80th place are shown below. The unique IP column indicates unique IP addresses which conducted monitored speed tests. Singapore and Sweden retained their positions at the top of the leaderboard in average download speeds, with other European countries moving up the rankings. Luxembourg saw an average download speed increase of 19.62% and rocketed up 25 places to number 8. The United States comes in at number 20, well below a number of European and Asian nations – including Estonia, Japan, and Hong Kong. The top 10 countries, ranked by average download speed, are listed below.
