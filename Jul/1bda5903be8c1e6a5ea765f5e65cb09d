Google is rolling out a dark theme for YouTube on Android, 9to5Google reported. The feature was announced in March last year, and first rolled out to the iOS version of YouTube’s mobile app. According to the report, the YouTube app for Android will automatically switch to the dark theme when the feature rolls out to users. A notification will appear at the bottom of the screen to tell users about the change. A toggle for the dark theme will also be added to the YouTube app’s general settings, should you wish to disable it. When the dark theme is enabled, the background of the YouTube app, its settings pages, and search all switch to a dark grey background. The video player itself also adopts a dark theme. The report said that one notable exception are channel pages, which retain their colourful app bars.
