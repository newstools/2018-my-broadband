Hisense has announced the launch date for its next-generation ULED TVs in South Africa. The manufacturer said it has improved its U9A and U8A-series panels with Quantum Dot technology, which has resulted in enhanced colour and contrast, in addition to improved HDR. Hisense has also added Prime Array Backlighting to its flagship 75U9A TV, which divides the backlight into 1,056 discrete zones and greatly improves contrast ratio. The new ULED panels boast improved HDR technology and increased picture quality specifications, including maximum brightness, colour gamut, and contrast, said Hisense. It added that it has also overhauled the sound design of its ULED lineup. “On the entire Hisense 2018 Premium ULED and ULED range, the TVs have moved away from the traditional downward-facing speaker and towards front and rear-facing speakers,” said Hisense. The company said its new ULED TV lineup would be available in South Africa from July 2018.
