YouTube is investing $25 million in improving the breaking news experience on the video platform. The investment is a YouTube-specific plan which forms part of the Google News Initiative (GNI), aimed at promoting quality journalism and combatting fake news. YouTube will establish a working group with reputable news organisations to improve its news experience, including Vox Media and India Today. The video platform will also provide funding to news organisations around the world, helping them to build sustainable video operations. YouTube said it would expand its support team for news publishers, and provide additional sources and context on breaking news. The platform is rolling out Top News and Breaking News pages, too, which highlight videos from global publishers about news events.
