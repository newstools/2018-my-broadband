Benchmarks for what appear to be Intel’s ninth-generation Core i7 processors have been found in the SiSoft Sandra database, Ars Technica reported. The CPU is listed as a Core i7-9700K with eight cores. While this represents an increase from the six cores in eight-generation processors, the benchmarks suggest the new i7 will not feature hyperthreading. With hyperthreading, the operating system addresses two virtual cores for each processor core that is physically present – sharing the workload between them when possible. Ars Technica noted that before Intel’s eighth-generation chips, its Core CPUs followed a predictable pattern. Core i3 processors had fewer cores than the Core i5, but had hyperthreading enabled. Core i7 chips had the same number of cores as the i5, but with hyperthreading enabled. Intel dropped hyperthreading from the Core i3 line recently, however, and it seems it will do the same with the next Core i7. Intel may then differentiate its CPUs by having eight physical cores in the Core i7, six cores in the Core i5, and four cores in the Core i3. None will have hyperthreading. The Core i9 will then have the same number of physical cores as the Core i7, but with hyperthreading enabled.
