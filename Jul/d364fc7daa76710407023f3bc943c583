Fujifilm has released its new Instax SHARE SP-3 pocket printer, bringing the square film format together with the ease and fun of mobile printing. What sets the sleek device apart from bulky instant cameras is that the SP-3 doesn’t take its own photos. Rather, it receives photos via Wi-Fi from the Instax Share app. As a result, the device is small enough to carry around, and there is no time-consuming import process – as the app has access to your smartphone’s camera roll. Users can also print photos straight from their social media accounts.  The Instax Share SP-3 is incredibly easy to use. It includes a power button on one side and a reprint button on the other side. The SP-3 is powered by a 1,000mAh rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which can be charged inside the device or easily removed and replaced. Coloured LEDs on the top of the device indicate how much power is left as well as how many prints are still left in each film pack. One of 10 white lights goes out every time a picture is printed, which is very useful, as the device can’t be opened without ruining the unused film. Empty film cartridges can be replaced by pressing a button on the side to open an access panel. The empty cartridge is then easily removed and replaced with a new one. New cartridges also have a protective light-proof sheet that is automatically ejected like a print when the door is closed. The specifications of the Instax Share SP-3 are detailed below.  Connecting the device to the Instax Share app is quick and easy – the device simply needs to be turned on when using the app to search for a nearby printer. Users can add a password to prevent others from connecting to their SP-3 device, too. The app then accesses your phone’s gallery, including images received via WhatsApp or downloaded. Users can also connect to social media services or photo services, such as Instagram, Facebook, and Google photos. Once an image has been selected, the app also offers editing options that include basic filters and templates. Once an image has been selected, cropped, and repositioned, printing it is as simple as selecting the print button in the app. The SP-3 prints images quickly, while the development of the images takes about five minutes to complete. Once developed, you will have a square print with retro charm. The Instax Share app is available on the Google Play store and Apple App Store. Fujifilm’s Instax Share SP-3 printer is available from Outdoorphoto for R3,525, and a 10-pack of Fujifilm Instax Square Instant Film is priced at R195.
