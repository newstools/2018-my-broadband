The Southern Africa Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (SATNAC) is set to take place from 2-5 September 2018. SATNAC will take place at The Arabella Hotel and Spa near Hermanus in the Western Cape, attracting hundreds of delegates across various industries in the ICT sector. When it started 21 years ago, the conference originally focused on student presentations and took place at the University of Cape Town. It has since grown to encompass a number of industries. The theme of this year’s conference will be “The Data Tsunami – Enable through Software Defined Transformation” and will feature Wits Vice-Chancellor Adam Habib, Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko, and Wits WBS Digital Chair Brian Armstrong as speakers. More than 200 delegates have confirmed their attendance at SATNAC 2018 and remaining delegate packages are currently very limited. Attendees must complete delegate registration on the SATNAC website. SATNAC is hosted by Telkom, and major sponsors include Huawei, Openserve, and ZTE.
