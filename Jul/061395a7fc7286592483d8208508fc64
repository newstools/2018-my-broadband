Starting today, Google is rolling out the latest version of its web browser – Chrome 68 – which automatically flags HTTP websites as not secure. According to Microsoft regional director and HaveIBeenPwned operator Troy Hunt, a large portion of the Internet is still serving websites over HTTP, despite knowing about the changes for a long period of time. In a statement on his blog, Hunt said he has created a list of the most popular websites which continue to use HTTP, sorted by country. “We’ve known this has been coming for a long time now both through observing the changes in the industry and Google specifically saying this is coming,” said Hunt. “Yet somehow, we’ve arrived at today with a sizeable chunk of the web still serving traffic insecurely.” Hunt’s Why No HTTPS? website lists the most popular websites according to their Alexa ranking which have not implemented HTTPS. According to Cloudflare, the majority of the Internet’s one million most popular websites will show up as “not secure”, as they are not served over HTTPS. The majority of the Internet’s top 1M most popular sites will show up as “Not Secure” in @GoogleChrome starting July 24th. Make sure your site redirects to #HTTPS, so you don’t have the same problem. @Cloudflare makes it easy! #SecureOnChrome https://t.co/G2a0gi2aM8 pic.twitter.com/r2HWkfRofW — Cloudflare (@Cloudflare) July 23, 2018
