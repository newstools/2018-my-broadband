Smartphones are becoming increasingly powerful, and many devices released in the first half of 2018 are pushing the boundaries of handheld performance. This year’s flagship devices pack impressive amounts of performance into their sleek cases, and with the upcoming release of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 processor and new iPhones, they are only expected to improve. To see how powerful these smartphones are compared to one another, however, benchmarks like Sling Shot Unlimited are a good place to start. The benchmark measures the performance of a smartphone’s hardware, and provides a single number which can be compared across multiple devices. Apple’s iPhones were at the top of the pack in 2017, but have since been overtaken by Android flagships with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 and 845 chips. It is important to note that benchmark scores for Samsung Galaxy devices with Exynos processors – which are the versions sold in South Africa – were not produced. Devices not available in South Africa were excluded from the comparison.
