EOH Holdings has appointed Stephen van Coller as its new chief executive officer. Van Coller will join EOH from 1 September 2018, following the end of his term as an MTN group executive. He previously held the positions of VP: Strategy and Mergers and Acquisitions, and VP: Digital Services, Data Analytics and Business development at MTN. “The board of directors of EOH Holdings is delighted to confirm the appointment of a CEO of Stephen’s calibre,” said EOH. The move follows EOH’s recent announcement it will reconfigure the group into two distinct businesses – EOH and NEXTEC – each with its own CEO. “The creation of the two independent businesses means that the EOH Holdings corporate structure will be responsible for corporate finance, corporate strategy, group reporting, investor relations, and risk and compliance,” said EOH. Zunaid Mayet is the CEO of NEXTEC, while Rob Godlonton is the CEO of the EOH-branded business.
