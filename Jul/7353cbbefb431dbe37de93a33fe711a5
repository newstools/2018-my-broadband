Netflix has improved its episode downloading functionality with the launch of its new Smart Downloads feature. After updating compatible devices with the new feature, Netflix will automatically delete your downloaded shows after you have finished watching them. Netflix will also begin downloading the next episode for viewing after the previous one has finished playing. The company said the aim of the new downloading features is to remove the hassle of navigating through files and deleting download episodes manually. Users can disable the new feature if they want to keep the episodes they have watched on their device. Netflixâ€™s Smart Downloads will initially only be available on Android smartphones and tablets.
