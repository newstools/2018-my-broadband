Huawei plans to launch the world’s first foldable smartphone, according to a report from Nikkei. This follows reports that Samsung is working on a foldable smartphone of its own, recently unveiling its flexible and “unbreakable” OLED display. According to the report, Huawei will also use a flexible OLED panel for its foldable smartphone – with its display manufactured by BOE Technology Group. Sources told Nikkei that Huawei’s first batch of foldable smartphones will be relatively small, but will launch before Samsung rolls out its own foldable device. “Huawei’s planned volume could be limited to some 20,000 to 30,000 units, or even less, for a small group of first-wave adopters,” said sources. “The effort is mainly to demonstrate its technology capability and to attract the industry’s attention and media coverage.” Huawei’s foldable smartphone could reportedly launch in the beginning of 2019.
