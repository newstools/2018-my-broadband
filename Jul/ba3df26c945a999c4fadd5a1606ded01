MyBroadband’s Q2 2018 Internet service provider rankings reveal that Cybersmart is the top-rated service provider in South Africa. The ISP rankings are based on thousands of consumer ratings on the MyBroadband Speed Test platform. Over the last three months, 714,608 speed tests were performed on MyBroadband’s Speed Test platform. MyBroadband’s HTML5 speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure a neutral testing environment. Many of the users who perform speed tests also rate the service which they receive from their ISP, which is a new feature recently added to the platform. Users can rate their ISP on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. The Q2 2018 results show that Cybersmart is the top-rated ISP, with a score of 4.38, followed closely by Cool Ideas on 4.37, and CipherWave on 4.27. The table below provides an overview of the ratings of South Africa’s top ISPs.
