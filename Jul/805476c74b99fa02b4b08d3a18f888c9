The NAG LAN is set to return to the rAge expo in October 2018, and will feature a number of improvements. The event is the largest BYOC (Bring Your Own Computer) LAN is South Africa, seeing gamers attending from all over the country along with their gaming rigs, laptops, and consoles. Gamers will be able to enjoy high-speed Internet and high-intensity esports competitions over a total of 52 hours. Tickets for the LAN will go on sale on 28 July 2018 at 09:00 from Computicket and buyers can choose which part of the LAN area to purchase a ticket for. “For the first time ever, gamers will be able to pre-select their preferred experience in three dedicated LAN areas when purchasing their tickets,” said rAge owner Michael James. “Two of the areas will be fully carpeted, one area will have padded chairs, and two areas will be quieter and more secluded from the noisy expo show floor – ensuring that the NAG LAN experience is more tailored to everyone’s individual tastes and levels of comfort.” NAG LAN participants will also be able to sleep underneath or next to their gaming tables and will not be disturbed by security. The changes to the NAG LAN allow for a bigger rAge show floor with more exhibitions and activities on offer this year, aded James. Tickets for the NAG LAN are priced at R700 per person, and include access to the expo.
