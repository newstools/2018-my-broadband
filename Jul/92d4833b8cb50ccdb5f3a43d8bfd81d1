Slack has acquired Missions, a Slack app which allows users to automate simple tasks without code. The app runs in the chat platform and is one of the 1,500 integrated apps available in Slack. Missions allows users who are not developers to build custom integrations and automate routine work. Slack said Missions can be used across a variety of scenarios, from streamlining the on-boarding of a new employee to managing candidate approvals and rejections. “The Missions team has built on Slack for a long time, and they are deeply familiar with our product and our customers’ needs,” said Slack platform GM Brian Elliott. “Together, we’ll be able to unlock the power of the platform for a whole new set of Slack users, and ultimately help teams get work done more quickly.” While it is integrating Missions into its platform, Slack will support existing Missions customers free of charge.
