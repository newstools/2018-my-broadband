Rain has confirmed that all active fixed-LTE users will receive free off-peak data from 1 December 2018. Rain made the statement to MyBroadband following information from an industry player about the bonus data. Subscribers will receive off-peak data from 23:00 to 18:00 – a period of 19 hours – each day, on top of their anytime data allocation. For example: if you are a subscriber with a 55GB package, you will receive 55GB anytime data, and an extra 55GB off-peak data to use between 23:00 to 18:00. Rain stated that the off-peak data allocation will not specifically be subject to shaping, but it reserves the right to manage its network, both in peak and off-peak times, to ensure a good experience for all its users. The off-peak data announcement comes after Rain announced in July that it will suspend the sale of its fixed-LTE products through partner ISPs due to capacity constraints on its network from 1 November 2018. November also marks the end of Rain’s fixed-LTE double-data promotion, which saw users who signed up for Rain packages in 2017 receive a double data allocation. The double-data promotion is set to end on 30 November. Rain Mobile offers users a similar off-peak data option, but the mobile version is “unlimited” data and costs R250 per month.
