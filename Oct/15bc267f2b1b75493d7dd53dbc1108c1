Speaking at the 2018 MyBroadband Conference, Q-KON CEO Dawie De Wet detailed the potential applications of the company’s new satellite broadband offering. Q-KON’s broadband offering is named Twoobii, and is a “3G-anywhere” broadband solution which works over an end-to-end satellite connection. De Wet explained that this satellite network is a lot simpler than traditional mobile broadband networks, with connections only comprising three points. “Satellite is an end-to-end solution, you have the satellite, an uplink station, and a terminal on the customer’s side,” he said. De Wet said that Twoobii is positioned as a business product, specifically aimed at off-grid businesses in locations without other broadband coverage. “If your business is off-grid and not connected, call us,” he said. Q-KON’s Twoobii service will offer 30GB data bundles for R1,500, which works out to R50 per GB. De Wet said that the broadband offering is not aimed at consumers, but it has a number of applications for small and large businesses. “Applications include backup connections, packet data applications, and business broadband for off-grid locations,” he said. Through a partnership with Intelsat, Q-KON’s Twoobii product offers users voice, data, and Internet services anywhere they are in South Africa. Users can find out more about Q-KON’s satellite broadband offering on the official Twoobii website.
