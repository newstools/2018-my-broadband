Samsung is working on a batch of new smartphones, including a gaming device, reported Softpedia News. The report stated that a gaming smartphone is already in the works at Samsung, and will be the “PlayStation” of smartphones. It is suggested that Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones will be used as a base for the device, which will then be optimised for gaming. This will mean more storage and a bigger battery than current reference devices. The display will also be key, as games require fast refresh rates and sharp visuals. The news comes after Huawei recently launched its Mate 20 X, which the company said can take on the Nintendo Switch as a gaming platform.
