Google has unveiled its latest Chrome OS device, the Pixel Slate. The tablet was called the future of Chrome OS by Google at its hardware event this evening, and features a thin and lightweight design. “For life at work and at play, we’re bringing the power and productivity of a desktop to a gorgeous tablet called Pixel Slate. This Chrome OS device is both a powerful workstation at the office, and a home theater you can hold in your hands,” said Google. It features a high-resolution 12.3-inch screen, 8MP camera, and front-facing speakers for crisp sound. Users can also purchase a stylus to use on the Slate’s touchscreen, along with a Pixel Slate keyboard attachment. The keyboard connects to the tablet and lets users use the device as a laptop, and features a full keyboard and trackpad layout. The specifications of the Pixel Slate are listed below. The Pixel Slate will be available in a number of configurations, starting from $599 and going up to $1,599, shipping later this year. The keyboard attachment is $199, while the Pen sells for $99.
