The AA has stated that it expects the petrol price to decrease in November. “Fuel prices have moderated during October, with the prospect of some relief for petrol users, although users of diesel and illuminating paraffin will have to cough up more,” said the AA. This is based on unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund. “The exchange rate started the month badly, but has since levelled out,” added the AA. The expected changes are: “2018 has been one of the most tumultuous years in history for South African fuel users, and the economy is still fragile and easily spooked,” said the AA.
