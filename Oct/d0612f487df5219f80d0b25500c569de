The Federal Office for Information Security in Germany (BSI) has announced that Huawei will open an information security lab in Bonn, Reuters reported. Among the functions of the lab will be to enable source reviews, which the report stated was a step aimed at gaining the confidence of the German regulator ahead of the country’s auction of radio frequency spectrum for 5G. These source code reviews will include examinations of the software running on Huawei’s telecommunications network equipment. Reviewers will look for back doors which could secretly allow access to intelligence agencies. Australia has banned Huawei from providing its 5G equipment to networks in the country, while the United States has prevented the Chinese company from participating in certain government contracts, citing concerns over national security. However, Huawei maintains that no inspection has ever found any back doors in its gear.
