Boring Company founder Elon Musk announced on Twitter that the company’s first tunnel is set to be completed before the end of the year. Musk said the tunnel is expected to open to the public on 10 December 2018, with the company hosting a special event at SpaceX where people can try out the system for free. When the tunnel underneath Los Angeles is built, it will be capable of carrying pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists at high speeds underneath the city, circumventing traffic. In addition to this tunnel, the Boring Company is also working on a tunnel between Washington DC and New York. Musk previously stated that the company’s in-city loop system would aim to bypass traffic congestion by offering $1 rides in electric passenger pods through its tunnel network.
