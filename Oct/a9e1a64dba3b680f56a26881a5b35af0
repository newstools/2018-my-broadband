Facebook is testing a new feature for its Messenger app which will allow users to unsend messages, TechCrunch reports. The unsend option will allow Messenger users to delete sent messages from their own inbox as well as their recipient’s inbox. Code within the Messenger app for Android shows how Facebook’s new feature will work once it is launched to the public. Editing messages within the Messenger app will show an “Unsend Message” option in addition to the standard “Delete Message” button. After choosing to unsend the message, users will be asked to confirm their action, with Messenger notifying them that the message will be removed from the chat for both the sender and recipient. The report stated that there will be a time limit for unsending messages, similar to Gmail’s recently-launched “Undo Send” feature. Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that it was testing the new feature before it officially launched it to all users.
