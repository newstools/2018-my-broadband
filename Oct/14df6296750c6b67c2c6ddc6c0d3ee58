Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook have said they will object to a proposed law in Australia that compels them to provide access to private encrypted data when served with a warrant, Reuters reported. Under the proposed legislation, fines of up to A$10 million (R100 million) for institutions and prison time for individuals will apply for failure to comply a court order to decrypt data for law enforcement. “Any kind of attempt by interception agencies, as they are called in the bill, to create tools to weaken encryption is a huge risk to our digital security,” said Lizzie O’Shea, spokeswoman for the Alliance for a Safe and Secure Internet. The Australian government said the proposed law is necessary due to increased risk of terror attacks. MTN and Vodacom have previously argued that services such as WhatsApp should be required to comply with RICA in South Africa, which allows for law enforcement to obtain a court order to intercept a person’s communications.
