Google unveiled its new Home Hub smart device at its MadeByGoogle 2018 hardware launch event this evening. The Home Hub is powered by Google Assistant and is compatible with a number of platforms, including devices running Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, and Chrome OS. The device sports a 7-inch LCD touchscreen along with far-field microphones for accurate voice recognition and a full-range speaker for high-fidelity audio playback. Google’s Home Hub automatically adjusts its settings depending on your behaviour and the time of day, and can be set up to intelligently display your cloud-stored photos. The Google home Hub is available in four colours – Sand, Aqua, Charcoal, and Chalk – and is available for pre-order from the Google Store. The device is priced at $149 and will ship from 22 October 2018.
