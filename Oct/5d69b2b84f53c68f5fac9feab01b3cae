AMD’s new line-up of Ryzen Threadripper chips are positioned to take on Intel’s high-end processors. The chips boast high core and thread counts, and are compatible with AMD’s X399 chipset, catering to the high-end desktop and enthusiast market. AMD unveiled four Threadripper 2 chips earlier this year with varying core counts levels of performance. While the Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX and 2950X released in August 2018, the Threadripper 2970WX and 2920X are only being made available now. The specifications of all four chips are listed below. Reviews of the 2920X and 2970WX are appearing online, detailing the performance of the new chips. Benchmarks from HotHardware show that AMD’s latest high-end desktop chips compete squarely with Intel’s more expensive processors and have several advantages in some areas. The 2920X and 2970WX boast better multi-threaded performance than competing chips, with the Threadripper 2920X outperforming Intel’s more expensive Core i9-7900X in multi-threaded tasks. However, AMD’s Ryzen Threadripper 2 chips still fall short of Intel’s competing products in single-threaded performance.
