Comic Con has been a staple of Western geek culture for years, and this year it finally arrived in South Africa. South Africans pulled through to the Kyalami International Convention Centre in their thousands to attend the official Comic Con Africa event. The event was hosted by Reed Exhibitions Africa, and featured a number of the attractions seen at international conventions, including celebrity panels and high-quality cosplay. Locals were also treated to the 2018 rAge Expo just a few weeks later, which played host to the popular NAG BYOC LAN. Both events were very well-attended, and foreshadow a great future for geek and gaming events in South Africa. Reed Exhibitions Africa labelled the first Comic Con Africa event as an “unprecedented success”, attracting over 45,000 fans over the course of the weekend. “Africa’s inaugural Comic Con has wrapped up and it exceeded even our wildest expectations,” Reed Exhibitions Africa MD Carol Weaving said. “The three-day gathering of gamers, cosplayers, pop culture fanatics, and comic book enthusiasts has ignited a magical fire on the African continent.” Subsequently, Comic Con Africa will be returning to Johannesburg in 2019. The turnout for rAge 2018 was also very large, but it was slightly lower than it was in 2017. A total of 34,002 people attended this year’s rAge expo, which featured a redesigned LAN space and a large floor space for exhibitors. “We hosted a few large-scale casual esports tournaments that saw permanent queues the entire weekend, as well as some very happy winners,” said Michael James, the owner of rAge. He attributed the slightly lower attendance figures to the entry of newcomers like Comic Con Africa, but said that this impact was negligible. rAge is set to take place again from 27-29 September in 2019.
