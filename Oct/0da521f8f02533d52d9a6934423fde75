Mercedes-Benz has unveiled pricing for its top-of-line X-Class bakkie, the X350d V6 4×4 Power. The company also revealed pricing for the slightly cheaper V6 model, the X350d Progressive. Both models produce 190kW of power, have automatic transmissions, and 4×4 drive – and are priced as follows: Following the unveiling of the pricing for the V6 X-Class, the first question South African readers asked was: “Can it beat a Toyota Hilux?” The Toyota Hilux, particularly the double-cab bakkie, is an icon in South Africa and the choice of many off-road users. The Hilux has been around for much longer than the X-Class, although it may be argued that the Mercedes-Benz bakkie is more than a utilitarian vehicle and is not a direct competitor. With its German pedigree, Mercedes-Benz badge, and high price tag, the X-Class not only fills the 4×4 role, but is a luxury vehicle with status attached to it. Nonetheless, to see how the two V6 X-Class models compare against the top-of-the-range Hilux double-cabs, we have detailed their pricing and specifications in the table below. As you can see, the bakkies deliver similar power, towing, and load-carrying capabilities. The X-Class has slightly more power and torque, and a higher payload rating, but all can tow 3 tonnes (braked). All the vehicles offer automatic transmission, while the Hilux – in its Raider variant – is available in either petrol or diesel. The X-Class is only available in diesel. Where the differences really come into play, however, is price. The Hilux is substantially cheaper than the X-Class and users can save over R300,000 if they opt for the Toyota bakkie instead of the Mercedes-Benz model.
