Security advocate Jerry Gamblin has discovered glaring security issues with Google’s Home Hub device, labelling the device’s security as extremely poor. The Home Hub is a Google Assistant-enabled smart speaker with a large LCD display that is capable of controlling connected smart devices and fulfilling a range of assistant-related tasks. Gamblin discovered that a simple unauthenticated set of instructions could be sent to the Google Home Hub forcing it to reboot or perform other tasks. He was also able to execute a number of other unauthenticated commands, which could do everything from deleting network settings on the device to disabling all notifications. Another command line forces all devices on the network to lose their network settings, prompting a manual setup to reconnect the devices. There are no security issues that could permanently damage hardware or directly obtain private information, but Gamblin noted that the security problems are alarming for products made by Google.
