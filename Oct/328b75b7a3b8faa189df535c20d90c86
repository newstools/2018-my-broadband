Facebook has started rolling out a new, simplified version of its messaging app for mobile. Messenger 4 has been rebuilt to offer a simpler interface and easier navigation, with the number of tabs reduced from nine to three. All conversations and communication features are grouped under the Chats tab, friends and Stories are now found under the People tab, and the Discover tab features offerings from businesses, games, news, and more. Messenger users can now use colour gradients to customise their chat bubbles within conversations, and these can be changed at any time. Facebook said it would roll out its redesigned Messenger app in phases, and plans to introduce a number of new features in the near future, including Dark Mode.
