Huawei has launched its Mate 20 Pro smartphone in South Africa, which is the first in the company’s line-up to sport its 7nm Kirin 980 processor – and is now available for pre-order. The Mate 20 Pro is a high-end, powerful smartphone, and it features a number of hardware changes compared to previous models – including a redesigned camera system. It features a triple-lens Leica camera system that is located on the rear of the device’s chassis, and it sports a curved OLED display which boasts an impressive 3,120 x 1,440 resolution. The device features a number of software-enhanced AI features integrated with its camera system, which automatically optimise shots depending on the subject in the frame. One of the most-impressive features on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is its large 4,200mAh battery and its capability to be used as a portable power bank for other devices, thanks to its glass back and unique charging hardware. The Huawei Mate 20 Pro will start shipping in South Africa from 31 October 2018, and can be pre-ordered now for a recommended retail price of R18,999. You can now pre-order the Mate 20 Pro from Huawei’s dedicated promotion page, and those who pre-order it before 31 October will receive a free Huawei Watch GT valued at R5,499 along with their smartphone. This special offer is only available to the first 500 customers who place successful pre-orders. The Huawei Mate 20 Pro will also be available on 24-month contracts from Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, and Telkom.  This article was published in partnership with Huawei.
