Sony has revealed the full list of games coming to its PlayStation Classic console. The company unveiled its retro gaming console last month, announcing that it would ship with a chassis that is 45% smaller than the original console and will be pre-loaded with 20 classic titles. Two controllers will also be included with the console, along with an HDMI connection to support modern TV hardware. “For all of us at PlayStation, it was so exciting to see the positive response from the community to last month’s PlayStation Classic announcement,” the company said. “Today, we are happy to reveal the entire line-up of the 20 games that come pre-loaded on the console when it launches in the US and Canada on December 3.” Below is the full list of games that will be included with the PlayStation Classic console. The PlayStation Classic is available for pre-order in the US for $99.99.
