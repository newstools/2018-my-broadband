When Apple launched the iPhone X in September 2017, people spoke about two things: Face ID and the “notch” display design. The Face ID system was mocked by some, particularly because the device did not have a fingerprint sensor. This conversation was much quieter than the notch design debate, however. Many were quick to call the notch design ugly and outright dumb, with big publications like The Verge describing it as “an odd design choice”. Consumers were also quoted as saying “if Steve Jobs was alive, he would have never let this happen”. Fast forward a year, and there is a long list of Android smartphones makers which have copied the notch design and incorporated it into their new devices. This includes the likes of Huawei and Google. Apple has also released its new iPhone Xs devices which feature a similar notch design. The list below shows which phones have adopted the design.         One of the big players who has stayed away from the notch design trend is Samsung.
