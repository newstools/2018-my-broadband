Carriers are readying for the launch of iOS 12.1 on 30 October which will provide eSIM support for the new iPhones, according to 9to5Mac. Apple’s Dual-SIM Dual-Standby system – comprising one physical nano-SIM and one eSIM – lets owners use cellphone numbers and mobile data services from two networks in the same iPhone, where the phone will answer calls from both numbers automatically. For the iPhone Xs debut last month, the eSIM features were not available yet, but they will be included in the iOS 12.1 update. US and EU carriers have reportedly been briefed to begin deploying eSIM contracts from 30 October, at which time users will be able to download iOS 12.1. Apple users will be able to scan a special QR code with their iPhone Xs, Xs Max, or Xr to set up the eSIM. This scan automatically fills in the necessary account information, and activates the eSIM for the user. One clue that the public release of iOS 12.1 is coming soon is an update Apple made to the iOS 12 user guide that included acknowledgement of iOS 12.1 features. The new features of iOS 12.1 go beyond the inclusion of eSIM functionality, also adding more than 70 new emoji, live depth control so you can adjust bokeh blur of portrait mode in the camera viewfinder, as well as the addition of Group FaceTime. It is also expected that the new iPad Pro hardware will ship with iOS 12.1, which will enable features like landscape Face ID unlock, and Memoji sync – which lets you share the same set of custom Animoji between your various iOS devices.
