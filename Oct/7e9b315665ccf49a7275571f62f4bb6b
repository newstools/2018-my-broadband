Comic Con is a much-loved event around the world, and it finally landed in South Africa this year with the first-ever Comic Con Africa. South Africans flocked to the Kyalami International Convention Centre from all across the country to the official Comic Con event hosted by Reed Exhibitions Africa. Comic Con Africa featured a number of the attractions normally seen at international conventions, including celebrity panels, the Artist Alley, and high-quality cosplay. Weeks later, South Africans were treated to the annual rAge gaming expo. rAge 2018 saw an attendance of 34,002 people walking through its doors, but Comic Con Africa pulled a larger attendance – more than 45,000 people. Despite its high attendance, however, Comic Con Africa pales in comparison to similar events held around the world. MyBroadband compared these South African attendance numbers to those of major geek and gaming events held around the world. Some of the more well-known events include the likes of Blizzcon, E3, San Diego Comic Con, and Gamescom. Some bigger events that may not be as well-known include the likes of the giant comic market – called Comiket – that takes place in Tokyo, Japan. It is a monstrous event that happens in the streets of Tokyo, pulling in upwards of 35,000 “Dojin circles” – groups that self-publish their work – and 550,000 attendees. The attendance numbers for some of the biggest gaming and geek conventions in the world are compared in the table below and listed in ascending order.
