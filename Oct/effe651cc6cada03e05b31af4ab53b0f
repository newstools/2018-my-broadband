Showmax is more popular than Netflix in South Africa, according to a recent survey. The finding was stated in the Broadcast Research Council of South Africa products and brands report for October 2018, looking at services in South Africa. The survey was taken by 3,154 people between January and June 2018, with 70% of respondents in metros, 15% in urban areas, and 15% rural. The split was then re-weighted to the population of South Africa (41%, 28%, and 31%, respectively). Socio-Economic Measure (SEM) groups were also differentiated in the report. According to the streaming section of the report, Showmax is more popular than Netflix in South Africa in the period measured.
