Apple has unveiled a new MacBook Air at an event in New York. Apple said the MacBook Air is the most-loved laptop from Apple, and the new Air is the perfect device for portable use. The new MacBook Air features a 13.3-inch Retina Display with 4 million pixels, with a sleek new design and narrow borders around the screen. The FaceTime camera will remain at the top of the display, however. Apple has also included TouchID for fingerprint unlock on the laptop, and a T2 security chip for a secure boot process. The latest keyboard from Apple with individual LED backlighting has also been fitted to the new Air, along with a Force Touch trackpad with increased surface area. Stereo speakers – which promise to deliver good sound and bass – and a three microphone array have also been added. Inside the Air users can find up to an 8th-Gen Intel Core i5 CPU, 16GB of 2,133MHz RAM, and 1.5TB SSD storage. Visuals are taken care of by Intel UHD Graphics. Connectivity is then taken care of via two Thunderbolt 3 ports with USB-C interfaces. Its battery promises 12 hours of wireless web browsing and 13 hours of video playback, thanks to this hardware, added Apple. The size of the MacBook Air has also been improved, and the latest model has 17% less volume than its predecessor. It is 15.6mm thick, which is 10% thinner than the previous Air, weighs 1.24kg, and is made from 100% recycled aluminium. Apple said the new MacBook Air starts at $1,199, and orders are open from today. It will then ship from 7 November, with gold, space grey, and silver colour options.
