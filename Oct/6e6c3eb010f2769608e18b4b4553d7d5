A recent survey by WinMagic shows that 30% of IT pros don’t know when older versions of Windows will no longer be supported. 29% of respondents were also found to be “fairly or very concerned about the migration process” to Windows 10 – with 68% of this group citing potential security breaches as their main concern. Only 34% of respondents had no concerns whatsoever about the migration process. A third of those surveyed also did not know whether they had every tool required to migrate to Windows 10. Windows 7 will stop being supported at the beginning of 2020, at which point only Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 will receive updates from Microsoft. “The clock is ticking and if organisations don’t move fast they could find themselves scrabbling last minute to deliver a seamless and secure migration to Windows 10,” said WinMagic vice president of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, Luke Brown. Windows 7 is still the most popular Windows operating system for desktop PCs, although Windows 10 is close to taking over this mantle.
