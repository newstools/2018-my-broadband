BT-SA, a well-known ICT infrastructure company, is expanding their Cape Town offices in order to continue offering the exceptional service the city has come to know and expect from them. The company, which first opened its doors in the mother city in 1990, is soon moving to larger premises just off Umuramba Road in Montague Gardens to accommodate the growing infrastructure demands in the Western Cape. BT-SA has had a great deal of success in the Western Cape, from a 10Gig fibre backbone installation for one of the city’s most prominent hospitals to security infrastructure on a renowned abalone farm. End-to-end infrastructure solutions include design, installation and maintenance of all data network, wireless communications, air-conditioning, electrical and security solutions. “We know that effective infrastructure management may present a challenge, which is why we ensure that everything runs smoothly from fibre connections to employee safety.  Our goal is to provide infrastructure solutions for any scale business. We continue to bring our skills, expertise and excellent service to businesses in the Western Cape,” says Amiena Carelse, recently appointed Branch Manager of BT-SA Cape Town. “BT-SA has evolved since inception in 1982 as one of SA’s most dynamic and specialised ICT infrastructure companies, assisting businesses to seamlessly integrate their ICT infrastructure to meet their ICT needs. The digital revolution is having an impact on the facilities management industry, and today, a building is no longer just a building – it’s a humming machine” says Lawrence Weitzman, Director of BT-SA. “While expanding will offer tremendous opportunities for new and existing business, our commitment to provide world-class ICT solutions and deliver even better service to Cape Town and surrounding areas will never change,” Weitzman concludes.
