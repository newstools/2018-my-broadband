The Ticketpro Dome saw a massive turnout of gamers, geeks, and cosplayers at rAge expo 2018. This year’s showcase of tech and geek culture saw 34,002 people walk through the doors, all ready for their chance to witness cosplay, games, and geek culture. MWEB provided an 8Gbps line to the expo, where they recorded 120TB of data in downloads, and 15TB in uploads. With a repositioning of the LAN, there was a large amount of floor-space left open for more tech and gaming merchandise to be put on display, added the organisers. “We hosted a few large-scale casual esports tournaments that saw permanent queues the entire weekend, as well as some very happy winners,” said Michael James, the owner of rAge. Many retailers also reported selling out of their stock on the first day. Despite the large turnout, James said the attendance figures were slightly down from previous years – which he attributed to the entry of newcomers like Comic Con Africa into the market. “Everything considered, though, the impact on rAge was negligible,” James added. rAge will take place again next year, set for 27-29 September 2019.
