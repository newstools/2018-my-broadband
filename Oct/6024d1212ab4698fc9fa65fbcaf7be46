Google has revealed its new Project Stream platform, which it said is a technical test to solve the challenges of online game streaming. The company has partnered with Ubisoft to stream Assassin’s Creed Odyssey to the Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop. “Starting on October 5, a limited number of participants will get to play the latest in this best-selling franchise at no charge for the duration of the Project Stream test,” Google said. The company stated that there were a number of technical challenges involved in streaming a game to a browser, including minimising latency between user inputs and on-screen graphics. Users who are interested in trying out Project Stream can sign up for one of the limited spots available on the platform’s official website. The service is currently only available to users in the United States.
