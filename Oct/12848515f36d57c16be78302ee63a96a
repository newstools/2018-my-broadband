Samsung has launched its new Galaxy A9 smartphone, which sports the world’s first mobile quad-camera system. The Galaxy A9 2018 features a similar design to the triple-camera Galaxy A7 released earlier this year, although its fingerprint sensor is mounted on the back of its chassis instead of the side. Samsung’s quad-camera smartphone is capable of taking ultra-wide, 120-degree panoramic shots and also boasts 2x optical zoom. The four lenses comprising the Galaxy A9’s camera system includes 24MP PDAF, 8MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto, and 5MP depth sensors. This allows for a variety of different shooting modes, as well as customised shots using features like artificial bokeh effects. Samsung has also included a number of flagship features in its Galaxy A9 device, such as its Infinity Display, Bixby assistant, and support for Samsung Pay. The company’s new Galaxy A9 smartphone is available in Caviar Black, Lemonade Blue, and Bubblegum Pink. The Samsung Galaxy A9 will be released in selected markets from November 2018. There is currently no pricing information available for the device.
