Telkom has the happiest mobile data customers and Vodacom has the unhappiest with regards to mobile data prices, according to the BMIT Digital Consumer Survey 2018. The survey collected data from over 1,250 South African consumers, all of whom had an active SIM and used mobile data. “The mobile service providers with the unhappiest customers regarding data prices were Vodacom followed by MTN, which had 60% and 55% of their customers respectively reporting that they felt that their service provider’s mobile data prices were expensive or very expensive,” the BMIT reported stated. The study also found that 46% of consumers think their mobile service provider’s data prices are either expensive or very expensive. Only 28% of respondents said they thought their operator’s data prices were cheap or very cheap. “In fact, Telkom was the only service provider which had a greater percentage of customers who feel their data prices are cheap as compared to those that feel that it is expensive,” the study found. 46% of Telkom customer felt that the operator’s data prices were cheap, while only 21% said they were expensive. BMIT also studied the data usage of customers, finding that users who could not afford a lot of mobile data restricted their app usage accordingly. The biggest observation of this phenomenon can be seen in the usage of the Uber, News24, and Twitter apps. Consumers who use under 1GB of mobile data per month, use Uber and News24 51% less than those who use more data each month. Other demanding apps such as YouTube and Instagram also saw a large drop in relative usage among South Africans with lower data usage.
