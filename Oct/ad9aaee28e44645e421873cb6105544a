Oculus announced that the latest version of its Rift Core software is now rolling out to VR users worldwide. Rift Core 2.0 was previously available in beta to a number of VR headset owners, but is now rolling out to all systems. The latest version of the software includes performance improvements, UI updates, and new social features. Oculus has overhauled the interface for Rift Core 2.0 by including more 3D objects and improved rendering, while also allowing users to hang out online with up to eight friends. The included Dash virtual desktop allows VR users to easily interact with their Windows desktop from within a virtual environment. The company added that its Oculus Home and Dash interfaces now run smoothly on machines with both recommended and minimum specifications.
