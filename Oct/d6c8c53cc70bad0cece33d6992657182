Samsung unveiled its Galaxy A9 smartphone yesterday, calling it the first smartphone to have a quad-camera system. The device packs an array of impressive features, including a 6.3-inch AMOLED display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor, 128GB internal storage, 6GB of RAM, LTE connectivity, a 24MP front camera, and a 3,800mAh battery. These specifications were not the focus of users, however, as all attention was on the four-camera system mounted on the rear of the phone. A common question was: Are four cameras really necessary? The answer, according to Samsung, is yes. Samsung Galaxy A9’s rear camera system consists of an “Ultra Wide Camera, Telephoto Camera, 24MP Camera, and a Depth Camera”. This lets users “capture dynamic and beautiful photos effortlessly”. “With four lenses, experience even more ways to unleash your creativity, and capture, create and share stunning images,” said Samsung. The four sensors have the following specifications: This, combined with AI Scene Recognition and Scene Optimizer, will let users “shoot like a pro” and manually manage a photo’s depth of field. Samsung said there are 19 modes available with Scene Optimizer. These are: Food, Portraits, Flowers, Indoor scenes, Animals, Landscapes, Greenery, Trees, Sky, Mountains, Beaches, Sunrises and sunsets, Watersides, Street scenes, Night scenes, Waterfalls, Snow, Birds, and Text. The system also features flaw detection, which picks up if a subject blinks when their photo is taken, if there is facial blur, and if backlighting is off. The company added that blink and blur detection works best “when there are three or fewer people in the frame, 1.5 metres or closer to the camera”. In summary, having four cameras that perform different roles allow a user to take better photos across a wide range of settings – whether it be a low-light shot of a close-up subject, or a well-lit landscape image.
