The ANC has launched a new website after reportedly failing to pay for its old one. The new website – anc1912.org.za – was put online after its previous website – anc.org.za – was taken down due to non-payment. Media reports stated that the website was taken down as the ANC owed service provider Unwembi Communications R32.5 million for the running of the site. The ANC denied it was in a dispute with the company which hosted its website. Following this, however, the ANC took to Twitter this afternoon to unveil its new website. The registrar of the anc1912.org.za domain is listed as Afrihost on the ZA Central Registry.
