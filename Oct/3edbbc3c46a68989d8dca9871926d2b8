Telkom recently unveiled its Big Deal for October, featuring a fixed-LTE SmartBroadband Wireless package with extra data. The SmartBroadband Wireless 10GB package includes 40GB of anytime data, 20GB of Night surfer data (midnight – 07:00), and a Huawei B525 LTE router. The price – R359 per month. The only “catch” is that this service requires users to sign a 24-month contract with Telkom. While the price may be attractive, the requirement of signing a 24-month contract will not appeal to certain users. Fortunately, local ISPs offer competing fixed-LTE services that do not require a contract and are available on a month-to-month basis. Afrihost, for example, sells LTE services from Cell C and Rain, with varying monthly data allotments on offer at different price points. While there are no long contracts, users are subject to a cancellation policy. Afrihost states that if users cancel their fixed-LTE package within the first six months, they will be charged a R999 fee. To see how Telkom’s Big Deal for October compares to Cell C and Rain’s packages, we have detailed the services in the table below. Telkom, Rain, and Cell C’s LTE packages all offer similar speeds, with their respective websites measuring averages between 10-70Mbps. It must be noted that the Rain and Cell C deals through Afrihost also offer the option of a Huawei B618 router. This costs R999 once-off.
