Microsoft announced that it has started rolling out its October 2018 update for Xbox One consoles. The update is currently rolling out to Xbox One owners worldwide and includes a number of new features, such as new Xbox Avatars, and support for five new languages within the Narrator tool. Microsoft has added an Xbox Skill for Cortana and Alexa, which allows gamers to interact with their Xbox through Cortana and Alexa-enabled devices. Xbox owners with compatible digital assistants can use voice commands to launch games, turn on their device, take screenshots, and more. The update also adds support for Dolby Vision HDR streaming for both the Xbox One X and Xbox One S. This feature allows supported TVs to deliver enhanced HDR images, and is currently supported by the Netflix app for Xbox.
