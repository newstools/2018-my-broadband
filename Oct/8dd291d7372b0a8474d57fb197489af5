Elon Musk has posted a tweet about the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission” doing incredible work. The tweet ends with “the name change is so on point”, which appears to be a reference to the SEC – mocking the agency. The SEC – Securities and Exchange Commision – recently spearheaded a lawsuit against Musk for his tweets about taking Tesla public at $420 a share. Musk was subsequently forced to give up his position as Tesla chairman and pay a $20-million penalty to settle fraud charges. Neither Tesla nor Musk admitted wrongdoing under the settlement, which was reached two days after the regulator sued, stated Bloomberg. Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 4, 2018
