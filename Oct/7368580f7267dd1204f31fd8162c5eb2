ISPA regulatory advisor Dominic Cull has heavily criticised ICASA’s new call termination rates. ICASA recently announced its new call termination rates for telecoms operators in South Africa, gradually decreasing the amount networks pay each other to terminate calls on their networks. “ICASA’s review of the 2014 Call Termination Regulations has been greeted with silence by the incumbent mobile networks, which is telling,” said Cull. He said that this is due to the “anti-competitive rate regime that favours large operators”. Cull said ISPA objects to the new rates as they “remove any advantage given to smaller fixed-line service providers to compete with dominant incumbent Telkom”. “Where in the world do we find a regulator that takes more than 36 months to complete a notionally pro-competitive intervention and come up with a regime which has obvious anti-competitive consequences?” said Cull. He added that this is only the latest move showing the “ineffectiveness of ICASA”. Other blunders include ICASA’s failure to finalise a framework for porting non-geographic numbers such as 0800 and 0860 numbers, “strengthening the dominance of Telkom”.
