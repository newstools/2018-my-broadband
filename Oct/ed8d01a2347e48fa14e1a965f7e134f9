Instagram is testing a new privacy setting that allows it to share users’ location history with Facebook, TechCrunch reports. The setting would allow user GPS coordinates collected by Instagram to be shared with Facebook to create better targeted ads and content recommendations. This location history option would log location history data from products – including Messenger and Instagram – with Facebook collecting location information even when the application is closed. Speaking to TechCrunch, Facebook confirmed that it has not introduced updates to its location settings yet. “As you know, we often work on ideas that may evolve over time or ultimately not be tested or released,” Facebook said. “Instagram does not currently store Location History; we’ll keep people updated with any changes to our location settings in the future.”
