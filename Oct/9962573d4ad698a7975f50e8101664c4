ICASA’s latest report on cellular tariffs in South Africa shows why buying a small prepaid data bundle is a huge rip-off compared to a large data bundle. The report covered mobile services between 2 January and 30 June 2018, and looked at how prices have changed in the market and how this impacts consumers. “The purpose of the report is to highlight the different tariff plans which were filed and/or existed in the market during the period under review,” said ICASA. Part of the report focused on prepaid mobile data bundles, with 30-day bundles analysed by ICASA. The report found what many users already know – buying a small prepaid data bundle works out much more expensive in terms of per-MB prices when compared to a big data bundle. In the report, ICASA showed the difference in per-MB prices across Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, and Telkom Mobile 30-day data bundles. Bundles from 50MB up to 20GB were examined, revealing that per-MB prices drop sharply as data bundles get bigger. “For example, a Vodacom customer that purchases a 1GB data bundle will pay an in-bundle rate of R0.15 per megabyte, whereas a Vodacom customer that purchases a 20GB data bundle will pay an in-bundle rate of R0.05 per megabyte,” said ICASA. The situation is similar when it comes to MTN, Cell C, and Telkom bundles. The reason for the price decrease is that mobile networks can count on breakage on bigger data bundles. In simpler terms, the network can estimate that not all users who buy a 20GB data bundle will use the full 20GB in 30 days. The ICASA graph below shows how per-MB data prices drop as bundle sizes increase.
