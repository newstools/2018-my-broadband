Following Sars chief officer for digital and IT, Mmamathe Makhekhe-Mokhuane, blundering epically on national TV, South Africans have voiced their anger at incompetent people being put in positions of responsibility and authority. The situation was only worsened when Sars’ latest annual report revealed that Makhekhe-Mokhuane earns well over R3 million a year in her position. This further angered South Africans, who stated that while putting incompetent people in positions of power in government structures damages the country, paying them massive salaries is rubbing salt in the wounds. State-owned entities and organisations overseen by the government also continue to make headlines for all the wrong reasons. From corruption and theft to incompetence and laziness, companies like SAA and Eskom are bleeding money. This does not stop their executives earning big salaries, however – including top IT positions like chief information officers. To see how much top IT executives in state-owned or managed companies earn, we looked at the latest financial results from the organisations and their remuneration details. CIOs at Transnet, SAA, and Sars all make over R3 million per year, according to the reports. The CIO for Eskom, who has performed the role in an acting capacity for 5 months in their past financial year, earned R699,000. This works out to a R1.7-million annual salary. The table below details the annual packages of the IT executives.
