Dell has unveiled its new UltraSharp U4919DW monitor, which is the first 49-inch ultra-wide monitor with QHD resolution. It differs to current 32:9 monitors in that it sports more pixels per inch and is a dual-QHD monitor, with a resolution of 5,120 x 1,440 pixels. It has a 3800R curvature packing 109 pixels-per-inch, and it has 100% sRGB support bringing out accurate colours. On top of the standard support for HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C, the new Dell monitor includes keyboard, video, and mouse (KVM) functionality. What this means is that you can connect one machine to the monitor via USB-C, and a second over HDMI or DisplayPort with a USB upstream. Using Dell’s Display Manager app, you can control both machines using a single set of peripherals. Dell revealed that the monitor will be available from 26 October and will cost $1,699.
