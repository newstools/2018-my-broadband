Oath has announced Yahoo Together, a group messaging app with a focus on organising conversations. Much like Slack, Yahoo’s new mobile messaging app draws inspiration from Internet Relay Chat, a protocol that has been around since 1988. “It’s group chat that makes life easier through organisation and smart tools,” said Oath. “Gather people into the groups you care most about (family, friends, book clubs, bowling leagues) and then split up your conversations with topics. So, instead of talking about 18 things at once, you can follow the topics you care about, and mute the rest.” Yahoo Together allows photo and video sharing, and also lets you attach any file into a shared library for the group. A search function lets you find media in groups later down the line, rather than having to scroll through long chat histories. The app also offers shared calendars, and a mechanism to set up reminders and attach them to any message. This will notify the group at the scheduled time. Yahoo Together is available for iOS and Android. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
