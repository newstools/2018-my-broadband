rAge 2018 kicked off at the Ticketpro Dome in Johannesburg this weekend. The expo takes place from 5-7 October and features a variety of geek and gaming-related activities, from competitive gaming tournaments to PC hardware workshops. rAge 2018 once again hosted the NAG BYOC LAN, which spread from the mezzanine level to the basement of the venue and saw hundreds of gamers competing in their favourite games. The expo is the largest event in the country focused on PC and console gaming, esports, cosplay, and multiple facets of geek culture.
