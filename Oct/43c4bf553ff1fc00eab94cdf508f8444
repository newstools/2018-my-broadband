Boston Dynamics has released a new video showing off its Atlas robot. In the latest video, posted below, Atlas does “parkour”. The robot can be seen jumping over a large log, and then up a series of boxes while remaining stable and in control of its movement. “The control software uses the whole body, including legs, arms and torso, to marshal the energy and strength for jumping over the log and leaping up the steps without breaking its pace,” said Boston Dynamics. “Atlas uses computer vision to locate itself with respect to visible markers on the approach to hit the terrain accurately.” <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
