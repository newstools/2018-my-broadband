The City of Cape Town has announced that it has signed a deal with Cell C for increased public Wi-Fi connectivity in the city. The proposal includes providing Cell C with access to street pole infrastructure, council-owned buildings, and other public spaces – allowing the company to calculate the best way to provide connectivity to the public. Cell C will look at installing Wi-Fi connectivity via street light poles, city buildings, and public transport infrastructure. “Cell C is always looking at ways to bring access to as many South Africans as we can,” said Cell C CEO Jose Dos Santos. The City of Cape Town says that the proposal is in line with its strategy to be the digital capital of Africa. “We are committed, as intended by the City’s Organisational Development and Transformation Plan, to not only provide world-class basic services but to also enable widespread connectivity, especially for previously disadvantaged communities,” said Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille.
