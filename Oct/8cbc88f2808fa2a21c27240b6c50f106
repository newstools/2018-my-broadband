Ruckus Networks has been named a preferred provider for VAST Networks in South Africa to roll out Hotspot 2.0 technology. This technology aims to simplify Wi-Fi roaming for customers by leveraging pre-loaded credentials and security certificates to automatically connect to Hotspot 2.0-compatible access points from participating wireless partners. “Most people do not even think twice when it comes to roaming on their mobile devices when they travel, but given the pressure of tighter budgets, roaming costs are a growing concern,” said Ruckus Networks sub-Saharan Africa sales director Riaan Graham. “Most wireless users prefer to connect to a hotspot whenever they can as a way of keeping those expenses to a minimum,” he said. “The challenge is finding and selecting the right network, logging on through a portal, and repeating the process every time a new hotspot is accessed.” Hotspot 2.0 infrastructure also allows non-interactive devices such as televisions and embedded media players to connect to Wi-Fi without human intervention. VAST Networks CTO Khetan Gajjar said that VAST’s ability to deploy Hotspot 2.0 in over 2,000 locations in a matter of weeks is indicative of its flexibility. “With Ruckus Networks, we’re able to continuously explore different methods of authenticating and onboarding users to our network with incremental effort.”
