Reed Exhibitions Africa said the inaugural Comic Con Africa was an “unprecedented success”, with over 45,000 fans attending. The event was hosted at the Kyalami International Convention Centre from 14-16 September 2018, and tickets sold out before the gates opened to the public. “Africa’s inaugural Comic Con has wrapped up and it exceeded even our wildest expectations,” Reed Exhibitions Africa MD Carol Weaving said. “The three-day gathering of gamers, cosplayers, pop culture fanatics, and comic book enthusiasts has ignited a magical fire on the African continent.” Comic Con Africa featured interactive sessions with international celebrities, large esports tournaments, panel discussions, and more. Weaving added that due to the big success, the event will return to Johannesburg next year. “Based on this success we are very proud and excited to announce that we will be bringing Comic Con Africa back to Johannesburg in 2019,” she said.
