Cell C announced that it has extended its ShoutOut social data bundles promotion until the end of January 2019. The bundles were first announced on 26 July 2018 and include access to Facebook and WhatsApp. “Customers have really seen the value in our ShoutOut bundles,” said Cell C Chief Commercial Officer Junaid Munshi. “With the holiday season coming up, we have decided to extend the promotion to ensure that customers are kept connected on the most popular social services at great value for money,” he said. The data bundles will be priced at the same rates as they were at launch, with three different promotions on offer. Users can purchase the bundles through the Cell C mobile app or USSD menu by dialling *147# and *109#.
