Tesla has produced 100,000 Model 3 vehicles, according to a report by Electrek. The electric carmaker is reportedly now manufacturing over 1,000 vehicles per day, and has maintained its average production rate into the fourth quarter of 2018. Tesla’s Model 3 is rapidly gaining popularity in the United States, becoming one of the best-selling sedans in America. Between July and September this year, Tesla delivered more Model 3s than all but four of the top sedans sold in the United States. This follows a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which required Elon Musk to step down as chairman of the company and pay a $20-million fine. Musk has retained his CEO position, however, and continues to be actively involved in the company’s operations.
