Jaguar has announced the local pricing for its upcoming electric I-Pace SUV. The vehicle will be available in four models – S, SE, HSE, and First Edition. First Edition models will only be available for one year after launch. All I-Pace models will ship with identical powertrains comprising a 90kWh battery and two synchronous electric motors delivering 294kW of power. The all-wheel-drive SUV can reach 0-100km/h in 4.8 seconds and has a range of up to 470km on a single charge. Below is the local pricing. The S model does not include the premium features found on the HSE and First Edition models, but still includes a 12.3-inch Interactive Driver Display, smartphone pack, and Luxtec sport seats. The First Edition model is based on the HSE model but also features alloy wheels with a Technical Grey finish, Matrix LED headlights, configurable ambient interior lighting, and metal treadplates with First Edition branding. Jaguar said that the I-Pace would launch in South Africa in early 2019, adding that it would announce pricing for the vehicle’s home charging stations closer to the launch date. Home charging cables compatible with normal wall sockets will also come as standard equipment for the vehicle.
