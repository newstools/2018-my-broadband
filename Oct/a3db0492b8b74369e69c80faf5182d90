Uncapped 100Mbps fibre – the dream of many Internet users. Download speeds of 100Mbps and no usage limits are almost necessary in the tech-heavy household, thanks to bandwidth intensive applications like video streaming, game and file downloads, and torrent usage. One of the biggest fibre network operators in South Africa is Openserve – the networks and infrastructure division of Telkom. Openserve states it has 147,000km of fibre laid in the country, which passes 2 million premises. The company offers fibre lines of up to 200Mbps, with upload speeds typically half of the download speed offered. While selecting a fibre package based on speed and price alone is a relatively simple task, looking at fair usage policies and potential shaping is more difficult. ISPs like Cool Ideas market themselves as offering completely uncapped and unshaped bandwidth, whereas other providers have set monthly limits. Making matters more complicated is that certain providers do not provide set monthly usage limits before traffic is slowed. The shaping of traffic during peak periods is also not disclosed by all providers, which means the user may not get a consistent experience. The table below shows the cheapest 100Mbps uncapped fibre deals on Openserve’s network in South Africa, not taking shaping or fair usage policies into account.
