Telkom is working towards addressing issues of poor service and will strive to give customers a great experience with the company. This is a statement from Serame Taukobong, CEO of small business and consumer at Telkom, who was speaking at the 2018 MyBroadband Conference. Taukobong said Telkom has become associated with bad service, and viewed in a negative light, and this needs to be fixed. If the issue is addressed, Telkom’s popular products like FreeMe and its deal of the month can become attractive to non-Telkom users. Taukobong also touched on difficulties customers have with cancelling Telkom services, and how this is a missed opportunity to upsell to users. Along with service improvements, Taukobong said Telkom was investing in its mobile network, particularly in the backhaul, to provide users with great speeds and a great experience. For users who do not use Telkom as their primary mobile provider, he punted the benefits of dual-SIM smartphones and how they let a user test Telkom as their secondary provider. If they like what they see, they can consider making Telkom their primary SIM, he said. Taukobong said Telkom was upping its game in other areas too, and is upgrading its Telkom LIT media player to Android 8.0 – making it Netflix compliant. The company is also rolling out its Telkom LIT app, he said.
