Leaked footage of Amazon’s upcoming New World massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) has surfaced online. A player with access to the game’s closed beta uploaded two hours of gameplay footage to PornHub, and a number of YouTube channels have already begun dissecting the new features revealed in the leaked video. New World is set in a supernatural version of Northern America in the 17th century, with players taking on the role of settlers attempting to build a civilisation in the untamed wilderness. The leaked footage showcases key features of New World, including hunting, gathering, combat and crafting, but does not include any in-depth information regarding the construction of buildings or how the game’s guild system will work. YouTuber Less Than Epic distilled the leaked video into nine minutes of key footage, analysing the new features revealed in the leak.
