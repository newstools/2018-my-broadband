Black Friday is taking place on 23 November 2018, and local ISPs will get involved in the sale day. Two of South Africa’s most prominent ISPs – Vox and Cybersmart – both told MyBroadband they will offer great specials on the day. The ISPs stated that more details about their specials will be announced closer to the day. This follows big retail players such as Takealot and Game announcing that they will hold big Black Friday sales this year. With all industries – from electronics retailers, to car dealerships, to broadband service providers taking part – Black Friday 2018 is set to be a busy day for shoppers. While no specifics of the ISP deals have been announced, Vox and Cybersmart both offer a range of broadband services to consumers and businesses. Vox offers fibre, ADSL, LTE, VoIP, Wi-Fi, hosting, PBX, and many more services. Cybersmart also offers ADSL, hosting, and fibre services, including its 500Mbps uncapped fibre for R899 deal. Users should therefore keep an eye out for a special in a category they are looking to secure a good deal in.
