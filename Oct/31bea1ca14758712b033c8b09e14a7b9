Bidorbuy announced that it is preparing for a record-breaking number of online shoppers on Black Friday 2018. “We believe that consumer interest will be at its highest this year”, said Bidorbuy CEO Jaco Jonker. “Black Friday started off as an international phenomenon, but over the past few years has become especially popular among South African shoppers,” he said. Jonker said that the online marketplace picks the best deals from its sellers to include in its Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, adding that sellers plan to offer the biggest possible discounts this year on their best products. “We are confident that our sellers’ efforts will pay off, because sales on Black Friday are traditionally exceptionally high, and this year we expect better results than ever.” Bidorbuy said shoppers can look forward to price cuts of up to 80% over a Black Friday shopping period from 19-26 November. The marketplace’s Cyber Monday deals will continue for a week after the Black Friday sales end.
