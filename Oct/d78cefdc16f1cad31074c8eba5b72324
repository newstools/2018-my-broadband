Stardew Valley developer Eric Barone revealed that his popular farming simulator will be ported to iPhone later this month. The mobile version of the game is set to release on the iOS App Store on 24 October 2018 and is being developed by London-based mobile development studio The Secret Police. This studio is also working on completing an Android port of Stardew Valley, although there is currently no release date for this version. Barone said the mobile version of Stardew Valley includes the full game and plays almost identically to the PC version, with the UI changing slightly to support touch screen gameplay. PC players can also transfer their saved games to the iOS version via iTunes. Stardew Valley is priced at $7.99 on the Apple App Store.
