Fortnite creator Epic Games has filed a lawsuit against YouTuber Brandon Lucas for using and selling cheats. Brandon Lucas, who goes by “Golden Modz”, posted videos of the cheats he used and sold the cheat tools through his website, according to Engadget. The lawsuit, which was brought against Lucas and his frequent partner Colton Conter, was filed because Lucas “violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, breached contract, and engaged in tortious interference” by posting such videos. Epic Games has asked YouTube to pull the videos off its site, despite Lucas’s claims of innocence where he said he didn’t view his behaviour as troublesome. Reportedly, Epic Games’ attorneys want Lucas to pay damages and court costs, as well as having his profits from selling the cheats disgorged. This is not the first lawsuit that Epic Games has filed against cheaters, and even though it is still working to improve its anti-cheating code in the game, the company seems to want to deter cheating by taking action against any known perpetrators.
