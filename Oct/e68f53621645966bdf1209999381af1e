Huawei and Bosch have announced a partnership to accelerate the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) in China. Under the agreement, which was announced at the Huawei Connect 2018 conference in Shanghai, Bosch will launch its IoT Suite of software services in China on Huawei Cloud. Bosch said that a leading Chinese automotive manufacturer has already chosen to deploy its IoT Suite on Huawei Cloud to update the firmware of its vehicles over the air. This is expected to be rolled out to millions of connected cars in China over the coming years. The Bosch IoT Suite includes a Vehicle Management Solution that connects vehicles throughout their service life. It provides the technological foundation for cloud-based services such as predictive diagnostics, and over-the-air software updates. “The software is the secure communication interface between the vehicle, the cloud, and the services. Data management enables vehicle manufacturers or fleet managers to organise vehicle data, analyse it, and keep the vehicle software continuously updated,” Bosch said. Following this announcement, Bosch and Huawei said that they intend to develop an integrated IoT offering. Huawei is developing IoT hardware gateways that will be pre-configured with software from Bosch, which will be managed through Bosch’s IoT Remote Manager. The Bosch IoT Remote Manager will be the first service made available to Chinese consumers via Huawei Cloud. It enables the managing and controlling of gateways, sensors, and devices. Additional services of the Bosch IoT Suite will follow in 2019. Bosch said that it expects China’s market for IoT platforms to grow by close to 70% in the coming years. “The demand for IoT solutions in China is rising. The partnership between Bosch and Huawei Cloud marks a decisive step for Bosch in one of the fastest growing IoT markets in Asia,” said Stefan Ferber, CEO of Bosch Software Innovations, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bosch.
