Samsung has launched its new Exynos Auto and Isocell Auto brands, which will manufacture processors and camera sensors for connected vehicles. The company said its Exynos Auto range will comprise three chip series – Exynos Auto V for infotainment systems, Exynos Auto A chips for advanced driving assistance, and Exynos Auto T for telematics solutions. Samsung’s Isocell Auto camera sensors allow for visibility in low-light environments, and enable precise identification of objects. “This allows, for example, vehicles to perceive road conditions or potential hazards even when driving through tunnels or other high-contrast environments,” Samsung said. Isocell Auto sensors are available in three models, with resolutions ranging from 960p to 4K. Samsung is demonstrating its Exynos Auto and Isocell Auto products at the International Suppliers Fair in Wolfburg, Germany, from 16-18 October 2018.
