SAFA is going to Parliament to request that it not be forced to share Bafana and Banyana soccers games (national men and women’s teams) with the SABC, as required by ICASA. This is according to a report in the Sunday Times. The report stated that as the two teams are “national interests”, their games must be broadcast for free on the SABC. SAFA wants to put an end to this, however, as it and the SABC have been fighting over TV rights. The SABC has offered to “only” pay R10 million for the soccer broadcast rights, while it reportedly pays R235 million for Confederation of African Football rights. SAFA said it wanted R200 million a year for the Bafana and Banyana rights, but was willing to renew its old agreement of R110 million per year. The report added that local national rugby and cricket rights were R670 million and R200 million respectively. It further stated that a fightback against the SABC from the PSL can now also be expected. The latest news on the showdown follows a report in August that the SABC was too broke to negotiate new Bafana and Banyana broadcast rights. The SABC reportedly owed SAFA over R50 million for its previous broadcast contract, which ended in April 2018. “In the last two discussions we have had with them‚ and this is with the top leadership of the SABC‚ the position was we do not have money and we want to be a responsible broadcaster and therefore we cannot spend money,” said SAFA.
