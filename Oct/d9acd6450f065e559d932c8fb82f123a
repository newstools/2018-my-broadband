Since the launch of Apple’s new iPhone Xs and Xs Max, many buyers have reported issues when attempting to charge their devices. YouTuber Unbox Therapy published a detailed investigation of the problem, recreating the issue across multiple iPhone Xs and Xs Max devices. This corroborates reports by users on Reddit and Apple’s forums who have experienced the same charging problems. Upon inserting the charger into the device’s port while the display is off, users reported that their device will not automatically begin charging. Instead, they need to tap on the device’s display to wake the device for the smartphone to begin charging. Additionally, certain devices which are experiencing this problem are unable to turn on their displays via the side button when a charger is plugged in. Apple has not yet issued a statement on the charging problems.
