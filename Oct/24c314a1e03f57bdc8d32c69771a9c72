ProtonDB has said users can play over 2,600 Windows games on Linux since the launch of the new Steam Play for Linux in August. Valve launched Steam Play with Proton, making it easier for gamers to play Window games on Linux that had not yet been ported to the operating system, including games such as The Witcher 3, Dark Souls 3, and Dishonored. Not all games may run perfectly on Linux, but the number of available games is growing daily. This, however, is often the case with Windows 10, as it cannot play older games as well as the previous versions of Windows could – even under Compatibility Mode. Since August, the database of games compatible with Proton has increased to over 2,600, which is more than half of the 5,000 Linux-native games that you can get through the Steam store.
