DStv Compact customers can now watch La Liga soccer – the Spanish league – as it has been added to the package. SuperSport 7 HD – the channel that is home to La Liga in South Africa – went live yesterday for Compact subscribers. “The DStv Compact customer has generally over the last few years evolved from being a local football purist into one that also shows appreciation for international football,” said Gideon Khobane, SuperSport’s chief executive. La Liga’s addition to the Compact package will further enhance the package for local soccer fans, boasting PSL football, Premier League, Italian Serie A, and continental football. “La Liga’s South African office has been doing some tremendous work in growing the league on the continent and we as their broadcast partners are always looking for ways and means to support their efforts,” Khobane said.
