According to Ars Technica, Tesla is being investigated by the FBI regarding the production of their Model 3 vehicles and their alleged misleading of investors. Previously, Tesla had received a voluntary request for documents from the FBI. Now, according to new reports, federal prosecutors have been delving deeper into the issue, including allegedly contacting former Tesla employees for testimony. Tesla spokesman Kamran Mumtaz has said that Tesla has not received a formal subpoena, request for testimony, or any other official process. He added that Tesla has a philosophy of setting truthful targets. Tesla has found itself in the midst of controversy in recent months after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private, and was considering doing so. However, Tesla has found itself on an upsurge after reporting its first quarterly profit in two years and that it is meeting vehicle production targets.
