MTN recently announced that it was cancelling its free 500MB-per-day Twitter service. “After providing free Twitter to millions of subscribers for an unprecedented four years, MTN’s industry-first free Twitter service will come to an end at midnight on 25 September,” said MTN. “Overall usage trends towards video and images have determined that it is no longer feasible to offer a service like Twitter for free due to the cost and demand it places on the network.” The move was disappointing to many MTN users, who used the free Twitter allocation to navigate and post on the social media service. There have even been suggestions that the cancellation of the service will kill “Black Twitter” in South Africa. Fortunately, local networks still offer Twitter data bundles which are available at much lower rates than normal mobile data. The bundles are available in different sizes and are valid for different lengths of time – both factors which affect the price of the bundles. The table below shows the best Twitter bundles available from local networks. It must be noted that Telkom does not offer Twitter-only data bundles on its website, while Cell C’s MediaPlay bundles only offer WhatsApp and Facebook usage.
