The manufacturer has worked to optimise a number of specific games and game engines, including Unity, Unreal, Messiah, and NeoX, and the new chipset supports various popular APIs. Qualcomm’s Spectra 200 series ISP also allows the Snapdragon 675 to capture high-quality images and slow-motion videos. The Snapdragon 675 supports triple-camera systems and features such as telephoto, wide angle, and super-wide angle sensors – in addition to 3D face unlock. Artificial intelligence performance has improved by up to 50% compared to the previous-generation chip, and the Snapdragon 675’s multi-core AI engine aims to improve general performance through intelligent optimisation, added the company. Qualcomm has also included an X12 modem with the Snapdragon 675, supporting download speeds of up to 600Mbps and 3x carrier aggregation. Support for Qualcomm Quick Charge 4+, Aqstic, and aptX has also been added to the chipset. The Snapdragon 675 is available to smartphone manufacturers today and is expected to be found in consumer devices in the first quarter of 2019.
