The Universal Services and Access Agency of South Africa (USAASA) said that it would continue to roll out DTT set-top boxes until they have been depleted. This follows an announcement from minister Nomvula Mokonyane that government would no longer be procuring set-top boxes and would move to an industry-driven model for the Broadcasting Digital Migration project. USAASA CEO Lumko Mtimde stated that under the new model, it and the South African Post Office (SAPO) would no longer be involved in the procurement and installation of set-top boxes. An allocation of R2.3 billion was received by USAASA for 1 million DTT set-top boxes, 500,000 DTH set-top boxes, 1 million antennas, and 500,000 satellite dishes. During the implement stage of the project, USAASA delivered 880,128 set-top boxes to SAPO, with 486,077 being installed to beneficiaries and the remainder stored in SAPO warehouses. Mtimde said that following the announcement, USAASA and SAPO would continue to install the remaining set-top boxes according to the old model until they run out, at which point there will be no new procurement order from USAASA. Bulk installations of set-top boxes are being rolled out in the Free State, Northern Cape, and North West.
