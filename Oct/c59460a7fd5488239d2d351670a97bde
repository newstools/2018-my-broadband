Outbreaks of cyberattacks such as Petya, NotPetya, WannaCry, and several other breaches over the past two years are a clear indication that cyberattacks are on the increase. In fact, the global cost of cybercrime is estimated to reach $2 trillion by 2019 – a fourfold increase from the 2015 estimate of $500 billion. Additionally, the South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC) stated that South Africa has the third highest number of cybercrime victims worldwide, losing about R2.2 billion a year to cyber-attacks. What’s more is that the rise of the Internet of Things ushers in an expanded cybersecurity threat landscape, increasing the vulnerability scope for a multitude or organisations. Every so often, printers and multifunction printers (MFPs) are overlooked as the device posing a security threat. As IoT devices, printers can be a predator’s open door into a network. The consequences of an attack on a business could be colossal. It may have legal implications with regards to GDPR an POPI standards, it could cause reputational damage, and it could have a severe impact on a business’s operations – as an attack could result in extended downtime only further leading to financial losses. Even if you understand the vulnerabilities, creating a complete imaging and printing security strategy can be complicated. For this reason, HP has designed a printing portfolio that offers comprehensive security and stops an attack the moment it starts. It can even self-heal with unique security features, helping enterprises of all sizes to stay a step ahead. Features in HP’s most secure printing portfolio are outlined below.
