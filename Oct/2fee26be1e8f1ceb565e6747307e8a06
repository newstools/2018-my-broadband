MyBroadband’s 2018 Black Friday survey shows that while most South Africans plan to take part in the shopping day, those who won’t are quite clear on why. Black Friday will take place on 23 November this year, and companies are gearing up for the big day – promising sales and specials for a range of products. These promises are not good enough for certain local shoppers, however. Of the 1,583 MyBroadband readers and forum members who took part in the survey – a tech-savvy and informed audience – 19% stated they will not shop on Black Friday 2018. Survey respondents who selected “no” to the question “Do you plan to shop on Black Friday 2018?” were then asked why they would not. Respondents were asked to select from a list of options, and multiple choices were allowed. The most popular reason given was “South African Black Friday deals are not good enough”, with 59% selecting this option. The result should not come as a big surprise, as many South Africans complain that discounts offered by local retailers – both during Black Friday and outside of this shopping period – are spurious. A tactic that readers say stores use is to have a “discounted” product price which is compared to the item’s “list” price. What this means is that, for example, a PC case has a list price of R1,000 – as published by a supplier or manufacturer. The price of the PC case in the open market, however, is R500. A retailer then sells the PC case as the “big discounted price” of R499, and claims to have taken 50% off in their advertising. The actual discount compared to the market price, though, is essentially zero, as the retailer has used the list price as the reference point. This has been reported to the ASA on several occasions, as shoppers feel they are being misled. The table below details the results for the 2018 Black Friday survey. Other reasons people are not shopping include not having disposable income, and saving money for the December holiday season.
