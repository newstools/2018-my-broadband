Echo Service Provider (Echo) announced it will merge the ISP operations of Gondwana International Networks (GIN), with the resulting entity operating in nine African markets. GIN is the majority shareholder in operations across seven countries, including Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, and Ghana. Echo said it operates as South Africa’s only truly independent ISP, hosting its core infrastructure in Teraco data centres to provide clients with vendor-neutral services. “This transaction has taken almost a year to conclude,” says Echo director Angus MacRobert. “We are really excited about the opportunities this deal creates in adding value to Echo’s existing client base while growing our business through exposure to exciting domestic markets in Africa.” GIN CEO Mathew Welthagen said the merger with Echo is a natural fit for the company. “The timing is also aligned with GIN’s expansion phase of the business,” he said.
