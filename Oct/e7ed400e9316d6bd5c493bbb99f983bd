RED director Phil Holland has published an infographic detailing the specifications of the company’s upcoming Hydrogen One smartphone. The graphic shows many of the smartphone’s basic specifications, revealing that it will have a 5.7-inch holographic LCD display, a 4,500mAh battery, and dual 12.3MP rear cameras. Other interesting features include dual-SIM capabilities, a dedicated camera shutter button, side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and a 3.5mm audio jack. “There is a great deal of new and/or exclusive technology found within the Hydrogen One smartphone, which is notable in the mobile landscape of 2018,” Holland said. “The design is rugged and ‘meant to be held’ rather than a smooth piece of glass destined for slippage.” “With an eye towards the very near future, especially for content creators, Modular Expansion is going to truly set this device apart from anything else out there,” he added. Holland announced that pre-orders of the device would begin shipping this week.
