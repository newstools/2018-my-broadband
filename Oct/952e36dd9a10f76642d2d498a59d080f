The AA has stated that South Africa will be hit by another petrol price increase next month. “International oil prices remain stubbornly high and it is possible that current tensions involving Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s biggest oil producers, could place more pressure on fuel prices,” said the AA. This is expected to translate into: The latest news follows the price of 95 petrol breaking the R17-per-litre mark in Gauteng on 3 October. As a result, the government may set a maximum price for unleaded fuel to protect customers against severe price increases.
