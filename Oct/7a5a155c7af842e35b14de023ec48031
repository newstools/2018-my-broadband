MyBroadband’s Q3 2018 speed test and ISP rating results show that Cybersmart is the top-rated fibre and ADSL service provider in South Africa. The ISP rankings are based on thousands of consumer ratings on MyBroadband’s speed test platform. Over the last three months, 676,220 speed tests were performed on the platform. MyBroadband’s HTML5 speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure a neutral testing environment. Many of the users who perform speed tests also rate the service they receive from their ISP on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. According to the Q3 2018 statistics, the average download speed in South Africa was 15.35Mbps, and the average upload speed was 11.09Mbps. The average ISP consumer rating during the quarter was 2.77 stars. Cybersmart opened a big lead over its competitors in the latest South African ISP ratings. This improvement followed big price cuts by Cybersmart on its uncapped fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) products, which offer by far the best value-for-money in the country. The company has also increased the speed of its FTTH products from 400Mbps to 500Mbps for no additional cost, which will further its advantage in Q4. The table below provides an overview of the ratings of South Africa’s top ISPs, along with the average speeds recorded by their subscribers. The results show that ISPs with mainly fibre subscribers, like Cybersmart, Cool Ideas, Vox, and Bitco, have a big advantage in both speed and customer satisfaction over the others with large numbers of DSL subscribers.
