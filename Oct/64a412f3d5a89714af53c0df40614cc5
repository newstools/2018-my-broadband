Apple’s iCloud service appears to have experienced extended outages as many users reported issues accessing some iCloud-based apps, The Verge reported. Apple noted that iCloud was experiencing some sort of widespread service disruption, which was evidenced on its System Status page. Key Apple software services, including iCloud Backup, iCloud Drive, and a number of productivity apps that sync using Apple’s cloud platform, appeared to be affected by the outage. iCloud Keychain, which is used for secure login and general account sign in for iOS devices and Macs, was also affected, among a few other serious software tools that rely on the iCloud infrastructure. Apple has not issued any official statements on the matter; however, they do not operate any other official channels for updating users on service status beyond the status page. The system status page does now indicate that the services affected by the outage have had their issues resolved.
