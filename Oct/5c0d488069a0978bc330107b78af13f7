Facebook has revealed its new Portal and Portal+ smart speakers, with Alexa built-in. Both speakers feature large displays and cameras to facilitate video calling and other communication functionality. Facebook states that its Portal speakers are designed with privacy in mind, and the products ship with a physical camera cover for users who do not fully trust the option to disable the hardware. The cameras and microphones on Facebook’s Portal smart home devices automatically track the subject as they move around and minimise background noise when applicable. Portal is also linked with Facebook, and is able to provide birthday reminders, notify you when close friends are available to connect, and display your photos and videos. Both devices include 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2, and are available for pre-order from Facebook’s Portal website.
