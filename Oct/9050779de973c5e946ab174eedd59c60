Telkom announced it is implementing the suspended ICASA End-User Subscriber Service Charter, introducing revised usage depleted notifications and changing default out-of-bundle billing. Telkom executive for mobile products Andrew Dawson said this is Telkom’s first phase of the implementation of the charter. “Telkom Mobile subscribers will now receive an SMS indicating the actual amount of voice, SMS, or data bundle balances remaining at the relevant thresholds,” said Dawson. “The revised SMS notifications will apply to all current and legacy voice and data contracts, as well as to ad-hoc voice, SMS, and data bundles which customers may have purchased.” Telkom will also change out-of-bundle billing for its FreeMe plans, with users now being redirected to an out-of-bundle page once their data has been depleted. “This means that no Telkom mobile customer will automatically go out-of-bundle on any mobile plan in future – thus reducing any bill shock for our customers,” Telkom said. The mobile operator said these changes will take effect from 20 October 2018. Telkom added that its next phase of changes are expected to be implemented by the end of 2018 and will cover the remaining requirements of the EUSSC.
