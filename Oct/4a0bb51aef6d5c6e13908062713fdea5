The Film and Publication Board (FPB) is floundering due to mismanagement and a lack of compliance, according to a report in the City Press. The FPB is responsible for the classification of films and video games prior to their release in South Africa. According to two reports obtained by the City Press, the board is opening itself up to serious risks due to irregularities within its governance and HR units. An internal audit of the board’s governance unit said there is “huge risk” within the unit, exposing a major problem regarding a lack of skills and capacity. The report added that a lack of standard operating procedures is an endemic problem within the FPB. FPB communications head Lynette Kamineth denied the allegations presented by the reports, adding that the recent collapse of the board’s management structure was no longer a problem. “With the exception of the chief executive position, which is about to be filled, the executive committee is now fully constituted with qualified and experienced employees,” Kamineth said. Earlier this year, the FPB classified the award-winning South African film Inxeba (The Wound) as X18, the same rating given to hardcore pornography films. This restricted the film to be distributed only from designated adult premises, greatly reducing its availability to the public. The move was seen as politically-influenced, calling into question the independence of the FPB.
