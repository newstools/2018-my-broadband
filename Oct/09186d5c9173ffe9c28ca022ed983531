Fascinated by the latest trends in the world of electronics and technology? Meet directly with technology traders at the International Consumer Electronic Expo • South Africa (ICEE•SA) in Johannesburg this November. Mark 7 to 9 November 2018 in your diary to connect with more than 120 international electronics manufacturers and suppliers at the event, taking place at the Sandton Convention Centre. ICEE•SA aims to put local buyers and consumers in touch with technology developers and marketers from China. Similar expos were also recently hosted in Brazil and Indonesia. A large delegation of the exhibitors will be coming from the south-eastern Chinese city of Shenzhen across the border from Hong Kong’s New Territories, a fast-growing metropolis that is home to many global corporations and technology companies. No goods will physically exchange hands at the expo, but the latest cutting-edge technologies will be on display, offering the perfect opportunity to grow and strengthen your industry networks. There will be translators and facilitators available to ensure smooth negotiations and discussions between exhibitors and visitors. The expo will focus on six categories of tech: personal electronics; audio and video products; smart technology; IT and wireless services; electronic components and materials; and unmanned electronic vehicle products and technologies. There will also be daily seminars on the sidelines of the exhibition, addressing trade and logistics procedures between South Africa and China. Entrance to the expo is free, but participants can pre-register on the ICEE South Africa 2018 website.
