Discovery has confirmed that a small group of users has been affected by a defect in its online booking platform. The company made the statement in response to questions from MyBroadband about the incident. A Discovery Vitality member contacted MyBroadband after she experienced the issue when trying to book a flight, and claim her Discovery Vitality discount, on a local airline website. She said when she logged into her Discovery account to make the booking, she was directed to a page which contained the details of another user – including their personal details. The Vitality member contacted the airline, which advised her to contact Discovery. Discovery then reportedly told her it was aware of the issue and would address it. “We can confirm that there was an issue with our travel booking platform that affected a very limited number of members. We have assisted three members who contacted us in this regard,” Discovery told MyBroadband. “This unfortunately resulted from a change in the booking platform, which was designed to enhance the security of the booking process. The defect meant that, under extremely rare circumstances, a member logging in had sight of another member’s basic biographical details, contact details and Discovery Miles balance.” The company said that the information exposed did not include ID numbers, nor “information that would result in financial loss”. “We take data privacy very seriously and are vigilant about protecting our members’ privacy. We have taken steps to ensure the systems error has been fully resolved, and although there should not be any additional impact, any members with concerns or similar issues, are encouraged to contact us at vitalityinfo@discovery.co.za.”
