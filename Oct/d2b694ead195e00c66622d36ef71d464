Cape Town’s average speed over distance (ASOD) camera systems are a big success, with a significant reduction in transgressions where they have been installed. Cape Town introduced its first ASOD camera system in 2012, and installed it on three other roads since. The city currently has ASOD systems installed on the roads listed below: Cape Town’s mayoral committee member for safety and security Alderman JP Smith told MyBroadband that the systems are effective to reduce transgressions. “Based on the statistics for the four stretches of road where the system is installed, we are of the view that it has reduced the number of motorists who speed,” Smith said. Between July 2016 and June 2017, 110,442 speeding transgressions were recorded across the four installations. By comparison, 67,653 transgressions were recorded for the corresponding period in 2017/18. However, he said they cannot speak on behalf of the Western Cape Government or the South African National Roads Agency, who are the custodians of the major highways like the N1, N2, and R300. Smith told MyBroadband that the City of Cape Town has no plans for further ASOD installations. The city is, however, working with the Cape Town Traffic Service together with the city’s service provider to identify roads where the most serious crashes occur. It plans to strategically place plinths supporting camera housings, and rotate a few cameras between these locations. This will help the city and traffic service to better address the number of serious crashes on its roads. The graphic below shows how an ASOD camera system works.
