Microsoft Office users on Mac will receive an update to macOS Mojave which will bring a dark mode. The dark mode went live for Insider Fast testers, according to Office product manager Akshay Bakshi. Other users may have to wait a while before this update will roll out to them, however. Microsoft has already added a dark mode to File Explorer in its Windows 10 October 2018 update, and this update to Microsoft Office on Mac mirrors Mojave’s native dark mode. Following its normal trend, Microsoft will make the dark mode available to Office 365 subscribers first, before releasing the Office feature to the standalone Office apps.
