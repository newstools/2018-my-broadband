MyBroadband’s Q3 2018 broadband speed test results show that Johannesburg is the South African city with the highest average broadband speed. The research further reveals that Gauteng enjoys the best broadband speeds, while the Northern Cape has the worst performance. MyBroadband’s Q3 2018 speed test report is based on 676,220 speed tests performed on MyBroadband’s speed test platform between 1 July and 30 September 2018. MyBroadband’s speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure a neutral testing environment. The speed tests include fixed-line, wireless, and mobile connections from ISPs, which means the results are representative of multiple technologies. According to the Q3 2018 statistics, the average download speed in South Africa was 15.35Mbps, while the average upload speed was 11.09Mbps. MyBroadband’s Q3 2018 speed test report shows that Johannesburg is the top large city, followed by Cape Town, Pretoria, then Durban. The report reveals that Gauteng and the Western Cape have big advantages over other provinces in South Africa.
