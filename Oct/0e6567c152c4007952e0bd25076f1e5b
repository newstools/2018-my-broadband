GitHub was hit with downtime in the early hours of Monday morning after a data storage system failed, The Register reported. The site was back online quickly, but users still reported experiencing problems while trying to use the site. Developers said they were experiencing problems pushing code to the online version control system, and were occasionally receiving out-of-date files when accessing repositories. Users also reported that Gist – the text snippet sharing tool in GitHub – is ignoring submissions. Bug reports are not being updated, and new discussion posts are not being displayed. At 10:19 — nearly eight hours after the data storage system failure first occurred, GitHub posted an update about the incident to its blog. “At 10:52 pm Sunday UTC, multiple services on GitHub.com were affected by a network partition and subsequent database failure resulting in inconsistent information being presented on our website. Out of an abundance of caution we have taken steps to ensure the integrity of your data, including pausing webhook events and other internal processing systems,” GitHub said. The company said it could not yet provide an estimated time frame for full recovery. “We will share this information with you as soon as it is available,” it said. “During this time, information displayed on GitHub.com is likely to appear out of date; however, no data was lost. Once service is fully restored, everything should appear as expected. Further, this incident only impacted website metadata stored in our MySQL databases, such as issues and pull requests. Git repository data remains unaffected and has been available throughout the incident.”
