Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida has stated that the company is looking at what’s next for the PlayStation console. According to The Verge, Yoshida said “it’s necessary to have a next-generation hardware” in a recent interview. Yoshida did not call the next-generation console a PlayStation 5, but it is predicted this is the path the upgrade will follow, after the launch of the PlayStation 4 Pro. The PlayStation 4 Pro was launched in November 2016, while the PlayStation 4 was launched in November 2013. This means that November 2018 will mark five years since the PlayStation 4 launched.
