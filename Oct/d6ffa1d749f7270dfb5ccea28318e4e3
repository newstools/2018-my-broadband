Eskom has warned that there is a high risk of load shedding because of severe power constraints caused by maintenance and unplanned outages at many of its electricity-generating units. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe highlighted that “load shedding has not been declared yet by the national control”. “We’re doing everything possible to avoid it, but it is there in terms of the risk which is what we’re currently dealing with,” he said. At around 19:30 on Monday evening Phasiwe said the risk of load shedding has been reduced, thanks to some of the units which were offline coming back online. While there is still some risk of load shedding, Phasiwe said it has been minimized.
