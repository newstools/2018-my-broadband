Cybersmart and BitCo recently unveiled new fibre packages for the local market. Cybersmart now offers a 500Mbps Lightspeed uncapped fibre service for R899 per month, while BitCo launched uncapped fibre packages on Vumatel’s fibre network. The new products follow the recent launch of Supersonic, MTN’s rebrand of Smart Village, which offers fibre ISP services and runs a fibre network. Even more recent is the launch of GigaGo, MetroFibre Networx’s fibre ISP which offers uncapped packages. While Cybersmart’s Lightspeed fibre packages are only available on its fibre network, Supersonic packages are available on Supersonic’s fibre network, Openserve, and Vumatel. BitCo’s home fibre packages are initially available on Vumatel’s network, while GigaGo’s packages are initially available on MetroFibre Networx and Openserve fibre networks. To see how these packages stack up, we compared their pricing and speed. It must be noted that Cybersmart’s Lightspeed 500Mbps package features adjustable download and upload rates – letting users set their line as 400Mbps/100Mbps or 250Mbps/250Mbps, for example, on the fly. The table below shows the packages and pricing available from these providers. Please note that fair usage limits and activation fees for the packages have not been taken into account.
