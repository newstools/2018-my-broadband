The majority of South Africans are planning to spend less than R5,000 this Black Friday. This is according to the 2018 MyBroadband Black Friday survey. The survey was completed by 1,583 MyBroadband readers and forum members, who are tech-savvy and informed South Africans. Of the readers who responded to the survey, 81% said they planned to shop on Black Friday this year – which takes place on 23 November. As part of the survey, the respondents who indicated they plan to shop on Black Friday were asked how much they plan to spend, which items they plan on buying, and what they would consider a good deal. For the spend question, they were asked to select from a list of set values – with only a single choice allowed. The results of this question are detailed in the table below, which reveal that the large majority of shoppers plan to spend under R5,000. Respondents were then asked what they plan to buy on Black Friday, and were offered a variety of categories to choose from. PC hardware and gaming consoles was by far the most popular category among respondents. Users were allowed to make multiple selections, and the results of the question are shown below. Respondents were then asked what they would consider a good Black Friday deal in terms of a percentage discount. The percentage discount is in relation to real retail prices, and not “list prices” – often used by retailers to inflate their discount offerings during sales. The table below details the results of the survey, with many users wanting to see 40-60% off retail prices.
