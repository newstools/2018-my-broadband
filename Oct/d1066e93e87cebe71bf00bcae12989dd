The Mail and Guardian has reported it will cost R1 billion to fix problems with Sars’ IT systems. The report added that R200 million previously paid to Gartner to overhaul Sars’ IT systems was “not worth” the money spent. Gartner received the money to develop a new IT strategy for Sars in 2015. Andre Rabie, Sars acting group executive for IT, has now said it will cost R1 billion to repair the organisation’s IT systems. Rabie stated that he was also not consulted properly by Garner during their work with Sars. This resulted in the IT issues Sars sits with at the moment, which includes a possible crash of the e-filing system in the coming years. Besides the large repair bill, Sars also needs to bring back “people with expertise” to work in the organisation, said Rabie. Sars will also need a systems improvement if it is to execute its plan to identify local cryptocurrency traders. This was needed so anyone dodging taxes could be tracked, said Sars in August.
