The Patent and Market Court in Sweden has ordered Telia, the country’s dominant telecommunications operator, to block access to The Pirate Bay, Dreamfilm, FMovies, and NyaFilmer. TorrentFreak reported that the interim order comes into effect at the end of October, which was as a result of a complaint from Hollywood and Swedish film studios. A coalition comprised of the Swedish Film Industry, Nordisk Film, Disney, Paramount, Columbia, and Twentieth Century Fox approached the court and obtained the interim order. This is not the first site-blocking case brought to the Swedish courts. Last year, rights-holders won an appeal to a case which began in 2014 that saw Bredbandsbolaget (Broadband Company) being ordered to block its subscribers from accessing The Pirate Bay and streaming portal Swefilmer. Bredbandsbolaget, which focuses on offering high-speed fibre broadband connections, was the second-largest Internet service provider in Sweden. It merged with parent Telenor Sverige in May of this year. While other ISPs were free to continue to provide access to The Pirate Bay, a coalition of content companies has now sought and obtained a court order against Sweden’s largest network operator, Telia Company. Telia is the formerly state-owned monopoly telco in Sweden. It remains the dominant telecommunications operator, and the biggest mobile network operator in the country. As of 30 September 2018, the Swedish government owns 37.3% of the company.
