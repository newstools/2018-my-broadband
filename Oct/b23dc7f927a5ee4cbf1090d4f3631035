Twitter has updated its mobile app for Android and iOS, adding a new Data Saver feature, TechCrunch reports. The company previously launched a Twitter Lite application for emerging markets, and now lets users of its primary app limit mobile data usage. Twitterâ€™s Data Saver option has been available in the Twitter for Windows application and its mobile website for some time. Data Saver can be accessed from within the Data Usage settings menu in the mobile app, and users can choose to toggle the option on or off. When enabled, Data Saver reduces the quality of images and disables autoplaying videos in the Twitter app, allowing users to load high-quality images manually for each piece of content on their timeline.
