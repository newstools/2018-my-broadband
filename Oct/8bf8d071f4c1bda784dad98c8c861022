Apple has taken down the watch OS 5.1 update following reports that it was causing Apple Watches to become unusable, The Verge reported. Several Apple Watch owners have taken to social media to report that their device gets stuck on displaying the Apple logo. Restarting the watch and its paired iPhone does not appear to fix the problem. According to the report, the issue seems to only affect the latest version of the device, the Apple Watch Series 4. Although Apple has pulled the update, 9to5Mac reported that the company has not acknowledged the issue otherwise. MacRumors reports that readers are saying Apple will ship replacement watches for customers who have been affected.
