Facebook has confirmed to TechCrunch that it is developing an augmented reality headset. Speaking at the TechCrunch AR/VR event in Los Angeles, Facebook head of augmented reality Ficus Kirkpatrick said that the company is building AR hardware products, although it does not currently have any products to announce. “We are building hardware products,” Kirkpatrick said. “We want to see those glasses come into reality, and I think we want to play our part in helping to bring them there.” “We have no product to announce right now. But we have a lot of very talented people doing really, really compelling cutting-edge research that we hope plays a part in the future of headsets.” This follows an annonucement earlier this month, where Facebook unveiled its new Portal smart speakers with Alexa built in. These devices feature large displays and cameras for video calling and communication, and include integration with a number of smart home devices.
