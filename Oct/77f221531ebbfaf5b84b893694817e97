Sony has announced that it will soon start testing the “long-awaited feature” that will allow users to change their PlayStation Network Online ID on their PlayStation 4. “The PSN Online ID Change feature beta will be a part of the PlayStation Preview Program, and will become available to select users that have pre-registered as testers for previous PS4 system software betas,” said Sony. During the preview program, users will be able to change their online ID multiple times. “The first change is free, and changes after that will cost $9.99. For PlayStation Plus members, it will cost $4.99.” Changes to an online ID can be made through the Settings menu or via the Profile page of a PS4. “This feature is compatible with PS4 games originally published after April 1, 2018, and a large majority of the most-played PS4 games that were released before this date.”
