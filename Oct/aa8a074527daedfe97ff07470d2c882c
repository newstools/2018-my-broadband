Makro has identified and fixed an issue with its online shopping platform which led to delivery and order cancellation problems, the company told MyBroadband. Makro was responding to questions from MyBroadband, following complaints from readers about its online shopping platform. Users stated that there were two main issues with their shopping experiences of late: Makro said it would firstly like to apologise to customers for the inconvenience they experienced because of delays in deliveries. “Makro takes pride in ensuring our customers’ satisfaction and have addressed the root cause of the problem,” said Makro. The company said its online shopping process is as follows: “Upon thorough review of the situation, we narrowed the cause to a system glitch, which resulted in orders being allocated to stores that were not the best-suited from a stock perspective and contributed to the delay.” On the matter of incorrect pricing on the Makro Marketplace platform, the company said a seller uploaded an incorrect pricing file last week which “resulted in their products being listed at an average price of 83% lower than the normal market price”. “This inadvertent error was quickly detected and the price rectified, but several orders had been processed at the incorrect selling price. All affected customers have received a R100 gift card as a gesture of goodwill and will be refunded immediately,” said Makro. Makro added that it is committed to providing customers with the highest level of customer service and continues to work to improve its customer experience.
