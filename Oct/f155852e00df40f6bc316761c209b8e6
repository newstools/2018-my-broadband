Waze has expanded its Carpool app to every state in the US, Engadget reports. The companyâ€™s Carpool app allows riders and drivers to match with others based on their profile, star rating, and various other filters. Waze previously rolled out its application in Israel and selected US states, and is now expanding its support in an effort to grow its community. As more drivers and riders sign on to the app, matchmaking between them based on their proximity to common routes is increased. The company also announced that it would partner with Amazon to allow employees to carpool to 50 Amazon Fulfillment Centres. For a limited time, new users in the United States will receive $20 credit within Carpool for referring others to use the app.
