Netflix is massive – in fact, Sandvine has reported that it accounts for 15% of worldwide downstream traffic. This makes it the number one downstream application worldwide. While the figure is impressive, the report further noted that Netflix is among the best at optimising content so that it uses as little data as possible to deliver high-quality video. Netflix states that for users to enjoy a Full HD show on its platform, users need a 5Mbps Internet connection. For users who have UHD displays, a UHD Netflix stream requires a 25Mbps connection. This means that even DSL users can enjoy the best quality Netflix has to offer, thanks to DSL lines supporting up to 40Mbps in South Africa. What you really want for Netflix viewing, however, is uncapped fibre. Uncapped fibre is the perfect companion for Netflix, as it offers users fast speeds and all the data they need to watch their favourite shows and movies. And with Netflix’s optimised content, you don’t need a 100Mbps line to enjoy all the resolution options on offer – as detailed above. To help users select which ISP may serve them best, Netflix publishes a monthly speed index detailing the prime-time Netflix performance of particular providers. It must be noted that this is not a measure of overall performance of the networks, and only reflects the average bitrate of Netflix content, in Mbps, streamed by its members per ISP. The table below details the 5Mbps-to-25Mbps uncapped fibre packages available on Openserve and Vumatel from these ISPs, along with their pricing. The ISPs are ranked from first onwards, based on the Netflix speed index. It must be noted that fair usage and shaping policies of the ISPs are not taken into account.
