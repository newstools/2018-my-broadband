Sony announced that it is developing a new digital rights management (DRM) system for digital content which will be built on blockchain technology. This new system will support the same features delivered by the company’s previous DRM platforms, but will include functionality for processing rights-related information. “Today, advances in technologies for digital content creation allow anyone to broadcast and share content, but the rights management of that content is still carried out conventionally by industry organisations or the creators themselves, necessitating a more efficient way of managing and demonstrating ownership of copyright-related information for written works,” Sony said. The company’s blockchain-based DRM system will be able to demonstrate the date and time electronic data was created, using blockchain technology to record verifiable information which is difficult to falsify. “In addition to the creation of electronic data, booting up this system will automatically verify the rights generation of a piece of written works, which has conventionally proven difficult,” Sony stated. Sony’s new blockchain DRM system could potentially be applied to digital content including music, films, ebooks, VR content, and more.
