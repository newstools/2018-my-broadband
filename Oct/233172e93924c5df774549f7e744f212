Google Chrome 70 is set to release in the coming weeks, and may result in many “secure” websites being blocked by the browser. TechCrunch reported that Chrome will show security error messages for sites which run Symantec certificates issued before June 2016. This includes legacy Thawte, VeriSign, Equifax, GeoTrust, and RapidSSL certificates. The reason for the shift is that Google and other companies said Symantec issued misleading and wrong certificates. Despite being given a year’s notice to prepare for the change, the report stated that over 1,000 sites in the top one million Alexa-ranked sites are not prepared. This included big companies like Ferrari – which subsequently updated its certificates. TechCrunch said Chrome 70 is set to roll out on 16 October 2018.
