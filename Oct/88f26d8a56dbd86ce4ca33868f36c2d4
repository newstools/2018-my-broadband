Vodacom’s business unit has launched its new Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) offering in South Africa, making Vodacom one of the first telecom companies to launch this technology in the country. SD-WAN applies software-defined networking to WAN connections which connect enterprise networks, aiming to improve the efficiency of operations. “Broadband access and flexible networking will be the communication foundation required to drive the new digital world,” said Vodacom Business managing executive Fatima Hassim. “New technologies like Service Defined Networks and flexible broadband Internet access will be at the heart of the enterprise IT foundation.” Vodacom said it has already rolled out SD-WAN to two commercial customers, and the company expects adoption of the technology to grow rapidly. Enterprises which are now enabled with SD-WAN technology can opt to use Internet-only traffic, saving on the costs of using alternative technologies. “[SD-WAN] provides a wide range of important operational and financial benefits, ranging from agility, quality of service, security, reliability and performance.”
