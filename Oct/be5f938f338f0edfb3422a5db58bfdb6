Michael Novogratz, one of the most prominent investors in digital currencies, reiterated that he doesn’t expect big moves in the price of Bitcoin until institutional investors jump in, perhaps in the first half of next year. “One thing you learn in this process is that everything takes a little longer than you hoped it would,” Novogratz said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “I don’t don’t see us breaking $10,000 by the end of the year.” Novogratz’s Galaxy Investment Partners will be one of the first customers of a digital asset unit announced Monday by Fidelity Investments during a conference sponsored by the two companies and Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News. A sudden exodus from the most popular dollar-linked cryptocurrency rippled through digital asset markets on Monday, saddling some investors with losses while propelling Bitcoin to its biggest gain in more than three weeks. Tether, the so-called stablecoin used as a substitute for the U.S. currency on crypto exchanges around the world, broke its historically tight link with the greenback, touching 85 cents on U.S.-based venue Kraken. Transactions on Binance, one of the world’s most active platforms for Tether, recently implied a price of about 96 cents, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Bitcoin jumped as much as 8.9 percent to $6,769 as Tether holders shifted into alternative virtual currencies.
