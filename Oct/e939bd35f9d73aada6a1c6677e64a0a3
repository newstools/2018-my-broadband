Dell has unveiled its latest Alienware laptop, with the focus of the machine on its powerful hardware encased in a thin and light chassis. Alienware is known for its high-end gaming PCs, but lightweight and thin are not terms usually associated with the brand. The new laptop – Alienware m15 – is the company’s thinnest and lightest laptop ever made, and features a magnesium alloy frame which uses Nvidia’s Max-Q design. It measures 2.1cm thick and weighs 2.15kg, said Dell. Specifications include a 15-inch display – available in FHD 60Hz, FHD 144Hz, or UHD 60Hz – Intel 8th-gen processors, up to 32GB of RAM, and Nvidia GTX 1060 or GTX 1070 GPUs. The m15 goes on sale on 25 October in the US, starting at $1,099.   <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
