Civilization VI is now available for iPhones on the Apple App Store. The game was previously available for download on iPad. Civilization VI for iOS features the full experience of the PC version of the game, except for the online multiplayer component. The iPhone port does support two local multiplayer modes however, with both the hot seat and local modes ported from the PC version. Hot seat allows multiple users to play on the same device, while the local multiplayer mode allows users connected to the same Wi-Fi network to play together. Civilization VI is also set to launch on the Nintendo Switch on 16 November 2018.
