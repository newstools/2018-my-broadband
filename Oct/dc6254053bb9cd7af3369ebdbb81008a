Taxify has expanded its operations in South Africa by launching local services in Polokwane and East London. This follows a recent investment round of $175 million in the ride-hailing company. Taxify began operations in Johannesburg in 2016 and now operates in eight South African cities, including Tshwane, Ekurhuleni, Cape Town, Durban, and Port Elizabeth. The company said its ride-hailing platform began offering services in Polokwane today, with operations in East London set to commence later this month. Taxify now operates in more cities across South Africa than in any other countries where it has a presence, and employs over 80 permanent staff in South Africa. “Taxify is committed to the South African market, and we intend to grow our footprint to more towns and cities across the country, making it possible for more people to benefit from ride-hailing services, whether they are riders seeking cost-effective convenience, or drivers seeking business opportunities,” said Taxify SA country manager Gareth Taylor.
