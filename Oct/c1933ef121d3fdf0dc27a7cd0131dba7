TorrentFreak has released its list of the most downloaded movies through BitTorrent over the past week. TorrentFreak uses its estimates of the number of times a movie was downloaded for its weekly chart. Ant-Man and the Wasp held onto first place on the charts, while Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation held its spot for the third week in a row. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again entered the charts in second place. “The data for our weekly download chart is for informational and educational reference only,” said TorrentFreak.
