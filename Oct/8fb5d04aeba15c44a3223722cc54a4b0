Microsoft and Google have both unveiled new tablets in recent weeks, with Google’s Pixel Slate the newest arrival. The tablet is called the future of Chrome OS by Google and features a thin and lightweight design. It packs a high-resolution 12.3-inch screen, 8MP camera, and front-facing speakers for crisp sound. It is powered by Intel Celeron and Core processors, with varying amounts of RAM and storage available. Microsoft’s Surface Pro 6 device is designed in a similar way and can function in “tablet, studio, or laptop” modes, packs an 8th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, and up to 16GB of RAM. It runs Windows 10 and also features Intel UHD graphics – all for a starting price of $899. Both devices are sold as high-end, powerful tablets that can function as laptops thanks to keyboard attachments. Arguably the biggest difference, though, is the operating systems – Chrome OS versus Windows 10, and what each offers users. It must also be noted that Microsoft will not officially sell the Surface Pro 6 in South Africa, while the Google Store does not list its hardware as available in South Africa. The table below compares the specifications of the tablet PCs.
