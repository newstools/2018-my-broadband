If you have any plans to buy a new TV, PlayStation, laptop, monitor, graphics card, or giant inflatable swan, stop them now. The only thing worse than buying a new TV in September and seeing it for cheaper in October is buying a new TV in October and seeing it for cheaper on Black Friday. Black Friday 2018 will take place on 23 November, and is – now – an international day of massive discounts on items from physical stores and online retailers. Big players like Takealot, Makro, Checkers, Telkom, and Game all hold Black Friday specials, offering savings on a wide array of products. In 2017, everything from smartphones, TVs, and SSDs to flights and clothing were on special in South Africa. In the US, companies such as Amazon hold truly-impressive sales on the day, with discounts that will not be seen at any other point in the year. South Africans can take advantage of deals in the US via direct imports or third-party shipping companies. What this means for consumers is that while there may be good specials over the next month on products or services you want, be strong and hold onto your cash. Whatever specials are available in October and early November, they are almost guaranteed to be bested by Black Friday specials. Black Friday deals normally start the week of Black Friday, which is 19 November this year. In 2017, Amazon took this one step further by opening its Black Friday store on 1 November. If you are unable to take advantage of Black Friday deals, the Monday after the shopping day will give consumers a second chance to buy what they want online. The Monday following Black Friday is Cyber Monday – on 26 November this year. Cyber Monday sees online retailers offering specials on products, with the aim of encouraging more people to buy products and services using ecommerce sites. In summary, if you are planning to buy a new TV, laptop, SSD, or any tech item, resist the urge and hold on until that sweet Black Friday deal comes into your cross hairs.
