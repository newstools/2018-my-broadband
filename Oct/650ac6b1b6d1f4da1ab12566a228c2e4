Openserve is focused on fibre and the future of connectivity. This is according to Althon Beukes, Chief Commercial Officer at Openserve, who was speaking at the 2018 MyBroadband Conference. Beukes said that with the 4th industrial revolution underway, the ability to connect via the Internet and exchange data becomes more critical. Connecting people to people, people to things, and things to things – all with super high-speed connectivity – is a priority. At the same time, Openserve must ensure it offers a connectivity value proposition that makes sense. With technology and connectivity expanding across industries, the need for connectivity will increase, he added. Due to these advancements in demand, Openserve is focused on fibre – and will start decommissioning its copper network on which its DSL and landline services run. Beukes said having copper deployed does not make sense, particularly where other technologies, like fibre, have been deployed. That being said, Beukes noted that certain VDSL services have seen growth, along with demand for certain business products.
