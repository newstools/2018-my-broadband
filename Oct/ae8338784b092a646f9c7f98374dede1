Patreon announced it has partnered with Reddit in an effort to foster growth between creators and their communities. Patreon creators will now receive their own special flair, identifying them to their fans, and Reddit users will be able to sign up as a patron to certain creators directly from within Reddit. Users will also be able to promote their Patreon page on Reddit, with their patrons also receiving optional Patreon flair within a creator’s Reddit community. “We hope that our integration with Reddit offers you an easy way to excite your patrons, grow your business, and spend more time creating while your community thrives,” Patreon said. The company said that instructions for Reddit integration would become available to creators once the feature rolls out to more creators.
