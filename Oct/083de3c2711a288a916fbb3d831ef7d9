As of 26 October 2018, Xiaomi has reached a total of 100 million smartphones shipped, completing its annual target ahead of schedule, ZDNet reported. Xiaomi currently trails behind Huawei and Oppo in China, but it is taking on major competitors outside of its home country. The Chinese smartphone manufacturer has pulled away from Samsung in the Indian smartphone market, with 27% market share compared to Samsung’s 23%. Xiaomi has also begun expanding its reach to European countries, and has reportedly seen significant growth in these markets. CEO Lei Jun recently announced the manufacturer’s new Mi Mix 3 flagship smartphone, which boasts a 93.4% screen-to-body ratio and a mechanical sliding camera design. Xiaomi also raised $5.4 billion in an IPO earlier this year, which was followed by a steady drop in share price as many investors lost faith in the smartphone manufacturer.
