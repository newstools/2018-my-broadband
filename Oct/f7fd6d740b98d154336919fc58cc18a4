iOS 12 is already running on 50% of all Apple’s mobile consumer devices, the company has stated. The announcement comes less than a month after Apple released iOS 12 to the public. The quick adoption of the latest operating system on Apple mobile devices is a hallmark of the company’s hardware-software ecosystem. It is made possible, in part, to Apple’s support for older devices. iOS 12, for example, is compatible with devices launched several years ago, including the iPhone SE and iPhone 6. Apple added that, of the remaining devices, 39% are on iOS 11.
