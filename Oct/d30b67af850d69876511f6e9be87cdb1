Spotify has released an official app for Google’s WearOS operating system. The application will allow users to control music playback on Spotify directly on their smartwatch. Spotify’s WearOS app allows users to select tracks from their library, access auto-generated playlists, and control volume and other settings on their smartwatch. Users can also favourite songs on the WearOS app, saving it to their collection for later listening. “We’re excited to bring improved on-the-go-access to your favorite music and podcasts to millions of Spotify users on Wear OS by Google smartwatches,” said Spotify senior product director Mikael Ericsson. The company said that starting in November, Spotify will be auto-installed on all Fossil Gen 4 Smartwatches and Michael Kors Access Runway Smartwatches.
