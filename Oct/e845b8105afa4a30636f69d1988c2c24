Makro and Takealot are the clear favourites for Black Friday 2018 online shopping. This is according to the 2018 MyBroadband Black Friday survey. The survey was completed by 1,583 MyBroadband readers and forum members – who are tech-savvy and informed South Africans. The respondents were asked whether they plan to shop on Black Friday, and 81% stated yes. Respondents were also asked if they planned to shop online, at brick-and-mortar stores, or both – and which online stores they were set to buy from on the day. The table below shows the results of the question: “Do you plan to shop online, or at brick-and-mortar stores?”. Respondents were then asked, “Which online stores do you plan to shop at?” Multiple selections were allowed, and users voted strongly in favour of Takealot and Makro – which both stood out well above the rest of the competition. The table below details the results of the survey. Stores with low selection numbers were omitted from the table.
