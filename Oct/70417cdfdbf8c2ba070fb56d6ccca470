The Yes government jobs website, aimed at helping unemployed young South Africans, has come under heavy criticism from Solidarity. The website, and underlying Yes initiative, was launched by President Cyril Ramaphosa in March as a partnership with business and organised labour. It was set up to help young South Africans who have been unemployed for longer than six months find a job. “Yes recognises the critical role the youth play in shaping our economy and our country. Yet six million young people are shut out of the economy. The only way to reduce inequality is to get us all into work, to build incomes and to invest inclusively. Now is the time to lend a hand,” states the Yes website. Solidarity has stated that young, white South Africans are “unwelcome” however, as they cannot register on the website. “The problem is that on the Yes webpage, it blatantly declares to prospective white applicants that this project will only be open to black, coloured, and Indian candidates,” Solidarity said. The organisation stated that the exclusion is part of a “long list of policies obsessed with race”, and that exclusion based on race was becoming the norm. “We dare not allow racial exclusion to become commonplace and normal – the past has shown us how dangerous that is.” Solidarity said it will draft a letter to the President asking that this scheme should permit white people to apply. When registering on the Yes website, users are asked three questions: Selecting “no” to the first question, and yes to the other two questions, produces a pop-up which says: “I’m sorry. Yes is only available to Black, Indian, or Coloured South Africans who are 18 – 34 years.” The screenshot below show the registration page for the Yes website.
