Google’s new flagship Pixel 3 XL smartphone features an AMOLED display made by Samsung, according to a teardown of the device from iFixit. iFixit has taken apart Google’s Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL to investigate the devices’ components and repairability. The Pixel 3 XL is slightly less repair-friendly than the previous generation of Google flagships due to an increased amount of adhesive used in its construction. iFixit also noted that replacing the Samsung display in the Pixel 3 XL will be difficult, and would most likely require replacing the entire frame of the device. The chip attached to the display’s cable is the same Samsung touch controller seen on the Galaxy S9+. iFixit did not confirm whether the Pixel 3 also uses a Samsung display.
