Telkom recently launched new FreeMe prepaid bundles as part of its latest Summer promotion. Telkom said the prepaid promotion will run from 20 September to 20 January 2019, and that terms and conditions apply. The Telkom bundles include mobile data, along with free WhatsApp and YouTube data, and free Telkom minutes. These value-adds make the bundles very attractive to mobile users, as it allows them to use online services and access popular apps like WhatsApp while not eating into their primary data bundle. To see how Telkom’s new FreeMe bundles compare to traditional prepaid data bundles, we looked at what Vodacom and MTN offer users. Telkom’s FreeMe data bundles from 1GB to 20GB, valid for 31 days, are compared to Vodacom and MTN’s standard 31-day prepaid bundles in the table below.
