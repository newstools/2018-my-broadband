Buyers Laboratory LLC (BLI), a leading independent provider of analytical information and services to the digital imaging and document management industry, has reviewed the Xerox Versant 180 and Versant 3100. Each year, their expert team of analysts and lab technicians put production-class equipment through rigorous, hands-on testing, providing consumers with an invaluable independent resource that moves past marketing statements by evaluating product performance and validating product claims. “The Versant 180 and 3100 each has specific strengths and share important qualities for productions environments,” said Keypoint Intelligence Associate Director, George Mikolay. In testing the devices, BLI found the presses to perform at or near their rated speeds in nearly 50 print scenarios evaluated across all sizes and weights from 52 to 350 GSM. This shows that both devices will have no problem keeping up with the demands in mid-to-large size print shops. Its fast RIP speeds on BLI’s 1,600-page test file mean quicker processing of larger size files than you’ll find with most competitors. BLI further stated that both devices excel at simplifying complex tasks, they deliver perfect front-to-back registration, remarkable colour consistency, and are highly productive to meet daily deadlines.
