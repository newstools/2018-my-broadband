LG has unveiled a new PC monitor with HDR10 and AMD FreeSync support. The LG 32UK550-B has a 4K VA panel and supports AMD FreeSync up to 60Hz. It also packs HDR10 support, can display over a billion colours, and supports 95% of the DCI-P3 colour range. Engadget reported that the monitor is only available in Japan for now, and will sell for ¥55,000 when it launches on 11 October 2018. This converts to R6,900 – excluding appropriate taxes and duties. 4K PC monitors have come down in price since they first hit the market, and as graphics cards and games become more powerful they are an attractive option for gamers who want to play titles in maximum settings and resolutions.
