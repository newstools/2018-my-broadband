Poynting has partnered with Wi-Fi hotspot supplier We.Stream to provide South Africans with an affordable global roaming solution. We.Stream’s mobile Wi-Fi hotspot offers travellers secure mobile data in more than 100 countries for €99 per month. The device features a cloud-SIM, 2 SIM slots if you want to use your own SIMs, a built-in VPN, and a power bank with up to 15 hours of use. Poynting CEO Michael Howard explained that the price for roaming remains the same, no matter which global network you use. “You buy your data bundle online via the We.Stream portal or from the device with your credit card. If you run out of data, soft capping allows you still communicate, if only to buy more data,” he said. Howard added that the We.Stream VPN service allows corporates to offer their executives a solution where they can connect securely to a corporate network from anywhere in the world. Poynting is offering the We.Stream mobile Wi-Fi hotspot in South Africa for R2,699, which includes three free day passes.
