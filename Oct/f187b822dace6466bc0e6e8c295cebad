Cinemas in India are under pressure from the Tamil Film Producers Council to curb incidents of “camming” – a form of copyright infringement which involves recording films in theatres using a video camera, TorrentFreak reported. Unless cinemas install CCTV surveillance, conduct customer searches, and implement several other security measures, they will not be allowed to show any first-run movies. These measures must be implemented within a matter of weeks, according to the report. The report stated that the crackdown is an effort to help protect the local Indian movie scene. TorrentFreak said Bollywood produces a huge quantity of films every year, and thousands of them are available on international piracy sites. It also highlights that India’s Copyright Act of 1957 prescribes jail terms for up to three years, and fines of $2,700 for breaches. However, convictions for camming are rare.
