Samsung recently launched its Galaxy Note 9 512GB smartphone in South Africa. The device is priced at R25,999 locally and its local launch coincides with that of Apple’s iPhone Xs Max. The iPhone Xs Max is also available in a 512GB version, and sells for R31,999 at local retailers. Both devices are the top model in their respective line-ups, and the inclusion of 512GB of internal storage is truly impressive. What makes the Note 9 even more impressive, however, is support for a 512GB microSD card – bringing the device’s total storage capacity to 1TB. The iPhone Xs Max, like all iPhones, does not support a microSD card. The Galaxy Note 9 512GB version also sports more RAM than its lower-capacity Note 9 sibling – with 8GB of RAM installed. The 128GB version of the Galaxy Note 9, which was first to launch in SA, packs 6GB of RAM. Apple does not share its RAM specifications when unveiling its iPhones, but third-party tests have revealed that the iPhone Xs Max has 4GB of RAM. While substantially less than the Note 9, Apple users will tell you that the efficiency of the iPhone’s hardware and its tight integration with iOS makes up for the numerical difference. In terms of IP ratings, screen quality, cameras, and processing power, the devices both compete at a high level – with the iPhone Xs Max taking the lead in the CPU and GPU power department. Battery power is a more difficult one to measure, as Apple does not disclose it battery specs. Third-party tests show the iPhone Xs Max as having a 3,174mAh battery, however, while the Galaxy Note 9 features a 4,000mAh unit. The efficiency of these batteries will depend on the tasks executed, and Apple will again argue that its tight iPhone integration with iOS 12 makes its phone less power-hungry. The table below details the specifications of the phones. *Note: Apple does not divulge battery and RAM specifications. The figures displayed are based on third-party tests.
