Mozilla announced that it will run an experiment testing an in-browser VPN service with a small group of Firefox users. The experiment is set to kick off on 24 October, with an offer to purchase a monthly subscription to a VPN service. The select users will be able to download and install the VPN software after signing up for a paid subscription, which will have support for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. Mozilla said the VPN can be easily turned on and off, and the subscription can be cancelled at any time. Based on various criteria for a VPN service, Mozilla decided to make use of ProtonVPN for this experiment. “We examined each vendors’ privacy and data retention policies to ensure they logged as little user data as possible,” Mozilla said. “As a company [ProtonVPN] have a track record of fighting for online privacy and they share our dedication to Internet safety and security,” it added. Mozilla also noted that they will be the party to collect the payment from Firefox users who decide to subscribe, and that the proceeds will be shared with ProtonVPN. “In this way, subscribers will be directly supporting Mozilla while benefiting from one of the very best VPN services on the market today,” said Mozilla.
