Google has announced that it is shutting down Google+, its social network service. The announcement comes after the disclosure of a massive data leak by Google today, thanks to a bug in the Google+ API which affected up to 500,000 users. The bug shared user profile information with apps that was not meant to be publicly shared. The bug was patched in March 2018, but only detailed now. Google+ for consumer will be shuttered. The company added that the social network did not receive widespread adoption or engagement. Google+ Enterprise – intended for use in companies – will continue to operate, however.
