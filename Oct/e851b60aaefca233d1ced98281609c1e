MyBroadband has launched its 2018 DStv Channel Survey for South Africa, asking DStv users for their feedback. The survey will only take one minute to complete and your feedback will provide insight into which DStv channels users really want. Subscribers often state that they would like to pick their own channels on DStv, and the survey will give you a chance to have your opinion heard on the matter. You can also win a cool prize by taking part in the survey. Once you have completed the survey, please say “Done” in this forum thread to enter the prize draw. The prize up for grabs is a Google Chromecast 2nd Generation.
