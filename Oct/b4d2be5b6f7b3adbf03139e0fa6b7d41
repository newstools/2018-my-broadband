The latest iteration of Google’s Chromecast device has been leaked ahead of its unveiling on 9 October 2018. A Reddit user said he purchased a new Chromecast ahead of its launch from a Best Buy store, attaching an image of the unreleased hardware. The new version of the Chromecast features the same $35 price as the 2015 model and includes a number of subtle visual differences. Google has replaced the Chrome logo on the top of the device with its “G” logo it has been using on newer hardware, and the surface of the device no longer sports a glossy finish – but rather a matt texture. There is currently no information available regarding the specifications of the third-generation Chromecast, but Google is set to reveal more information next week.
