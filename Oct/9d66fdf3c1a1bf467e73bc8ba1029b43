Naspers has announced at the inaugural South Africa Investment Conference 2018 in Johannesburg that it will be investing R4.6 billion into the South African technology sector. Spanning the next three years, this investment includes a R1.4-billion commitment to the Naspers Foundry initiative – a fund dedicated to assisting South African startups. “The Naspers Foundry aims to both encourage and back South African entrepreneurs to create businesses which ensure South Africa benefits from this technology innovation,” said Naspers chief executive Bob van Dijk. Van Dijk added that since Naspers started in South Africa, the group understand the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of South Africans. “We believe the best ideas often start locally, with passionate entrepreneurs starting businesses that meet the needs of the communities they know best,” said van Dijk. The other R3.2 billion will be allocated to developing Naspers’ existing technology businesses, including OLX, Takealot, and Mr D Food.
