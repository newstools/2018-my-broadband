Boston Dynamics has published a new video to YouTube titled “UpTown Spot”, which features its SpotMini dog-like robot dancing to Bruno Mars’ Uptown Funk. The robotics company regularly uploads videos showing off the improved capabilities of its robots, but they usually include more serious activities such as obstacle course navigation and stability testing. The SpotMini featured in the video goes through a variety of different dance moves, including a rather impressive moonwalk that takes it out of the frame at the end of the clip. Boston Dynamics has previously stated that the SpotMini robot would be available for purchase in 2019, with production slowly ramping up to general availability. SpotMini is an all-electric robot that functions without hydraulics, and can run for about 90 minutes on a charge. Watch the SpotMini robot dancing along to Uptown Funk below:
