Microsoft has revealed a new pair of headphones, the Surface Headphones. The headphones feature 40mm free-edge drivers, up to 15 hours of battery life, and fast-charging capabilities. Microsoft has also included 13 levels of ambient noise control, along with 2 beam-forming microphones on each ear cup. This helps users “focus on the sounds you want to capture”, said the company. On-ear dial controls then allow users to adjust settings like volume and noise cancellation levels. The headphones are available for pre-order and sell for $349 in the US. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
