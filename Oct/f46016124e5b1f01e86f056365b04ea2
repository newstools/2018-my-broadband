Standard Bank has told MyBroadband that it plans to launch an MVNO in South Africa soon. A Standard Bank spokesperson said that while they will launch soon, they cannot share any additional details at this point. The move from Standard Bank comes after multiple MVNOs – mobile virtual network operators – have launched services in the country. This includes FNB’s mobile offering, FNB Connect. FNB Connect runs on Cell C’s network, and offers users voice and mobile data services. FNB Connect has also been integrated into FNB’s banking business, and bank customers can receive exclusive rewards and discounts. FNB has also launched FNB-branded smartphones – its ConeXis devices. Cell C is the dominant MVNO player in South Africa, providing cellular network services to a range of companies. Besides FNB, Cell C counts me&you mobile, Virgin Mobile, and Mr Price Mobile among its clients. “It uses the mobile network infrastructure provided by a mobile network operator like Cell C, but offers its own products and services, including billing and fulfilment on top of that network,” said Cell C of an MVNO.
