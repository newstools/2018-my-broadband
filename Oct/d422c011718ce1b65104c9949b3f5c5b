MetroFibre Networx has launched its new fibre ISP, GigaGo. GigaGo offers customers uncapped packages on both MetroFibre Networx and Openserve fibre networks, and the ISP will soon roll out availability to more networks. All GigaGo packages are uncapped and unshaped, and are subject to fair usage policies – depending on the line speed of the package. “At GigaGo we provide access to fast, reliable, and affordable Internet connectivity and believe that through the simplification of the process of acquiring Internet services, we can ensure that more people can experience the benefits of a connected lifestyle,” said Gigago head Cornelius Jansen van Rensburg. Uncapped packages with line speeds from 4Mbps-100Mbps are available, each with its own fair usage policy. The uncapped packages available from GigaGo, along with their pricing and throttling levels, are shown below.
