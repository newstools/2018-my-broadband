Huawei has officially launched its new Mate 20 Pro smartphone in South Africa, which will sell for R18,999. The Mate 20 Pro is a high-end, powerful smartphone, and is the first in the company’s line-up to sport its 7nm Kirin 980 processor. Huawei has made a number of hardware changes with the Mate 20 Pro, including redesigning the camera system and removing the physical fingerprint sensor. A triple-lens Leica camera system is located on the rear of the device’s chassis, and the device’s curved OLED display boasts an impressive 3,120 x 1,440 resolution. One of the most impressive features of the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is its large 4,200mAh battery. Thanks to the Mate 20 Pro’s glass back and unique charging hardware, the device can charge up to 70% in just 30 minutes, and can also be used as a portable power bank for other devices. By enabling the option on the Mate 20 Pro and laying the device on its front, users can charge any Qi-compatible device by simply placing it on the back of the Mate 20 Pro. The device also features a number of software-enhanced AI features integrated with its camera system, automatically optimising shots depending on the subject in the frame.
