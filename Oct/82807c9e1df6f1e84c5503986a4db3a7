More information about the upcoming OnePlus 6T smartphone has been revealed, thanks to an interview with CEO Pete Lau conducted by CNET. The OnePlus 6T is expected to launch in October 2018, and previous leaks have confirmed that it will feature an in-screen fingerprint sensor along with a notched OLED display. Speaking to CNET, Lau added that the upcoming device would also be more expensive than the OnePlus 6 – due to its new features. The OnePlus 6T won’t sport a headphone jack, an IP rating, or support for wireless charging technology, despite its higher price tag. Lau said certain design sacrifices were made to optimise the functionality of the in-screen fingerprint sensor, which OnePlus is calling Screen Unlock. “After you experience the Screen Unlock you’ll fall in love with it,” he said. “[You’ll] realise that it’s the experience that you wanted.”
