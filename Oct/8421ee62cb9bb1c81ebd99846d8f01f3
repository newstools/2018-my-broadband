I must be quick this morning – I have a meeting with the man who invented the download progress bar during the days of dial-up Internet. He’s going to be here in 20 minutes. Scratch that, he’s in traffic and will be here in 4 hours and 30 minutes. Oh wait, he’s found an open lane and will be here in 3 minutes. No, he’s stuck again – he will be here in 5 days.
