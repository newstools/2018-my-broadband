Takealot is by far the biggest online retail player in South Africa, and with this position comes pros and cons. The pros are that you are the go-to destination for the large majority of South Africans – first-time online shoppers are also likely to use Takealot due to its prominence. The downside is that you are constantly in the spotlight, and shoppers will call you out if they feel aggrieved. This was evident in 2018 when Takealot was taken before the ASA and accused of advertising false discounts and prices. Takealot’s Daily Deals have also come under scrutiny, and in an ASA case in June 2018, the company was found guilty of misleading pricing. Takealot promoted a Samsung 55-inch UHD TV in a Daily Deals promotion for R15,999 – a discount of 40% on the “List Price” of R26,000. A consumer lodged a complaint, highlighting that the normal price prior to this promotion was R18,225. Takealot subsequently explained the difference between the “list price” and its own “normal selling price”. Takealot said the “list price” is clearly explained in the advertising, but the ASA ruled against Takealot. To see if Takealot’s Daily Deals are serving up good prices or “misleading” consumers, we selected a range of tech items from the store’s deals section on 22 October. The items were chosen at random and compared against pricing from competing stores, including Makro, Raru, and PC retailer Wootware. What we found was that the Daily Deals were surprisingly good, and Takealot had competitive pricing compared to the other stores. The “list prices” from which the discounts were calculated were also in line with the market, except in the case of an Xbox 360 game. The results of the investigation are shown in the tables below. All pricing was taken on the morning of 22 October 2018.
