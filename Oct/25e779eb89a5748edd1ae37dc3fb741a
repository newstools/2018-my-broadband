Engadget reports that XDA contributor Kieron Quinn has found code references and a survey which imply that Google is considering an app subscription service. The survey mentions that the service would include hundreds of dollars of apps for a monthly fee, and would be called “Play Pass”. Any implementation of this service appears far away, however, as various questions remain on Google’s plate. One of these questions revolves around how Google would decide which apps are included in Play Pass, and which are excluded. Android app subscription services have been tried before, but given that the Play Store makes significantly less revenue than the Apple equivalent, Google may commit more effort into making this iteration a success.
