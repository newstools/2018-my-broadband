As clients become increasingly digital in their personal lives, they expect the same from businesses – which is why now is a good time for accountants to digitise their businesses. The industry is going through a massive shift and accountants face the perfect opportunity to provide real value to their clients. In an age of digitisation and technology commoditisation, nothing is more valuable than the human connection. By using the tools available to them today – like artificial intelligence (AI) – accountants have an opportunity to leverage the craving for human connection to enable those relationships, add more value to clients, and make more revenue. Listen to Kriti Sharma, VP of Artificial Intelligence at Sage where she discusses the important role that AI will play for accountants in this episode of the Sage #NextGenAccounting Podcast series.
