Makro has been preparing for Black Friday 2018 for nine months already, and will take many measures to ensure a great experience for customers. This is according to a report on BusinessTech, which said South Africans can expect items like high-tech products and appliances at big discounts from Makro on Black Friday 2018. To cope with the increased number of shoppers on 23 November 2018, Makro will be rolling out a new mobile pay-point system in its stores. This addition will assist consumers to pay for purchases while standing in the queue, the company explained. “To better service our customers over Black Friday, we have increased the number of staff and security at all our stores,” Makro said. The company added that deliveries for both online and in-store purchases over Black Friday will cost R70, regardless of the radius. One of the biggest innovations from Makro for Black Friday is an online drive-thru service at its Riversands store, enabling customers to collect their online purchases. The company explained how the online service will work: This is the first time Makro will be offering this service to its customers.
