Facebook has announced that it will be bringing its Instant Games feature to groups and to its Lite app. The HTML5 “cross-platform gaming experience” was previously available on Messenger and on Facebook News Feed. Facebook is now starting to roll out Instant Games for groups to some gaming groups, rolling it out soon thereafter to all gaming groups. Facebook also said that it is “exploring Instant Games as an opt-in feature in group categories outside of gaming”. It added that offering the gaming feature on the Lite app will demonstrate how the platform can “provide a compelling gaming experience regardless of phone or network constraints”. “We’re continuing to work hard at making Instant Games a better experience for FB Lite users by improving in thread updates, as well,” said Facebook.
