The website for the ANC is still offline after more than a week, and is now displaying the message: “This website is suspended due to non-payment to the service provider.” This comes after the ANC denied it was in a dispute with the company which hosted its website, Unwmebi Communications. Business Live reported that a lawyer’s letters from Unwembi alleged the ANC owes R32.5 million for a “membership system agreement” and the development, hosting, and support of its websites. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe denied that the organisation’s website was down due to non-payment. “I don’t know what hogwash that is, we don’t owe anyone R32 million,” Mabe was quoted as saying. According to the report, Unwembi sent the ANC a legal letter stating the party owed R26.5 million under a “member system agreement”. It owed another R6 million for hosting and support of the ANC’s websites. Unwembi also asked the ANC to pay R467,412 in damages for allegedly breaching the agreements, the report stated. Unwembi Communications did not respond to a request for comment on the reported non-payment.
