PlayStation 4 owners are reporting that their consoles are being crashed by malicious messages. According to Engadget, the offending PSN message contains an unrecognised character which “effectively bricks their consoles”. After the console crashes, users then “have to either rebuild the database in Safe Mode or factory reset the system”. To prevent the possibility of your console being affected, users can go the the Settings menu in their PS4 and change their privacy settings so the option to receive messages is turned off. Sony did not provide comment to Engadget on the matter.
