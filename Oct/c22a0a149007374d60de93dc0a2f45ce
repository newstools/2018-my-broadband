Apple has unveiled its new iPad Pro at an event in New York. The overhauled device features a redesigned bezel which removes the home button from the front to accommodate more screen space. Apple’s new iPad Pro display panel supports Apple Pencil and includes various display quality features, in addition to a 120Hz refresh rate. It comes in two sizes – the smaller iPad Pro features an 11-inch display, but is the same size as the previous-generation 10.5-inch iPad Pro thanks to its bezel-less design. The bigger 12.9-inch tablet sports the same display size as the previous-generation device but in a smaller chassis. Apple’s new iPad Pro also includes FaceID, which Apple said is the most secure facial recognition to be implemented on any tablet or computer. Apple’s new iPad Pro devices also feature overhauled hardware specifications. The new devices are powered by Apple’s A12X Bionic processor, which is built on a 7nm manufacturing process. This offers a dramatic performance improvement compared to the previous generation of iPad Pros, with up to 35% faster single-core performance and 90% faster multi-core processing. Apple added that the GPU on its new A12X Bionic chipset delivers “Xbox One S-class graphics”. The company also said that its new iPad Pros are “faster than 92% of all portable PCs sold in the past 12 months, including Core i7 models sold by mainstream laptop manufacturers”. The devices sport up to 1TB storage capacity and now include a USB Type-C connector for improved functionality. Apple also launched its new Pencil alongside the iPad Pros, which attaches to the side of the iPad Pro magnetically, automatically pairs with the device, and starts charging wirelessly. Both iPad Pro models will be available in Wi-Fi-only and Wi-Fi+LTE models. The second-generation Pencil for the new iPad Pro will be available for $129. These devices are available for pre-order and will begin shipping on 7 November 2018.
