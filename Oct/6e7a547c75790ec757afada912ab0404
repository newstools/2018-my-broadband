Fibre-to-the-home is gaining momentum in South Africa, but the reality is that most fixed-broadband subscribers in the country still use ADSL. According to the latest Telkom results, nearly one million South African homes and businesses rely on ADSL and VDSL for their fixed broadband needs. While DSL is an inferior technology to fibre-to-the-home, it is more affordable for high usage than mobile broadband or fixed-LTE solutions. Fixed LTE products from Rain, Telkom, and Cell C offer better value for money than DSL for capped accounts of around 100GB per month. However, when you move into hundreds of gigabytes per month an uncapped account reigns supreme, and this is where ADSL comes into its own. Telkom’s UNLIMITEDhome products crush the competition in the uncapped DSL market. While its prices are lower than competing ISPs for most products, it hides the true value of what Telkom is offering. Telkom’s UNLIMITEDhome products include landline rental, free Telkom Mobile data, and unlimited anytime calls for up to an hour per call to Telkom numbers. Here is how the products from other ISPs compare to Telkom’s UNLIMITEDhome products.
