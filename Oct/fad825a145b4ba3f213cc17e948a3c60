Hackers and virus creators are consistently coming up with new ways to gain access to business networks. As a result, many companies have implemented significant network security measures to protect themselves from digital attacks. Unfortunately, these measures often do not extend to printer networks, since these are seen to be less significant by many network administrators. However, these under-protected networks are exactly what malignant digital actors are looking for in their attempts to enter and attack your business’s digital systems. In a survey of over 300 IT professionals, 23% were found to be leaving data on their printing networks vulnerable to being read if intercepted. Additionally, 91% of visual hacking attempts were found to be successful in global trials run by the Ponemon Institute. Once your printing network has been breached, viruses and hackers can often gain access to the rest of your business network and can also intercept the printing jobs being sent to your printer. This means that hackers and viruses see printing networks as a practical route to gaining access to your business network and accessing your company’s private information. It is therefore of the utmost importance that you keep your printing network secure from bad actors. In 2016, the IDC predicted that 33% of all organisations will be engaged in a contract with a print security vendor by 2019. HP has been a leading player in the printing market for decades, and the company is at the forefront when it comes to print security solutions.
