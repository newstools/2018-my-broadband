Amazon introduced its new Kindle Paperwhite today, which features a thinner, lighter design, sleek flush-front display, and waterproofing. The new Paperwhite also comes with support for Audible, allowing you to listen to professionally narrated audiobooks. It is the lightest and thinnest Kindle Paperwhite, measuring 8.18mm in thickness and weighing in at 182g. It features a 6-inch display, with a pixel density of 300 pixels-per-inch. The new Paperwhite also includes five LEDs and an adjustable front light, which helps prevent glare in any setting. The most impressive feature of the new Paperwhite is itâ€™s IPX8 rating, which means it is waterproofed against immersion up to two metres of fresh water for up to 60 minutes. This Kindle Paperwhite also boasts more storage than its predecessors, and includes 8GB and 32GB versions. Bluetooth has now been built into the Paperwhite, too, allowing you to connect speakers or headphones. Amazon is also including a free 6-months subscription to Kindle Unlimited, which will cost $9.99 per month thereafter. The new Kindle Paperwhite will start at $129.99 for the 8GB model and range up to $249.99 for the 32GB model with cellular connectivity.
