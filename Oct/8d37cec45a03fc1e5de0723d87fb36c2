Microsoft has officially closed the deal to acquire social code repository GitHub for $7.5 billion in stock, TechCrunch reported. The deal received approval from EU regulators last week, clearing the path for the acquisition. According to Microsoft, GitHub will continue to operate independently. It will be led by Nat Friedman, the former CEO of Xamarin and a current Microsoft developer tools executive. Friedman announced in a blog post that his first day will be on Monday. He also confirmed Microsoft’s promise that GitHub will continue to be language agnostic and support whatever tools and operating systems developers choose to use. “We will start by focusing on the daily experience of using GitHub and will double down on our paper cuts project,” Friedman said. “We will improve core scenarios like search, notifications, issues/projects, and our mobile experience. And of course we are excited to make GitHub Actions broadly available.”
