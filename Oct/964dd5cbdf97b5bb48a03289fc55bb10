Liquid Telecom SA has announced a new digitally-enhanced operating model, which includes the automation of many tasks for which people are currently responsible. The new operating model, coupled with increased automation, will see retrenchments taking place at the telecoms operator. Speaking to MyBroadband about the new operating model, Liquid Telecom SA CEO Reshaad Sha said it was a result of an assessment of the company’s existing business. He explained that the assessment found areas that were not optimally suited for their business, which necessitated a change in the way the company operates. A change was needed to position the company for future growth, and the Liquid Telecom SA board approved the new operating model and “large-scale retrenchments”. The company introduced the new operating model to employees on 1 October and started the consultation process with those who are affected by the new organisational structure. The extent of the retrenchments will only be established after the consultation process. The company will also offer voluntary early retirement packages to qualifying employees over the age of 55.
