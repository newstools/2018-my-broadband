Pricing for Apple’s “more affordable” smartphone, the iPhone Xr, has been listed in South Africa. The iPhone Xr will start shipping on 26 October, and sells for R15,999 for the 64GB model. While this may sound like a good price for a new iPhone in 2018, there are two problems – this is not a flagship device, and it is more expensive than top-end Android smartphones. The iPhone Xr was unveiled alongside the iPhone Xs and Xs Max by Apple, the two flagship models in its 2018 line-up. The Xs starts at R21,999 locally, while the Xs Max starts at R23,999. This makes the iPhone Xr the “poor man’s ” iPhone, thanks to its lower price. It is not only the price that is different, however – the Xr sports less-impressive specifications in certain areas. While the Xr runs iOS 12, features the powerful A12 Bionic processor, and sports dual-SIM functionality, it falls short in many other areas when compared to the Xs and Android flagships. This disparity is compounded when you look at the price of Android flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S9 – which is currently available for R12,999 in South Africa. Key differences include: Another aspect to consider is technology support in South Africa, of which Samsung Pay is a big plus. With support for Samsung Pay, the S9 can be used to make payments at virtually any paypoint in South Africa. Apple’s version of this, Apple Pay, is not supported locally – a fact which many Apple users have complained about. With flagship features and power, and a much lower price point, users interested in buying an iPhone Xr may get a serious lecture from their Android counterparts about paying premium prices for a “non-premium” device.
