GitHub has published its latest State of the Octoverse report, looking at trends in the software development industry. The report shows what the GitHub community has “accomplished on GitHub this year”, and looks at aspects like popular programming languages and projects. GitHub also looked at the lighter side of software development in the report, including the top emoji reactions by programming language for 2018. The ranking is based on the percentage (out of 100) of each reaction type by programming language. “You’ve reacted to public comments on topics from managing code to managing depression. This year, you also congratulated members of the open source community and found abstract art in IE7,” stated GitHub. The report shows popular emoji and how contributors to a language use those emoji. For example, contributors to Ruby offer the highest percentage of heart emoji, at 10.2%. The thumbs-up emoji is favoured among Java users, while the thumbs-down is in the domain of C#. The graphic below shows the emoji tracked by GitHub in the report.
