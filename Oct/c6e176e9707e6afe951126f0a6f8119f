Amazon has announced that Amazon Web Services will open data centres in South Africa. The new AWS Infrastructure Region, opening in the first half of 2020, will “enable customers to run workloads in South Africa and serve end-users across the African continent with even lower latency”, said Amazon. The AWS Africa Region will be located in Cape Town and consist of three availability zones. “Currently, AWS provides 55 Availability Zones across 19 infrastructure regions worldwide,” said Amazon. “Having built the original version of Amazon EC2 in our Cape Town development centre 14 years ago, we’ve been able to witness first-hand the technical talent and potential in Africa,” said Andy Jassy, CEO at Amazon Web Services. Amazon opened a development centre in Cape Town in 2004, and in 2015 it opened an AWS office in Johannesburg. Amazon added that local AWS customers will also be able to store their data in South Africa, while those looking to comply with POPI will have access to “secure infrastructure that meets the most rigorous international compliance standards”.
