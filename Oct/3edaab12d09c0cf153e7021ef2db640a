Internet Solutions (IS) has confirmed two new CloudConnect partnerships with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud, which are offered as fully-managed connectivity services. These partnerships make IS the only ISP in South Africa to offer dedicated links to three of the world’s largest public cloud platforms. IS said its strategy is to remain cloud service provider agnostic, allowing enterprises to connect with the providers of their choice, regardless of their industry. The ISP’s CloudConnect platform provides instant provisioning, flexible storage, data security, and a choice of pay-as-you-use or pay-as-you-grow models to customers. “We want to ensure that our clients have the connectivity their specific ecosystem requires, and that we can offer them the choice of hyper-exchange from any-to-as-many cloud platforms that works best for their needs and business applications, while increasing the speed of their transactions by approximately 25%,” said IS VPN executive head Gopal Govinder. Govinder said that while many of the cloud exchange partners do not have a direct in-country presence, which adds a level of complexity to the CloudConnect offering, he is confident in IS’s ability to connect customers via the company’s global centres in London and Frankfurt. CloudConnect currently offers direct access to cloud platforms from Microsoft, AWS, Google, IS, and Dimension Data.
