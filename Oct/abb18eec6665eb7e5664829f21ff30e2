Google’s Gboard now includes a feature that lets you move the keyboard to any point you want on the screen, according to AndroidPolice. By using a small handle at the bottom of the Gboard to undock it, you can now drag it around to wherever is most comfortable for you. You are also able to resize the Gboard, which may be an ideal feature for those who need to type with one hand – letting you comfortably reach the other end of the keyboard. The Gboard will also go transparent if left untouched for a few moments, allowing you to see the app behind it. Many users are already able to access the feature, and it should be rolling out soon to all users of the app.
