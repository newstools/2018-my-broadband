Uber has launched Ride Pass, a subscription service which promises users lower prices. Ride Pass is a way for riders to lock in “consistent, low prices on any ride they take, anywhere in a city, anytime of day”. The service is $14.99 per month and is currently on offer in a handful of US cities. “Ride Pass is designed to take the guesswork out of riding so you can confidently plan your day with Uber without any unwelcome surprises,” added Uber. Rates will reportedly be based on historical data and not fluctuate depending on external factors like demand surge, which is currently the case with Uber rides. It was not stated if this feature will roll out to more cities around the world.
