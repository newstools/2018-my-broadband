Google has launched its new Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL smartphones at its MadeByGoogle 2018 launch event. The new Pixel smartphones feature improved camera systems and will ship with Android 9.0 installed, offering owners the latest Android features. The company built its Pixel Visual Core and HDR+ support into its new devices to improve picture quality, and its Top Shot feature allows users to select the best frame possible out of alternate shots captured over a short period of time. Pixel 3 and older Pixels will also support a new software feature which drastically improves low-light shots, and the latest smartphone sports a pair of front-facing cameras for improved selfie quality and a new group selfie cam feature. Google said its Pixel 3 is designed to be the the “smartest, most helpful device in your life”, offering improved accessibility features such as enhanced Assistant integration. The Assistant on the device can automatically answer suspected spam calls for you and transcribe them, for example, screening them to help you decide whether to answer or not. Both smartphones are powered by Snapdragon 845 processors, with the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL sporting 4GB of RAM and up to 128GB of internal storage. Google’s new smartphones also feature redesigned OLED displays, with the Pixel 3 XL featuring a notch and edge-to-edge display. Pixel 3 is also the first phone to ship with the YouTube Music streaming experience, and owners will be able to enjoy the service for free for six months. Google’s Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL smartphones are available in three colours – Just Black, Clearly White, and Not Pink. The devices are currently available for pre-order and will begin shipping from 17 October 2018 in the United States.
