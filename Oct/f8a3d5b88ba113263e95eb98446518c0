Tony Gupta allegedly offered Free State economic development MEC Mxolisi Dukwana R2 million a month for 10 years to give the Gupta family control of a lucrative City of Tomorrow contract. This is according to a report in City Press, which said the “New City or City of Tomorrow” project was expected to take a decade to complete, and involved a R41.8 billion investment. “The new city project was intended to take advantage of the fibre optic cables that ran through the Free State to roll out basic infrastructure and promote economic development in the areas of Lejweleputswa,” City Press said. According to Dukwana, he “presented a master plan concept document for a New City or City of Tomorrow to the Free State executive council, chaired by Magashule as premier”. Dukwana linked ANC Secretary General and former Free State Premier Ace Magashule with the deal, saying Magashule took him to the Guptas in Saxonwold. After Dukwana declined the offer from the Gupta family he was fired, with the excuse that it was done to make way for a more gender balanced cabinet in the province. The “New City or City of Tomorrow” project in the Free State failed to take off. Magashule has rejected accusations that he brought Dukwana to the Gupta family to discuss the deal, calling it unjustified “lies”. “The accusations of Comrade Dukwana are not only unfounded and malicious, but are also based on fabrications, which is a shame,” Magashule said. “The accusations are nothing more than an attempt to promote character murder and to further derive the direct task of unity and renewal.”
