Seven members of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) have been charged for stealing and disseminating the personal information of anti-doping officials and 250 athletes following the 2014 Sochi Olympics, The Verge reported. The US Department of Justice brought the charges, which include computer hacking, wire fraud, money laundering, and identity theft. GRU is incorporated within the Russian military, and three of the officers charged were also indicted in the Mueller investigation for hacking the Democratic National Convention. It is alleged that they tried to compromise the infrastructure of the US elections in 2016. According to the indictment, the GRU hackers began their campaign around December 2014, which continued until at least May 2018. They targeted anti-doping organisations and officials who had publicly exposed a Russian state-sponsored athlete doping programme, and worked to damage the reputations of athletes around the world by falsely claiming that such athletes were using banned or performance-enhancing drugs. “State-sponsored hacking and disinformation campaigns pose serious threats to our security and to our open society, but the Department of Justice is defending against them,” said US Attorney General Jeff Sessions. “Today we are indicting seven GRU officers for multiple felonies each, including the use of hacking to spread the personal information of hundreds of anti-doping officials and athletes as part of an effort to distract from Russia’s state-sponsored doping program,” Sessions said. “The defendants in this case allegedly targeted multiple Americans and American entities for hacking, from our national anti-doping agency to the Westinghouse Electric Company near Pittsburgh. We are determined to achieve justice in these cases and we will continue to protect the American people from hackers and disinformation.”
