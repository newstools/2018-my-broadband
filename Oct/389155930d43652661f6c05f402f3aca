Apple has announced that the 15-inch MacBook Pro will get new graphics options that will bring Radeon Pro Vega to the laptops for the first time. The options will offer Radeon Pro Vega 16 and Vega 20 models that Apple promises deliver up to 60% faster graphics performance. The increased graphics performance is aimed at demanding video editing, 3D design, and rendering workloads. Although the graphics performance may not outperform that of the iMac Pro desktop GPUs, the Radeon Pro Vega options will certainly close the gap. The Radeon Pro Vega options will be available to buyers in late November 2018.
