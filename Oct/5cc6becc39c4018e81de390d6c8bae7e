Rain has announced it will showcase South Africa’s first live 5G network in the second week of November. The data-only mobile network operator has sent out an invitation to an event which will demonstrate its live 5G network on 12-13 November in Cape Town. Rain said the event would cover the engineering behind its 5G network, the social and economic implications of the technology for South Africa, and the impact of 5G on education. The operator also recently announced that it would give free off-peak data to all active fixed-LTE users on its network. This follows the suspension of fixed-LTE sales through partner ISPs earlier this year, with Rain citing network capacity constraints as a reason for the suspension.
