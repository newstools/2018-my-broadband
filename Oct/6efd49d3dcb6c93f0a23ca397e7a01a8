MyBroadband has launched the Big South African Fibre-to-the-Home Survey, which gathers information about fibre availability and choices in South Africa. The survey will only take one minute to complete, and you can win R10,000 in prizes. Whether you want fibre but cannot get it, have it already, or do not need it â€“ we need your feedback. Your feedback is really important to provide an accurate overview of the fibre market in South Africa. It will also help us see which areas have no coverage but have demand for fibre-to-the-home.
