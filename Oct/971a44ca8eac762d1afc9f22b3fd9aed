The FBI recently forced a suspect in a child abuse case to unlock their iPhone X which was secured with Face ID, Forbes reported, citing court documents. After searching the suspect’s house, the FBI charged him with receiving and possessing child pornography and obtained a search warrant that allowed them to go through his phone. The suspect complied with investigators and unlocked his phone. This is the first known case where a law enforcement agency used Face ID to unlock a suspect’s phone, the report stated. According to the report, the FBI agent investigating the case found incriminating emails on the device. However, the suspect’s lawyer said that the FBI didn’t find any “contraband” on the iPhone X. This was a “pyrrhic victory,” the lawyer said, as contraband was discovered on some of the suspect’s other devices.
