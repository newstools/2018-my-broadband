Comstor Southern Africa is pleased to announce the launch of its Comstor Imagine programme, a highly focussed partner programme for NetApp solutions to help drive powerful channel enablement throughout the Southern Africa region. The goal of the programme is to provide channel enablement, sales support, incentives and rewards to help Comstor partners provide differentiation in services as well as improve profitability. “As the demands of end-users are evolving from pure product requirements to solution-focussed offerings, we are seeing that our partners are finding it increasingly difficult and expensive to retain and skill staff,” states Louise Taute, Comstor Director Southern Africa at Westcon-Comstor. “The Comstor Imagine programme has been expressly designed to help address these challenges, as well as challenges that extend to lack of sales knowledge and demand generation initiatives.” Key to the programme is building out an understanding of not just a host of NetApp technologies, but also the challenges facing a customer when building new technology environments. This is particularly relevant to customers that need to bed down infrastructures that include disparate technologies and solutions from dispersed cloud environments and legacy on-premise environments that now need to be monitored and managed for data insights. The initial launch will provide a series of services and assets that have been developed around a series of core technologies within the NetApp stable, delivering a full remit of support services to partners. The initial technologies include: NetApp OnCommand Insight (OCI) IT infrastructure monitoring; Backup & recovery with NetApp E-Series and Veeam; NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP (formerly ONTAP Cloud); NetApp HCI; NetApp ONTAP Select; and NetApp SolidFire All-Flash solutions. Two dedicated offerings exclusive to the Imagine programme include the Comstor DC-in-a-Box solution which consists of Cisco UCS C-Series servers, Cisco Meraki networking, VMware vSphere and NetApp ONTAP Select. Another tailored package is the Comstor FlexPod express Solution, made up of Cisco UCS C-Series servers, Nexus 5K Switches, NetApp FAS2700/A220, VMware vSphere/ Microsoft Hyper-V and Comstor professional prices. All offerings come with the channel enablement benefits of the Imagine programme and are competitively priced for partners. “NetApp is a highly relevant vendor in a market where data is itself king, and for a future that is defined by the hybrid cloud. With the Comstor Imagine programme we will help our partners to develop and thrive as top NetApp solutions providers and stay ahead of the changing technology landscape,” ends Taute.
