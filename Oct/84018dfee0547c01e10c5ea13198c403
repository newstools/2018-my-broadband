Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company’s upcoming Tesla Model Y SUV will go into production, The Verge reports. Speaking at an earnings call with investors, Musk said Tesla has made significant progress on the Model Y, although full-volume production of the vehicle is not set to begin until 2020. Musk has approved the final prototype of the electric SUV, but the carmaker does not yet have any capacity to begin production at its facilities. He added that he was also excited about the production of a Tesla pickup truck. “I think that’s going to be some next level stuff there,” Musk said. “I think we’ve got the most exciting product roadmap of any company on Earth by far.” Tesla recently reached a milestone after producing 100,000 Model 3 vehicles, and is currently manufacturing vehicles at a rate of over 1,000 per day.
