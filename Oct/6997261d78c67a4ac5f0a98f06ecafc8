Microsoft has provided details on its Windows 10 October 2018 update and the issues which caused the software to delete users’ files. “We have fully investigated all reports of data loss, identified and fixed all known issues in the update, and conducted internal validation,” said Microsoft. The company said the deletion bug was caused by changes made to the Known Folder Redirection (KFR). The changes were made after user feedback from the April 2018 update said the KFR created empty folders on PCs. Microsoft then changed the code for the KFR in the October update, which caused files to be deleted. “That change, combined with another change to the update construction sequence, resulted in the deletion of the original old folder locations and their content, leaving only the new active folder intact.” “We have fully investigated these issues and developed solutions that resolve these scenarios, so the original old folder location and its contents remain intact.”
