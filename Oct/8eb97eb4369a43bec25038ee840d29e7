The executive head of the insurance comparison website Hippo.co.za, Vera Nagtegaal, says insurers should look at bridging the gap between funeral cover and other life insurance products, through digital offerings that are easy to use, particularly for millennials. “For millennials sandwiched in a pile of debt and shouldering the responsibility of caring for their ageing parents or extended families, adding the cost of a funeral to their other financial obligations could spell financial disaster,” Nagtegaal says. She says insurers have an opportunity to bridge the gap between funeral policies and other financial products by remodeling their products, while also making them attractive to millennials. This gap can help drive consumer awareness campaigns, that inform consumers about the value of life and disability cover, in addition to funeral cover, she adds. “The rise of simple and quick insurance solutions – made available via mobile apps, simple SMS services that come with other products, means that there’s now more exposure than ever to insurance products for all South Africans,” Nagtegaal says. She advises insurers to use debt to better understand millennial values. They should make it simple for millennials taking up their offerings to understand what they’re getting into, she says. “Transparency is key with millennials. If you can’t be upfront and make the policies easy to understand, it’s likely that they’ll turn away.” Like all policies, it’s important to go through the fine print to be aware of what conditions or exclusions are attached. You should know why your funeral cover claim could be rejected in order to avoid a situation where the provider will not pay you out, she concludes.
