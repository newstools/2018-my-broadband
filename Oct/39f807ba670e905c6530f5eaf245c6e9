WhatsApp is working on new features to improve chats and notifications, and these features are now starting to roll out to users. Silent Mode The latest WhatsApp feature is silent mode, which allows users to hide the app badge for muted chats. According to WABetaInfo, the new silent mode feature is already active for Android users and is enabled by default. This means that, unlike previously, users will not see a badge when they receive a message from muted WhatsApp chats and groups. Vacation Mode WhatsApp is also working on a vacation mode, which will stop archived chats being un-archived if users have muted them. WhatsApp currently automatically reverses archived chats once a new message is received from that chat. LinkedIn Another feature which will arrive soon is the ability to link a WhatsApp account to external services like LinkedIn. “The feature appears mainly developed for WhatsApp Business, but some references were found in the normal WhatsApp app too. It’s not available yet for both apps,” WABetaInfo said.
