Apple has a ton of cool features it offers users when they buy a device. In South Africa, the iPhone is a popular smartphone, and its operating system – iOS – lets users conduct an array of tasks. This includes everything from navigating with Maps to messaging and calling friends with FaceTime using a data connection. Many great iOS features are not available in South Africa, however, including Apple Pay. Apple Pay lets users load bank cards and pay for items at a point of sale using their smartphone. It also lets users store loyalty cards, which they can present to earn shopper points and the like. Samsung recently launched support for Samsung Pay in the country, offering a similar service to Samsung smartphone owners.
