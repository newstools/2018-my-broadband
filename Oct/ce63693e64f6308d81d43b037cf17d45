Samsung Electronics has announced its acquisition of Zhilabs, a company that offers AI-based network and service analytics. “The acquisition lays the foundation for Samsung to foster its 5G offerings of automation and network analytics to finely tune the customer experiences in the 5G era,” Samsung said. According to Samsung, AI-based automation will play a central role in the introduction of new services in the 5G era, such as industrial Internet of Things and connected cars. Network operators will require automated solutions and network analytics beyond what was possible in previous mobile generations, and AI-based services can be used to analyse user traffic, classify applications being used, and improve overall service quality. Following the acquisition, Zhilabs will be fully owned by Samsung, but will continue to operate independently under its own management.
