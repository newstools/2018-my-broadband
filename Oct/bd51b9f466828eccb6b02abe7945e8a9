FNB has launched the latest feature for its nav>> platform on its mobile banking app, allowing customers to list and sell their homes privately. FNB customers are able to sell their homes to buyers who most likely qualify for a home loan, saving a number of costs associated with the process of property sales. “With over 8 million properties registered in the deeds office, we see a significant opportunity to become a game-changer in the property industry,” said FNB Retail CEO Raj Makanjee. “Substantial investment has been made to ensure that our digital platforms are not only helpful but also built to enhance the overall customer experience; ultimately helping consumers to help themselves.” Sellers can use the new feature on the FNB nav>> platform to engage with potential buyers, arrange for property viewings, and negotiate on the price of the property via FNB’s secure chat. Buyers and sellers also can disclose personal contact information when they are comfortable to do so. FNB explained that there were numerous benefits to selling and buying properties through the app. Sellers will have access to thousands of buyers who are most likely to qualify for a home loan and are able to calculate their savings upfront. The bank said its six-step property listing process is quick and convenient, and sellers will be able to monitor the number of views on their listing along with other listings in their area. FNB said that from a buyer perspective, customers can request approval for a home loan quickly through the app and access other nav>> Home tools like calculators, instant free value estimates, and property reports. Buyers can also get 50% back in eBucks on their first home loan repayment and up to 50% off bond registration fees with a selected panel of attorneys. “This latest innovation forms part of our broader strategy to be a bank which does more to help its customers through its integrated digital banking solutions,” said Makanjee.
