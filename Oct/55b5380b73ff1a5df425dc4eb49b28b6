Qualcomm has announced a new family of 60GHz Wi-Fi chipsets that are capable of delivering more than 10Gbps network speeds. Qualcomm’s 60GHz Wi-Fi solution is the first to hit the market with optimizations based on the 802.11ay specification, which enables high speeds and wide coverage. “Our 11ay solution provides the industry with the critical building blocks needed to take connectivity performance to the next level,” said Rahul Patel, senior vice president and general manager of connectivity and networking at Qualcomm. The new chips – the QCA64x8 and QCA64x1 ranges – also set the “industry low-power benchmark for extended battery life”. The QCA64x8 chipsets will be used for infrastructure and fixed wireless access, and the QCA64x1 chipsets are designed for mobile applications. The mmWave-based 60GHz Wi-Fi is distinct from the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands in that it is a low-interference, bandwidth-rich spectrum that “delivers increased wireless capacity, multi-gigabit speeds, and ultra-low latency”. A major prospect for this new Wi-Fi technology is in the realms of gaming and virtual reality (VR). Qualcomm said that due to the double-digit Gbps speeds, the new Wi-Fi solutions provide wire-equivalent latencies that will enable new experiences such as 4K streaming and wireless virtual and augmented reality, while providing high power efficiency. Qualcomms new chipsets will not only improve on performance, but they will also enable unique, always-on ambient Wi-Fi sensing capabilities.
