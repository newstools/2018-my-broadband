Vodacom and MTN are two of South Africaâ€™s most successful companies, with operations in countries across Africa and the Middle East. While mobile operators are scrambling to find new ways to make money without growth in voice revenues, they are still generating lots of cash. MTN, which has 217 million subscribers in the 22 countries where it operates, generated R133 billion in revenue in its last financial year. Vodacom, which has 103 million subscribers in the 6 countries where it has operations, generated R86.4 billion in revenue. Despite these strong revenues, investors are not as keen on the mobile operators as what they were a few years ago. This is partly due to the risks of operating in Africa, and also because the move from providing voice services to providing data products. Data networks require very large investments, which make it difficult to maintain the same margins as with voice networks. While local telecoms companies are no longer the darlings of the investment community, you do not have to feel too sorry for them. MTN, Vodacom, and Telkom are still making lots of money, and with million of subscribers they can find new revenue streams to offset lagging voice traffic.
