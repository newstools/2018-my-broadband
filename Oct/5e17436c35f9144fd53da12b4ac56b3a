A new Kickstarter campaign has launched which aims to produce sunglasses that block images from TV screens showing to a user. The IRL Glasses “put you in the driver’s seat” when it comes to public TV screens, and will provide users with uninterrupted experiences when worn. “IRL Glasses block LCD/LED screens through horizontal polarized optics,” states the Kickstarter page. “By flattening and rotating the polarized lens 90 degrees, light emitted by LCD/LED screens is blocked, making it look like the TV or computer in front of you is off.” The glasses have TAC 1.1, Cat 3, UV400 polarization, meaning they also work as a normal pair of UV-blocking sunglasses. You can back the project and receive a pair of IRL Glasses for $49. The glasses are set to ship in April 2019.
