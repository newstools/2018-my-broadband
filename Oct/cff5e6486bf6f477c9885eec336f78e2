Intel has issued an official denial to a report claiming that it has ended its 10-nanometer chip manufacturing process. SemiAccurate reported that Intel was cancelling the costly process citing “trusted moles”, but Intel issued its denial on Twitter. According to the report, Intel had been struggling to meet its own internal timelines for 10nm chips, and the proposed process would never be financially sustainable. Ars Technica explained that Intel has been experiencing trouble with its 10nm process. It highlighted Intel’s unusual Cannon Lake Core i3-8121U processor, which has its integrated graphics disabled because the chip giant couldn’t get the design of the built-in graphics accelerator working at 10nm. Rather than continuing its struggle with 10nm, the report stated that Intel would be skipping to a 7nm process. However, Intel issued a firm denial. This is atypical from the chip giant, which usually leaves rumours unacknowledged. “Media reports published today that Intel is ending work on the 10nm process are untrue. We are making good progress on 10nm. Yields are improving consistent with the timeline we shared during our last earnings report,” Intel said.
