Kathea is thrilled to introduce the breakthrough integration that positions the Polycom Trio as the collaboration hub of Polycom’s new modular smart conferencing solutions.  Marrying Polycom’s legendary voice quality with powerful video and content performance, the Polycom Trio is now able to easily transform conference rooms of all sizes- from huddle rooms to mid-size teaming spaces to large conference rooms – into collaborative, hassle-free team environments. In recent years, the Polycom Trio has been upgraded from a simple conference phone offering exceptional audio quality, into an integrated and cost-effective audio, content and video solution for small to medium-sized rooms.   Pairing the Polycom Trio with the new Polycom ViSual Pro – also known as the RealPresence Group Series – will allow you to make calls, share content, and perform all other meeting activities through the Trio, adding new features such as more camera options, dual monitors, the ability to use the Group Series system table and ceiling microphones, content sharing through HDMI or VGA, as well as sending video-based screen sharing content in Skype for Business environments.  “I see all too often how users tend to avoid video conferencing when it appears to be complicated or too difficult to use. What’s great about these new solutions is that they deliver one consistent and easy to use interface to every room so users don’t need to learn something new every time. Knowing how to quickly get a meeting started and feeling confident that the technology will perform every time will increase user adoption and ultimately drive success.” – Deepak Nathoo, Video Product Specialist, Kathea.
