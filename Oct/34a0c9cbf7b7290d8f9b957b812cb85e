Apple has acquired music analytics startup Asaii for less than $100 million, Axios has reported, citing sources and the LinkedIn profiles of founders Sony Theakanath and Austin Chen. The acquisition is aimed at helping Apple improve content recommendations to Apple Music subscribers, according to the report. It will also enable Apple to better compete with Spotify’s ability to work with smaller artists, the report stated. This is not the only music-related acquisition Apple has completed recently. Apple finalised its acquisition of Shazam in September, after announcing the deal in December last year. Apple’s deal with Shazam was reportedly worth $400 million. Following the acquisition, Apple announced that it would remove advertisements from the Shazam app, and that it would remain free to use.
