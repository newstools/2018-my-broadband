GitHub has published its latest State of the Octoverse report, looking at what developers have done over the past year. The report shows what the GitHub community has “accomplished on GitHub this year” and analyses trends in the software development industry. “You might notice a theme from Octoverse 2018: more collaboration across 1.1 billion contributions and more projects than ever before,” stated GitHub in the report. Part of the report focused on the most popular programming languages in the world, and how these have changed in recent years. “You’re coding on GitHub in hundreds of programming languages, but JavaScript still has the most contributors in public and private repositories, organisations of all sizes, and every region of the world,” said GitHub. TypeScript was a big gainer in 2018, it added, moving up to take seventh place in the top 10. “TypeScript is now in the top 10 most used languages across all regions GitHub contributors come from – and across private, public, and open source repositories.” The list and image below show the top languages, as detailed by the report.
