Telkom has announced that its new FreeMe prepaid bundles include free YouTube. Telkom FreeMe prepaid bundles include a number of bonuses, such as free calls, WhatsApp, messages, and more. The addition of free YouTube is the latest benefit offered by Telkom’s Summer of More promotion. Contract subscribers are still able to enjoy up to 200 hours or 50GB free data for YouTube streaming on the FreeMe 5GB and higher plans. “More than half of data used in South Africa is through the Telkom network,” said Telkom Consumer marketing executive Thami Majola. “This Summer of More responds to what South Africans are looking for, to be able to do more with their lives powered by affordable data”.
