A replica of the Titanic – Titanic II – that is to be built in China will make its first voyage in 2022, Fast Company reports. The $500-million ship is set to make its maiden voyage from Dubai to Southampton, and it will have room for 2,400 passengers and 900 crew members. The ship will also have the same decor and layout design as the original ocean liner. The Titanic II will then embark on global routes after the initial voyage, starting with the path of the original ship – travelling from Southampton to New York. Despite taking the same route, the replica will be safer than the original ocean liner by including enough lifeboats and a hull that’s welded rather than riveted. The original Titanic was built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast, Ireland, and sank on 15 April 1912 after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage. Plans for the replica ship were first revealed in April 2012 by Australian mining billionaire Clive Palmer, but it was previously expected to set sail late in 2016. Work on the project was halted following a dispute with a Chinese conglomerate in 2015. Technical specifications of the Titanic II are available in the video below.
