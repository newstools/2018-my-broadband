The Israel National Cyber Security Authority has sent out a nationwide security alert, warning users about a new method of hijacking WhatsApp accounts. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement that they have received several reports of private WhatsApp accounts being hacked. The method, which has been used to hijack many WhatsApp accounts already, uses the mobile providers’ voicemail systems. ZDNet reported that users who have voicemail accounts with default passwords – typically 0000 or 1234 – are at risk. The WhatsApp account takeover attack happens as follows: “Once the hacker has gained access to the WhatsApp account, he can enable two-step verification, which would prevent the legitimate owner from re-taking control over his WhatsApp account without a six-digit number only the attacker knows,” ZDNet explained. To prevent falling victim to this WhatsApp account hacking method, users are encouraged to change their voicemail passwords and enable WhatsApp’s two-step verification. Security researcher Martin Vigo demonstrated how a WhatsApp account can be hijacked via voicemail at DEF CON 26.
