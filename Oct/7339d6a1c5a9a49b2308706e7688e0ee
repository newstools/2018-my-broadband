Starting today, DStv is offering its customers free access to JOOX VIP â€“ an offer valued at R89.99 per month. This offer will be given to DStv Premium, Compact, and Compact Plus package holders and four of their family members. JOOX is a music streaming service that gives access to millions of music libraries and playlists, including local and international music. If you qualify for this free offer, the process to sign up is as follows. First, you must be signed up to JOOX, where you can use an existing account. Once signed up, you can then click on the DStv banner, or your profile image, then select JOOX VIP, and then DStv Customers. From here, you will be asked to enter your ID as the DStv account holder, then provide a one-time pin that will be sent to your associated number. You will then have access to JOOX VIP.
