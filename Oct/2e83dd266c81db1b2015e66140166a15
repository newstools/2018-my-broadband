Cybersmart recently announced an upgrade to its Lightspeed uncapped fibre service, offering speeds of up to 500Mbps for R899 per month. The ISP previously offered subscribers an uncapped 400Mbps service for R1,499 per month, but reduced the price to R899 and increased the speed to 500Mbps. It also cut the once-off price of its installation, activation, and fibre router from R3,999 to R1,499. Like all Cybersmart’s Lightspeed services, subscribers can change their download and upload speed ratio through an online portal in real-time. By default, the service is configured as a 250Mbps symmetrical service – 250Mbps download and 250Mbps upload – but this may be adjusted. Examples of available configurations include 450Mbps/50Mbps, and 500Mbps/10Mbps. Existing Lightspeed subscribers will be upgraded for free to the new 500Mbps product, with the option to trade in their old router and pay in R799 to receive an improved model. Cybersmart CTO Laurie Fialkov told MyBroadband that the Lightspeed fibre broadband service is available across most of the Atlantic seaboard, as well as Claremont, Mowbray, Swellendam, and Rosebank in Cape Town. It is also available at around 1,000 buildings around the country, Fialkov said. The company provides: It currently lists 425 locations around Gauteng, and 1,104 locations in the Western Cape with access to Cybersmart Lightspeed services.
