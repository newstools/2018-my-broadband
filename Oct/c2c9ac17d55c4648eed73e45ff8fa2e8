Cell C has announced that its free Black streaming data promotion has been extended to February 2019. “The free data is available on any of Cell C’s prepaid or contract plans including MediaPlay, which combines all your connectivity and entertainment needs on one monthly bill,” said Cell C. The free data promotion was set to end on 10 November 2018, following its launch in May. “We have however seen the need to extend it over the holiday period, especially when families and children have lots of dwell time.” “They can also subscribe to pay-as-you-go blockbuster movies with no fixed contracts to enjoy this free unlimited data promotion” said Surie Ramasary, Chief Executive of Black.
