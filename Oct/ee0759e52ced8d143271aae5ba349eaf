Jaguar has driven its electric SUV, the I-PACE, from Johannesburg to Durban using its Powerway charging network. The pre-production Jaguar I-PACE started the trip from Jaguar Centurion and travelled for 310km before stopping to recharge at a public 60kW fast charger in Bergview. “The Jaguar I-PACE’s battery was replenished to 100% capacity at the Jaguar Powerway fast charger in just enough time for its driver to enjoy breakfast and a rest,” said Jaguar. “The recharge was billed at roughly quarter the cost of full tanks of petrol or diesel in SUVs with similar power outputs.” The I-PACE then drove another 306km to reach Durban. The Jaguar Powerway recharging network, in partnership with GridCars, will feature 82 public charging stations for all electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids in the country’s major hubs and along frequently-travelled motorways between the country’s major cities, said Jaguar. The I-PACE is set to launch in Q1 2019.
