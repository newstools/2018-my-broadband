Microsoft has unveiled the “most powerful Surface Pro yet”, the Surface Pro 6. The versatile tablet, which can be used in “tablet, studio, or laptop” modes, packs an 8th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, SSD storage, and up to 16GB of RAM. “At more than 67% faster than the 5th-generation Surface Pro, we’ve redesigned Surface Pro 6 to pack in power but keep the portability, versatility, and all-day battery we know our fans love,” said Microsoft. The display is a 12.3-inch PixelSense touch unit with a resolution of 2,736 x 1,824, powered by Intel UHD Graphics 620. The device will go on sale in the US from 16 October 2018, starting at $899. It will be available in black and platinum colours.
