Codehesion has outperformed its competitors to win many new web and app development contracts from major South African companies. One of the main reasons for Codehesion’s excellent performance is its simple 4-step process to make it easy and risk-free for companies to start a successful software development process. The process involves an initial meeting, an internal workshop, a client workshop, and then an official proposal. “By following this 4-step process we are able to deliver a proposal to clients within a few days,” said Codehesion MD Hector Beyers. Beyers added that they use an agile development process to ensure successful and timely execution of their software projects. “To date we have had a 100% success rate with our software development projects, which shows that our processes work well,” said Beyers.
