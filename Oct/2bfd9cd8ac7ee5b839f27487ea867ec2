Intel has unveiled its new line-up of 9th-generation processors, including the first Core i9 chip aimed at mainstream desktop PC users. The new processors include support for Optane memory, Quick Sync streaming optimisation, and hardware-level security technology to protect customers’ systems and data. Included in the line-up is the Intel Core i9-9900K, which Intel calls the “world’s best gaming processor”. Intel revealed three new Core desktop processors, seven new Core X chips, and its new 28-core Xeon processor for high-end workstations. The company launched its new 9th-generation Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9 chips for mainstream gamers, each of which is unlocked and overclockable. Intel’s Turbo Boost 2.0 technology delivers up to 5.0GHz single-core frequency, which translates directly to more performance in modern games. The company also announced a new Z390 chipset for its 9th-gen processors, which includes Intel Wireless AC with support for Gigabit Wi-Fi speeds and integrated USB 3.1 Gen 2. The processors are also compatible with all 300-series Intel chipsets, added Intel. The new CPUs are built on a refined version of the manufacturer’s 14nm manufacturing process, which is the same process node used by its 6th, 7th, and 8th-gen chips. Intel’s seven new Core X processors are aimed at the high-end desktop platform and range from 8-core to 18-core chips with support for up to 68 PCIe lanes. Finally, Intel tops out its new processor range with the Xeon W-3175X 28-core processor. This high-end unlocked workstation CPU boasts 56 threads, 6-channel DDR4 memory support, and a boost clock speed of 4.3GHz.  Intel’s new mainstream Core chips are set to launch on 19 October 2018 and are currently available for pre-order from Evetech in South Africa. Intel’s Core X-series processors will be available in November, while its Xeon W-3175X CPU will ship in December. The specifications and pricing for Intel’s new desktop processors are below.
