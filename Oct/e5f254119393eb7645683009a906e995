Alaris Holdings has acquired US-based company mWave Industries. The company said final closing requirements for the deal concluded on 30 September 2018 and the acquisition took effect from 1 October 2018, forming part of the Alaris strategy to expand its footprint on a global level. Alaris Antennas, a subsidiary of Alaris Holdings, designs and manufactures specialised broadband antennas in addition to other radio frequency-related products. mWave Industries is a provider of commercial microwave antenna solutions based in Windham, Maine. The company’s brands include Mark Grid, Gabriel, mWave, and Quickfire antennas, which complement Alaris’s existing product lines. “The product lines complement one another and by joining forces, the companies will be able to provide an expanded product portfolio and improved service to customers, said Alarais Holdings Group CEO Juergen Dresel. “Being a client-centric organisation with clients based worldwide, the group’s strategy was to expand its global footprint in order to be closer to its clients. With the acquisition of mWave, this objective becomes a reality,“ Dresel said. He added that mWave Industries MD Peter Farnum would serve as part of the group’s management team going forward.
