GitHub has published its latest State of the Octoverse report, looking at trends in the software development industry. The report shows what the GitHub community has “accomplished on GitHub this year” and looks at aspects like popular programming languages. Along with a list of the 10 most popular programming languages in the world for 2018, GitHub ranked the fastest-growing languages. “We’re seeing trends toward more statically typed languages focused on thread safety and interoperability: Kotlin, TypeScript, and Rust are growing fast this year,” said GitHub. “In addition, the number of contributors writing HCL, a human readable language for DevOps, has more than doubled since 2017.” The image below show the languages with the biggest growth, based on growth in contributions in GitHub.
