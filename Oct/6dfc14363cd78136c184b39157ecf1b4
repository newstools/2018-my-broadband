Multiple warnings to Windows users not to download the latest update for Windows 10 were posted online in recent days. The Windows 10 October 2018 update is reportedly deleting users’ personal files after it is installed, and Microsoft has pulled the update from its download site. The company has also stopped pushing the update to users via automatic updates. “We have paused the rollout of the Windows 10 October 2018 Update (version 1809) for all users as we investigate isolated reports of users missing some files after updating,” said Microsoft. The update is reported to affect users’ files stored in the “Documents” folder. If your files are missing, you have been affected by the bug. If you are one of the affected users, Windows Insider head Dona Sarkar said you must contact Microsoft, reported Softpedia News. “If you’ve run into the missing files after update issue for 1809/October 2018 Fall update, please call our support line. They have the tools to get you back to a good state,” said Sarkar. The report further advised users not to move, add, or delete files on their hard drive if they have been affected by the issue. For more advanced users, data recovery tools can also be installed and used to get the files back.
