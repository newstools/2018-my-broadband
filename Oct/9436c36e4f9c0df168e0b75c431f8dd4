A US woman has filed a lawsuit against Facebook, stating that she sex trafficked when she was 15 after a pimp posed as a friend of a friend on Facebook, reported Reuters. The woman said she was friended by her attacker in 2012, and that he appeared to know several of her real-life friends. Following an argument with her mother, the alleged sex trafficker offered to comfort the woman. She said the pimp picked her up from her home, then beat and raped her, and took pictures. The woman’s claim against Facebook is that the man posed under a false identity, and that the platform did not do enough to verify that he was who he said he was. She also said she was never warned that sex traffickers were operating on Facebook. Representatives for Facebook and the plaintiff did not respond to requests for comment, Reuters reported.
