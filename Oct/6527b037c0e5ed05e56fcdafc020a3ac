Cape Town-based fibre ISP Atomic Access has launched new gigabit fibre packages on the Frogfoot and Octotel networks. The ISP’s 1Gbps packages are unshaped and uncapped, and are available from R1,399 per month. “These are the fastest home fibre lines available in South Africa today, with the lowest latency, yet very good value, even if you compare the pricing to what people pay for gigabit fibre in America,” said Atomic Access MD Nicholas Soper. “Atomic’s gigabit fibre is available from R1,399. You would pay around R1,200 for a similar service in the US. We finally have home Internet of comparable speed, price, and value,” he said. These package prices include a 20% discount which subscribers can enjoy if they invite others to join the ISP. Additionally, customers who order a gigabit fibre package before 30 October 2018 are eligible for free installation or migration. Atomic said its coverage is currently limited to the wider Cape Town area. Below are the uncapped, unshaped gigabit fibre packages available from Atomic Access.
