California governor Jerry Brown recently signed net neutrality legislation which was set to come into effect on 1 January. The move has now resulted in the United States Justice Department filing a suit against the state, Reuters reported. In December 2017, the FCC voted 3-2 to repeal its net neutrality rules, and the Justice Department has subsequently filed for a preliminary injunction to block California’s net neutrality laws. “States do not regulate interstate commerce – the federal government does. Once again the California legislature has enacted an extreme and illegal state law attempting to frustrate federal policy,” Jeff Sessions, US Attorney General, said. Sessions used the phrase “once again” as California and US President Donald Trump’s administration have clashed on environmental and immigration issues, the report stated. Sessions argued that companies can’t realistically comply with one set of standards in California, and another for the rest of the United States. However, the Attorney General for California, Xavier Becerra, said that the Trump administration was ignoring millions of Americans who supported net neutrality rules.
