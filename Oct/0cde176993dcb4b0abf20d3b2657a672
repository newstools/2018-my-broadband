As stores and shoppers gear up for Black Friday 2018, there may be a hurdle on the horizon. Black Friday 2018 will take place on 23 November this year, which is two days before South Africans typically receive their monthly pay cheques. Robyn Cooke, Head of TFG ecommerce, stated that this could giver Cyber Monday an edge, as it falls on 26 November – after people have been paid. Cyber Monday is the first Monday after Black Friday, and sees online stores offering big discounts in an attempt to get more customers to shop online. Cooke noted that during the sale weekend in 2017, 40% of total sales were checked out on the Friday, while 22% were on the Monday.
