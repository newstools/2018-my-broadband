Apple has unveiled its new Mac Mini at an event in New York. The new device has a Space Gray finish and features improved specifications compared to the previous model. Apple said the new Mac Mini will be powered by Intel 8th-generation processors, with either quad-core or hexa-core configurations. This upgrade makes the new Mac Mini up to five-times faster than the previous-generation device. Apple’s new Mac Mini sports a minimum of 8GB RAM which can be upgraded to up to 64GB of memory. Additionally, all new Mac Mini devices will feature solid state storage, with capacities ranging from 128GB to 2TB. “The new Mac Mini is a much faster, way more capable Mac desktop which allows you to choose your own desktop, keyboard, and monitor,” Apple said. The Mac Mini also includes Apple’s new T2 security chip, which offers HEVC video transcoding that is up to 30-times faster than previous Mac Mini products. Apple said the basic version of the Mac Mini will feature 8GB RAM, a 128GB SSD, and an Intel 8th-gen quad-core processor.
