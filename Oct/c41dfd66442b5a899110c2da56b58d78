SoundCloud has announced that its users can now share music to their Instagram Stories. This will allow users to share their music discoveries with others directly to their Instagram Stories from within the SoundCloud app interface. Artists can also include links to their own tracks on SoundCloud within their Stories, allowing listeners to access their content from Instagram. To make use of this sharing option, users can download the latest version of the SoundCloud app and select the “Share to Instagram Stories” option underneath a track of their choice. The new feature has begun rolling out to users worldwide, and is available via the latest versions of the SoundCloud and Instagram mobile apps on iOS and Android.
