Openserve fibre technicians in Bishop Lavis, Cape Town have been chased away from repairing a fibre line in the area. The company stated that on Friday, restoration of a “major optic fibre route” came to a stop when technicians and their security escorts had to leave the Olyfberg Road area. “Technicians had started assessing the extent of damage to the fibre route when they were confronted by a group of people, presumed to be from the local community, and forced out of the area,” said Openserve. Openserve said it reported the matter to the police, who recommended that technicians stay away this weekend. “Police will assess if it is safe for work to continue on Monday and will be on patrol while technicians work to restore the damaged fibre cabling.” Openserve said the repair would be completed by Thursday if work commences on Monday, and apologised to clients affected by the fibre break. In a separate incident, News24 reported on Friday that two men had been killed in a shooting in Bishop Lavis. This news follows an incident in August where Vumatel stopped work in KwaZulu-Natal due to intimidation and threats against workers. “Due to incidents of intimidation and threats made by various groups in KwaZulu-Natal, it is not safe or practical for the contractors to continue working in the field at the moment” Vumatel told clients at the time.
