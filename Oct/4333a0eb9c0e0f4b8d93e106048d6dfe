Google has announced that it has improved on its real-time ETA sharing for Google Maps on Android, and is now bringing the feature to iOS. The feature lets you share your ETA with your friends and loved ones while driving, letting you focus on the road and keeping them updated on your journey. It has been available on Android for more than a year now, but the feature is finally set to roll out to iOS users. Google also said that today’s update allows users to share their location live across third-party apps, such as Facebook Messenger, Line, and WhatsApp – a feature which is also new to Android. To enable the feature, you must tap on the “up arrow” button and then on “Share trip progress”, after you have started navigating to a destination on the app. You can download the update for the app now via the Play Store or the App Store.
