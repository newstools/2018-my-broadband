ICASA has released its latest report on cellular tariffs in South Africa. The report, which measures mobile services between 2 January and 30 June 2018, looks at how prices have changed in the market and how this impacts consumers. “The Authority received 134 tariff notifications, inclusive of promotions, during the period under review,” said ICASA. “The purpose of the report is to highlight the different tariff plans which were filed and/or existed in the market during the period under review.” “The headline standard voice prepaid tariffs for Vodacom and MTN have increased by 2.5% and 25.3%, respectively. The changes were mainly due to commercial reasons and the 1 percentage point VAT increase,” said ICASA. ICASA then looked at flat-rate tariffs on a per-second basis. “All flat-rate tariffs are charged on a per second basis, meaning that subscribers only pay for the duration of the call.” This included the tariffs of Vodacom, MTN, and Cell C. It noted that Telkom does not offer a flat-rate tariff plan. The graphic below shows the cheapest flat rate per-second billing plans for the three networks.  The table below shows how much a subscriber will pay depending on the duration of their call.  ICASA also looked at the differences between on-net and any-network calls. On-net calls refer to calls by a subscriber to another user on the same network. For example, a Vodacom user calls another Vodacom user. Any-network calls refer to a user calling a subscriber on another network – a Vodacom user calling an MTN subscriber. “Vodacom, MTN and Telkom offered on-net focused tariffs. Vodacom offered the Daily Free Calls plan, MTN offered the Talk Free plan and Telkom offered the Sim Sonke plan,” said ICASA. The table below shows the on-net focused tariffs of the networks.
