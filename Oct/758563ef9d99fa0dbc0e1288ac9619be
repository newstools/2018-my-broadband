Gartner has released its worldwide PC shipment estimates for Q3 2018. The report shows that Lenovo is at the top, with 15.8 million units shipped and 23.6% market share. “Worldwide PC shipments totaled 67.2 million units in the third quarter of 2018, a 0.1% increase from the third quarter of 2017,” said Gartner. “The PC market continued to be driven by steady corporate PC demand, which was driven by Windows 10 PC hardware upgrades. We expect the Windows 10 upgrade cycle to continue through 2020 at which point the upgrade demand will diminish.” The report added that an Intel CPU shortage could influence the PC market moving forward with “price increases and changes to the vendor landscape”.
