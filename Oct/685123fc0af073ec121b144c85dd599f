South African-based blockchain startup Tari Labs has launched a free online university to aid open-source blockchain projects and train developers. Tari Labs is a contributor to the open-source Tari blockchain protocol and is cofounded by cryptocurrency expert Riccardo Spagni. The Tari Labs development team is based in Johannesburg, and the university project aims to provide potential candidates with the training required to develop blockchain protocols. “Tari Labs University aims to become a go-to destination for easily-accessible learning material for blockchain, digital currency, and digital assets, from beginner to advanced level,” said Tari Labs senior contributor Cayle Sharrock. “The more blockchain experts we can help develop, the better it is for the ecosystem as a whole.” He added that the university would also allow for developers to learn and operate in an ecosystem which leverages the Tari blockchain protocol. “We’re ultimately part of a network, and the more participants it has, the more successful it will be.” Tari Labs University courses, resources, and learning material are available on GitHub.
