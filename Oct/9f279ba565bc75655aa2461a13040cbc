Razer has unveiled its first gaming router, the Razer Sila. The router is aimed at the gaming market and includes a number of features designed to improve connection reliability and speed. One of the most prominent features is the Razer FasTrack engine, which allows users to prioritise bandwidth when too many applications or devices are in use. The router also includes a dedicated gaming mode to provide improved reliability while playing online. Gamers can prioritise gaming traffic from devices including their PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. Two or more Razer Sila routers can also function as a hybrid wireless mesh network, allowing you to automatically switch connections between hardware depending on your location relative to the routers. The Razer Sila is a tri-band router with 2.4GHz and 5GHz channels, and includes nine internal industrial-grade antennas with MU-MIMO and beamforming technology enabled. Razer Sila owners can also manage their network using the dedicated mobile app for Android and iOS. Razerâ€™s Sila gaming router is available for purchase from the Razer online store for $250.
