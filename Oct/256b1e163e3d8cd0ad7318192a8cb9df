The Financial Times reports that Apple is investigating claims that a supplier was employing students illegally to create Apple Watches. Sacom, a human rights group from Hong Kong, claims that Taiwanese supplier Quanta Computer has been employing students illegally in the Chinese city of Chongqing. 28 students outlined how they allegedly went to the factory as interns, but were used as assembly line workers – including overtime and night shifts. Both of these are illegal for student interns in China. One student claimed that around 120 students worked on one of the floors, while 11 students claimed they were informed they had to complete the internships if they hoped to graduate on time. “We are urgently investigating the report that student interns added in September are working overtime and night shifts,” said an Apple spokesperson. “We have zero tolerance for failure to comply with our standards and we ensure swift action and appropriate remediation if we discover violations.”
