Samsung recently invited select customers to its “2018 Samsung OLED Forum” at the Shenzhen Marriott Hotel in China, where it revealed plans for its 2019 mobile phone design, SlashGear reported – citing a post on Twitter by a user known as Ice Universe. One of the slides from the event leaked, showing four different types of sensor technology that Samsung Display highlighted at the event. This included the long-awaited “Fingerprint on Display” technology, “Haptic on Display” that is expected to be similar to Apple’s pressure-sensitive Force Touch technology, and “Sound on Display” technology. SlashGear speculates that Sound on Display could be similar to the work Xiaomi and Vivo have done with piezoelectric motors on their devices. In addition, the slide also showed a quadrant for an “Under Panel Sensor”. Ice Universe explained that this would include camera technology. XDA Developers pointed out that the combination of these technologies means that Samsung would be able to deliver a full-face screen on a smartphone, without the need for a notch at the top of the device to place the front-facing camera and the receiver.
