Google announced that it is discontinuing support for Android’s Nearby Notifications feature. Nearby Notifications was created to allow users to discover apps and content based on nearby events, but the number of spam notifications has increased drastically this year. “Our goal was to bring relevant and engaging content to users – to provide useful information proactively,” Google said. “However, earlier this year, we noticed a significant increase in locally irrelevant and spammy notifications that were leading to a poor user experience.” Google will stop serving Android Nearby Notifications on 6 December 2018, after which users will stop receiving them altogether. Developers will still be able to deliver proximity-based notifications through their third-party apps using the company’s Proximity Beacons API.
