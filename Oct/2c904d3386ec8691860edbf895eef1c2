Have I Been Pwned has released information on a massive new data leak. The data leak stems from sales engagement startup Apollo, which left a database containing billions of data points publicly exposed without a password in July 2018, stated the site. “The data was discovered by security researcher Vinny Troia, who subsequently sent a subset of the data containing 126 million unique email addresses to Have I Been Pwned.” The data left exposed by Apollo was used in their “revenue acceleration platform” and included information such as names and email addresses – as well as professional information including places of employment, the roles people hold, and where they are located, said Have I Been Pwned. “Apollo stressed that the exposed data did not include sensitive information such as passwords, social security numbers, or financial data.” To see if you have been compromised, visit Have I Been Pwned and enter your email address.
