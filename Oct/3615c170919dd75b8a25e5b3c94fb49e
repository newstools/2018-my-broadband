Instagram has rolled out a new security feature to all users which adds a non-SMS-based two-factor authentication method, TechCrunch reports. While the app previously required users to authenticate their login attempts via text message, users can now choose to use an authentication app to approve their logins. To enable two-factor authentication on Instagram, users can open the app and navigate to Settings > Privacy and Security > Two-Factor Authentication. From this menu, users can select the Authentication App method to link an app such as Google Authenticator or Authy. If you do not have an authentication app installed, Instagram will automatically invite you to download one.
