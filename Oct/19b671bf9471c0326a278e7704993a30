Whether you are completely new to the world of DIY electronics or an experienced hacker, a Raspberry Pi is one of the best purchases you can make. Thanks to its open-source code base, highly-populated hardware ecosystem, and interoperability with a variety of other devices, the Raspberry Pi is an essential tool for many projects. Raspberry Pi microcomputers come in a variety of configurations, from the small but feature-packed Raspberry Pi Zero W to the larger and more powerful Raspberry Pi 3. We received a Raspberry Pi 3 Premium Kit from RS Components, which is one of the best starter packages on the market for those looking to start out with DIY hacking projects. The Raspberry Pi 3 Premium Kit includes everything you need to set up and get started with using the Raspberry Pi. The bundle comprises high-quality parts which are certified to be compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ included in the box. Below is the full list of hardware included in the Raspberry Pi 3 Premium Kit: The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ can be used for a variety of applications thanks to its impressive hardware capabilities, offering value far above its price tag. Below are the specifications of the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ board. Once you have your Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ set up with its case, power supply, and peripherals, you will need to take on a project. Thankfully, there are an endless list of applications for the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, a good number of which can be completed without any external hardware. For example, you could simply connect a USB microphone and 3.5mm audio speaker to the respective ports on the Pi and have the hardware required to build your own Amazon Echo or Google Home. An even easier application for the board is to connect it to a Wi-Fi connection and speaker, setting it up to be compatible with Spotify Connect and function as a speaker for the music streaming platform. A Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ can also be used as a dedicated cryptocurrency wallet to safely store your digital investments, or it can be turned into a gaming console for streaming games from your PC to your TV. If you are a more experienced user, you can even try to build NASAâ€™s Mars rover robotic model, which is powered by a Raspberry Pi. The possibilities really are endless, and the wide variety of tutorials and projects available from the Raspberry Pi website and elsewhere on the Internet mean you will never run out of ideas.
