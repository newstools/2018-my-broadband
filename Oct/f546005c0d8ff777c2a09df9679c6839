Gated communities, estates, and business parks in South Africa are taking a “hard line” against fibre infrastructure players which do not offer open access networks. This is according to ISPA, which stated that people are increasingly insisting on open-access fibre installations. Open-access networks allow multiple ISPs to operate on their infrastructure. “There’s a clear trend towards homeowners’ associations, body corporates, residents’ associations, and property developers rejecting any potential fibre installation that does not allow for multiple Internet service providers to compete for owners’ and tenants’ business,” said Graham Beneke, ISPA chair. “They are doing this because they recognise that open access fibre networks provide the best of high-quality, affordable connectivity for consumers while increasing the value of property in the estate or community”. ISPA added that not all networks want to “provide a platform for competition”, however. “ISPA’s view is that this is not in the best interests of consumers and needs to be addressed to reduce the cost to communicate, poor service levels, and a lack of innovation.”
