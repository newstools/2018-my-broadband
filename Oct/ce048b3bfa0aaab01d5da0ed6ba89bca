Amazon has begun rolling out Whisper Mode for its Alexa digital assistant, The Verge reports. Using this new feature, users can whisper questions to their Amazon Echo device and Alexa will whisper a response that is far quieter than normal. The feature was announced last month and forms part of Amazon’s efforts to make its Alexa assistant sound more human-like. Whisper Mode is reportedly powered by the same technology behind Alexa Guard, which recognises smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass breaking, turning Alexa into a home security system. Alexa’s Whisper mode is currently only available in English to users in the United States. Alexa's new whisper mode is clever but also kinda super creepy??? pic.twitter.com/N6IM1mQoee — dan seifert (@dcseifert) October 18, 2018
