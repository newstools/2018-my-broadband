Chinese brand Nubia has unveiled its Nubia X smartphone, which sports a true full screen front display. The company achieved this by leaving out a front-facing camera and placing two cameras on the rear of the device for selfies. The Nubia X also features a 5.1-inch OLED display on its rear, so users can see what they are doing when pointing the cameras at themselves. This is in combination with its 6.26-inch FHD+ LCD screen on the front. Nubia has placed 16MP f/1.8 and 24MP f/1.7 sensors on the back, and users can also use the OLED display on the rear to show live wallpapers or a clock face. Inside the smartphone you will find a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845, up to 8GB of RAM, up to 256GB of storage – without a microSD slot – and a 3,800mAh battery. This all runs Android 8.1. The device is on sale in China for 3,299 yuan ($470) – with 6GB RAM and 64GB storage.
