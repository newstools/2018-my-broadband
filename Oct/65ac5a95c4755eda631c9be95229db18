YouTube viewers can now watch videos using a picture-in-picture mini player in their web browser, The Verge reports. The mini player feature was rolled out to the YouTube mobile app earlier this month, and is now available in the platform’s browser interface. Users can choose to watch videos in the picture-in-picture mode by selecting the mini player option in the bottom-right corner of the video. The mini player viewing mode allows users to continue browsing YouTube in the same browser tab while their video plays in the corner of their browser window. To exit the mini player, users click the “X” button on the picture-in-picture video or press the Escape key.
