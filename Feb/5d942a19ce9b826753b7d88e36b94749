WhatsApp has reached 1.5 billion monthly active users, according to Facebook’s Q4 2017 earnings report. The platform now sees users sending over 60 billion messages per day. “A growing number of these messages are between people and companies, which is why we launched WhatsApp Business – a new app designed specifically for small and medium businesses to connect with people they want to reach,” said Zuckerberg. This is a large increase compared to the 1.3 billion monthly active users WhatsApp had in July 2017. Zuckerberg added that WhatsApp and Instagram are the most popular story-sharing products in the world, each having 300 million daily users.
