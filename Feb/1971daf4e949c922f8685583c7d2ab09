Many government and other websites were hijacked to mine the cryptocurrency Monero on Sunday. The Register highlighted that the affected websites used the plugin Browsealoud, which is produced by Texthelp Limited. The Browsealoud plugin adds speech, reading, and translation functions to websites. Texthelp said a JavaScript file which is part of the Browsealoud product was compromised during a cyberattack. “The attacker added malicious code to the file to use the browser CPU in an attempt to illegally generate cryptocurrency,” said Texthelp. Texthelp CTO Martin McKay said its automated security tests for Browsealoud detected the modified file, and as a result the product was taken offline. “This removed Browsealoud from all our customer sites immediately, addressing the security risk,” he said. The company added that no customer data has been accessed or lost, and that the exploit was active for a period of four hours.
