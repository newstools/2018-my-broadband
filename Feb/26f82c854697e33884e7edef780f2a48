Africa Data Centres, a Liquid Telecom subsidiary, has launched newly-expanded data centres facilities in Johannesburg and Cape Town. The South Africa Data Centre (SADC) is carrier-neutral, built to Tier III standards, and offers open access facilities in both Johannesburg and Cape Town. Expanded from the data centres acquired as part of Liquid Telecomâ€™s R6.55-billion deal for Neotel, the total floor space has been upgraded to 3,000 square metres in Johannesburg and to 1,800 square metres in Cape Town. The completion of the first phase of expansion now sees SADC Johannesburg offer a total power capacity of 7MW, while SADC Cape Town provides 5.5MW of power. Both data centres are already home to nearly 100 customers, including global, regional, and local telecoms operators, ISPs, cloud service providers, and large enterprises. The facilities are connected by the fibre routes of many major carriers and also host internet exchanges independently operated by INX-ZA, enabling connected members in any site to peer quickly and cost-effectively with members in other data centres. Photographs of the new Johannesburg and Cape Town facilities, which were officially opened on 30 January, are below.       This article was published in partnership with Liquid Telecom.
