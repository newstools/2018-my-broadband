Apple has revealed its reason from removing Telegram and Telegram X from its App Store – reports of child pornography being shared in the app. VentureBeat reported that Telegram was taken down after Apple was alerted to the illegal content. Apple’s head of global marketing, Phil Schiller, said after verifying the existence of the illegal content, the developer was alerted and the authorities notified. Schiller said Apple will not allow illegal content to be distributed by apps in the App Store. “The App Store team worked with the developer to have them remove this illegal content from the apps and ban the users who posted this horrible content,” said Schiller. New controls were then put in place by Telegram, and Apple reinstated its apps on the App Store.
