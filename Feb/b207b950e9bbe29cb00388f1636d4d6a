HMD Global’s “pure, secure, and always up-to-date” Android promise has received an endorsement from Google, with new Nokia devices now in the Android One programme. New Nokia Android smartphones from the Nokia 3 and up will join the Android One programme, starting with the second-generation Nokia 6. The company’s already-launched devices, including the first-generation Nokia 6, will not join Android One. Google’s Android One programme identifies high-quality, affordable components that can go into next-generation smartphones and makes it easier for manufacturers to build a device. It also places restrictions on the software a device may run, which includes: The second-generation Nokia 6 retains its 5.5-inch polarised display, but moves the fingerprint reader to the back of the device. It has also received dual cameras with Zeiss optics and Nokia’s “bothie” feature, which lets you simultaneously capture photos or video from the front and rear cameras. HMD Global has also integrated Nokia 360 spatial audio capture and playback technology into the second-generation Nokia 6, along with new hardware. Performance of the new Nokia 6 is up to 60% higher compared to the first generation, thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 platform. It also comes with 3GB RAM, and Fast Charge via a USB Type-C connector. The new Nokia 6 will launch in black with copper detailing, white with iron detailing, and blue with gold detailing. The device will be available from April 2018 for around €279.
