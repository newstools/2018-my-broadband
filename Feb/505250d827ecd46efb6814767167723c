Apple has seeded a new beta version of iOS 11.3 to developers, which includes the new battery health feature. “We’re going to give people the visibility of the health of their battery so it’s very, very transparent. This hasn’t been done before,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook. The next update to iOS 11 will also let users disable battery-linked CPU throttling, which Apple introduced in iOS 10.2.1. “iOS dynamically manages the maximum performance of some system components when needed to prevent a shutdown. In some cases, users may experience longer launch times for apps and other reductions in performance.” Apple’s battery-linked CPU throttling affects the iPhone 6 and newer smartphones. Screenshots of the new battery health feature are posted below.
