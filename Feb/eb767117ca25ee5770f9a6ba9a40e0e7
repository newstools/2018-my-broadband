Compulab has launched a Kickstarter campaign for its fanless mini gaming PC, the Airtop2 Inferno. The PC is cooled by passive heat sinks, meaning it makes no noise when gaming. The Airtop2 Inferno boasts impressive specifications, packing an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 and Intel Core i7-7700K into an 11-litre chassis. Users can also remove and replace components, such as the graphics card, memory, and storage drives. The PC includes space for six storage drives and sports an integrated OLED display, which shows temperature, power, and system information. Customers can back the project on Kickstarter until 25 March 2018, and the full PC will start shipping in June 2018. Backing for a barebone model starts at $1,599.
