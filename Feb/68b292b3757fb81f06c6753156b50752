Toyota has unveiled the new Yaris. The car is slightly larger than the previous model – 165mm lengthways and 5mm in width – and offers more interior room, said Toyota. The exterior has also received a facelift, with updated headlights and grille part of the new package. Toyota said the increase in size and new design produces a “profile reminiscent of its larger sibling, the Auris”. Power delivery is taken care of by a 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine, utilising dual VVT-i and a DOHC 16-valve layout. “The engine delivers a rev-happy 79kW and 140Nm. A singular engine option is carried across the range,” said Toyota. Top speed for the manual models is 180km/h, with the CVT model is geared for 170km/h. Fuel consumption is listed as 5.9 litres and 5.8 litres per 100 kilometres, for the manual and CVT respectively. The new Yaris models on offer are detailed below: All Yaris models come with a 3-year/45,000km service plan and 3-year/100,000km warranty. Service intervals are set at 15,000 kilometres.
