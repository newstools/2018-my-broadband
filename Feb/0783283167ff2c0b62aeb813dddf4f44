Gauteng Premier David Makhura has asked South African-born Elon Musk to extend a helping hand to South Africa. Makhura was honouring local technology entrepreneurs during his State of the Province address when he made the remark. After mentioning the entrepreneurs and their companies, Makhura congratulated Elon Musk on the launch of the first of nearly 12,000 Starlink satellites – which will offer Internet access around the world. Musk has stated that the satellite network’s name was inspired by The Fault In Our Stars, a book by John Green. “Elon is very proud of his link with our country, our province, and our capital city, Tshwane,” said Makhura. “Elon, please lend a hand in linking our economy to some of the world’s best innovation ecosystems so that we are not left behind.”
