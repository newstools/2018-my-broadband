Nuance has discontinued support for its Swype keyboard software, The Verge reported. The app’s predictive swiping keyboard feature is built into most Android smartphones, and Nuance has opted to focus on other AI-powered solutions instead of the keyboard’s development. “The core technology behind Swype will continue to be utilised and improved upon across other Nuance offerings, and integrated into our broader AI-powered solutions – most notably in Android-based keyboard solutions for our automotive customers,” Nuance told The Verge. Swype is no longer available on the iOS App Store or Google Play, but customers who have the application can still use it normally.
