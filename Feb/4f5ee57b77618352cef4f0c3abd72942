Duxbury Networking’s sales increased by 19.8% in 2017, thanks to a strong performance in Netgear wired and wireless networking devices and Cambium wireless fabric technology solutions. This is according to Duxbury Networking CEO Graham Duxbury, who said their wireless offerings featured strongly in the company’s sales last year. In addition to Netgear and Cambium products, the Rajant brand – with its Kinetic Mesh technology designed to provide mobile wireless broadband connectivity – was another strong performer. In Duxbury Networking’s security segment, Sophos, with products for encryption, network security, email security, mobile security, and unified threat management, was the standout performer. The company has a simple philosophy to ensure continued growth in 2018: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. “Our recipe for success in the South African distribution channel has been proven over the last three decades. We’re not going to divert from this formula,” said Duxbury. He said they are not sitting back, however, and hoping for continued demand to drive growth for the company. In addition to organic growth in 2018, Duxbury expects significant gains from a number of large projects which will be finalised early in 2018 – and spur growth from the second quarter of the year. Duxbury Networking’s dealers, resellers, and customers can also look forward to continued product developments and releases from its suppliers this year, he added.
