Online Ethereum wallet provider MyEtherWallet has changed its name to MyCrypto. The online wallet has become one of the most popular ways to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and its contributors have worked to keep up with the skyrocketing demand. In a Medium post, MyEtherWallet founder Taylor Monahan said the MyEtherWallet project has evolved into a full-time product, company, and team which warrants a rebranding and a new beginning. “MyEtherWallet LLC was sufficient for the early stages of growth,” said Monahan. “MyCrypto is designed with next-level scaling in mind from the beginning.” “The team I have assembled over the past nine months and I will now be be building, providing support, educating, and ensuring the security of https://mycrypto.com and all future products,” she said. The MyEtherWallet codebase has been overhauled and rewritten for the new MyCrypto platform, and the MyEtherWallet domain will continue to function normally for the time being.
