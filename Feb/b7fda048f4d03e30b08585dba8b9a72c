Photos reportedly of the 6.5-inch “iPhone X Plus” have been posted on the Chinese-language MacX forums. The first photo shows a digitiser, with the overall size appearing larger than the original iPhone X. MacRumors also noted the part number on the flex cable attached to the bottom of the digitiser, which is similar to the format Apple uses. According to the report, Apple is set to launch three new iPhones this year. They are expected to be a second-generation iPhone X, the 6.5-inch iPhone X Plus, and a new 6.1-inch LCD iPhone. Apple typically announces its new iPhones around September.
