MultiChoice has announced the switch-off of its analogue broadcast service for M-Net. It will take place at the end of March, and subscribers will be migrated to its new digital terrestrial TV network. M-Net’s analogue switch-off will happen over a year ahead of South Africa’s latest digital migration deadline – June 2019. “Depending on what services you currently have, we’ll be making you an offer to assist you to migrate,” said MultiChoice. “This could include paying for a DStv-accredited installer to come out to your home,” it said. A relevant digital decoder and equipment will be needed to do the installation, it added. Certain M-Net analogue customers already have a DStv set-up, while others only have their M-Net analogue connection, which is why subscribers must contact MultiChoice, it said. MultiChoice will then provide the offer that applies to the customer. “If you get migrated and want to stay with your M-Net service, you’ll get a special M-Net GO package at the same price as you are paying, with the same channels. Except you get a much better viewing experience – you’ll have clearer picture and sharper sound quality,” said MultiChoice. “You’ll also, for the first time, get access to the electronic programme guide so you can see what is currently showing and what is up next.” MultiChoice recently announced it will increase the price of its standalone M-Net GO service from R389 t0 R409 per month.
