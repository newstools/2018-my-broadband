University of Colorado Boulder researchers have developed a new type of malleable, self-healing and fully recyclable electronic skin. This electronic skin has applications ranging from robotics and prosthetic development, to better biomedical devices. Electronic skin, or e-skin, is a thin, translucent material that can mimic the function and mechanical properties of human skin. A number of different types and sizes of wearable e-skins are now being developed in labs around the world as researchers recognise their value in the medical, scientific and engineering fields. CU Boulder’s e-skin has sensors embedded to measure pressure, temperature, humidity and air flow. Its technology has several distinctive properties, including a type of covalently bonded dynamic network polymer, known as polyimine. The polyimine has been laced with silver nanoparticles to provide better mechanical strength, chemical stability and electrical conductivity.
