Telegram has launched a login widget for websites aimed at enabling communication between businesses and users. “When you use Telegram login for the first time, our widget asks for your phone number and sends you a confirmation message via Telegram to authorise your browser,” said Telegram. “Once this is done, you get a two-click login on every website that supports signing in with Telegram.” Logging in will send your Telegram name, username, and your profile picture to the website owner. Your phone number remains hidden. The website can also request permission to send you messages. After each login, Telegram said it will send you a summary message about the permissions you have granted and the data you’ve passed to the website owner. You can revoke the authorisation by tapping the appropriate button under the login summary. The company said this login tool is the first phase of the Telegram ID project, which it will roll out during 2018.
