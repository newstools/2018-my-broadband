The Gautrain has launched a new website and mobile application aimed at improving the experience of passengers. The new website and app allow users to register and receive relevant travel information. “Passengers can now manage their Gautrain cards, trip planning, and refund claims online,” said Gauteng MEC for Roads and Transport Ismail Vadi.” “They will be able to register their cards, reload funds, buy Gautrain travel products passes, purchase bulk cards, view their card transaction history, check their card expiry dates, and plan their real-time trips.” The platforms also include a trip-planning tool, which helps passengers to plan their route. Gautrain passengers will still be able to purchase cards at any Gautrain station.
