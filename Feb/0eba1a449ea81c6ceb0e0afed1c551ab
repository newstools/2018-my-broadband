Exmile Technologies has purchased GConnect, based on an approved business rescue plan. The WirelessG management team, trading under the brand GConnect, previously made an offer to buy the business in September 2017. Following the purchase of the going concern of WirelessG from its creditors, GConnect is now owned by Exmile Technologies. GConnect offers Wi-Fi hotspot services to businesses and wholesale Wi-Fi services to ISPs, and has installed Wi-Fi services for multiple major brands. GConnect also has a current network footprint of over 600 Wi-Fi hotspots across South Africa. “The company and its employees are extremely thrilled that the acquisition is now finalised, so that we can continue to focus on what is important to us – to provide a reliable managed Wi-Fi service that our customers can trust,” said Exmile Technologies CEO Jan van der Nest. “One of our key objectives as a company is to increase our Wi-Fi hotspot footprint rapidly over the next couple of years,” he said. The company has also completed the development of its Social Wi-Fi and Analytics software, where Wi-Fi hotspot customers can engage with consumers who have used their Wi-Fi service. Exmile is owned by its management team, which includes Van der Nest, CTO Henk Badenhorst, COO Braam Linde, and CFO Hazel Badenhorst.
