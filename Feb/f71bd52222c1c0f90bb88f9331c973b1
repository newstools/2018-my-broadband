SpaceX has delayed the launch of its next Falcon 9 rocket to 21 February 2018. The rocket was originally scheduled to launch on 18 February, but it has been delayed to allow for final checks of the craft’s payload fairing. The launch will send SpaceX’s first Starlink broadband satellites into orbit, along with a radar-imaging satellite for Spain’s Ministry of Defense. SpaceX is using a refurbished first-stage booster to deliver the payload to orbit, after which it will discard the booster into the ocean.
