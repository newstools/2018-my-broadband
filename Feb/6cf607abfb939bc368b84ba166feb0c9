A patent filing by Lenovo suggests the company is looking at blockchain technology to validate physical documents. The application outlines a blockchain architecture which verifies the authenticity of physical documents by creating a digital map of the document, signed with a digital signature. “Using the security blockchain, anyone can validate that they have the current authentic physical document, even if multiple paper copies exist and multiple people have made entries in the chain of modification,” said Lenovo. “If any forgeries exist, they will show up as orphaned blocks in the chain.”
