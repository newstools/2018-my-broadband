Online payment processing business Stripe will open an engineering centre in Ireland, TechCrunch reported. The company has signed a lease for a building in Dublin, which will operate as its first engineering hub outside the US. Stripe’s European headquarters are also in Dublin, and the office is home to over 100 employees. Stripe CEO Patrick Collison said that while the uncertainty over Brexit was not the main reason for its new engineering centre going to Dublin, it was certainly an influencing factor. The company said it chose Dublin due to its “globally-minded” and “outward-looking” approach to business.
