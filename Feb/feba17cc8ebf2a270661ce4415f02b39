Telkom has successfully concluded “Africa’s first demonstration” of 2.3GHz LTE TDD Massive MIMO. “This technology represents the next step in Telkom’s continuing network evolution,” said the company. Telkom said Massive MIMO will enable Telkom’s customers to experience data speeds five-times faster than 4G technology allows. “This will result in better throughput speeds and improved coverage, leading to a better overall experience for consumers.” The demonstration was based on 2.3GHz TDD 20MHz bandwidth on Telkom’s network, it said. “The demo, conducted by Huawei, reached 909Mbps at peak rate, showing improved spectrum efficiency and network coverage.” Massive MIMO technology will also enable Telkom to reuse existing sites to meet high data demand, rather than acquiring and building new sites in dense areas, it said. Telkom said it has already deployed LTE, LTE-A, and 4-by-4 MIMO technology on its network.
