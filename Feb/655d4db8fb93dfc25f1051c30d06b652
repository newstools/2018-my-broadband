MTN has seen a 29% increase in 3G data volumes and a 123% increase in 4G data volumes over the past year, while maintaining a consistent increase in throughput. This is according to Zoltan Miklos, the engineering GM at MTN South Africa, who was speaking at the MyBroadband Underground Mobile Networking conference. Miklos said that while he could not reveal MTN’s latest stats for average mobile data traffic per month, as an industry they are seeing growth inline with Cisco’s predictions of a 60% compound annual growth in mobile data traffic. He did detail the traffic mix on MTN’s network, however, showing how subscribers use their data. The majority of mobile data is spent on streaming media (31%), social media (25%), and browsing (23%), as illustrated in the chart below.
