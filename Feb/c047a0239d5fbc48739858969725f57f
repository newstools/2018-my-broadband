The African National Congress (ANC) has announced the recall President Jacob Zuma. Secretary General of the ANC, Ace Magashule, announced the recall, saying that the National Executive Committee of the party came to the decision after extensive discussions. Magashule said that the NEC and Zuma couldn’t agree on the timeframes for him to step down. Zuma requested a minimum of three months, while the ANC wanted the transition to happen sooner. “We did not take this decision because he did anything wrong,” said Magashule. “President Zuma has not been found guilty of anything in a court of law.” No deadline has been set by which Zuma must resign, but Magashule said that they expect President Zuma to respond tomorrow. On the issue of whether the ANC believes Zuma will resign, Magashule said that when the organisation recalls its deployee, it expects them to respond accordingly. Magashule also revealed that the NEC believes that Cyril Ramaphosa must take over the Presidency of the country.
