SpaceX launched one of its Falcon 9 rockets yesterday, placing the first of its Starlink broadband satellites into orbit. While the company did not plan to recover the Falcon 9 booster, it did attempt to recover the payload fairing for the first time. The payload fairing is a nose cone which protects the rocketâ€™s payload from aerodynamic forces and heat, which detaches once the craft has left the atmosphere. SpaceX planned to recover the fairing by catching it in a giant net attached to a ship. The fairing was outfitted with directional thrusters and parafoils, which piloted it back. Elon Musk stated that the fairing landed a few hundred metres away from the ship, and the addition of larger parafoils to slow its descent should allow the ship to catch the fairing in future.
