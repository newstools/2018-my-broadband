OneDayOnly, the popular online store for bargain hunters in South Africa, has big plans to grow its presence in 2018. The company doubled its revenue in 2017 and needed to move warehouses in Cape Town and Johannesburg to accommodate its rapid expansion. It is not slowing down in 2018, and is building on its success by partnering with more popular brands and growing its product range. The company said it will continue to offer big brand items from Puma, Smeg, Asics, Samsung, Bosch, Garmin, and Lego at “unbeatable prices” in 2018. Consumers can also expect to see regular tech and gadget deals, which remain popular categories for the ecommerce platform. “Furniture is a huge growth area for us, especially contemporary pieces and we will continue to expand this area,” OneDayOnly added. The company’s one-product, one-hour-only deal, which was launched in 2017, was another great success last year – and consumers can expect more of the same in 2018. In addition to its planned growth, OneDayOnly has made three predictions for the South African ecommerce market in 2018.
