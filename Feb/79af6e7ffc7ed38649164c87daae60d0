Sony has announced the beta release of its PlayStation 4 System Software version 5.50, which introduces several improvements. This includes play time management, enhancements to its library user interface and quick menu, updates to notifications, the ability to load custom background images from a USB drive, and supersampling mode for the PS4 Pro. “With supersampling mode, some games will render at a higher resolution and then be downscaled to match the HDTV – allowing PS4 Pro owners to leverage the benefits of an image clarity boost even if their PS4 Pro is not connected to a 4K TV,” said Sony. “Please note performance will vary, as games are optimised differently to take advantage of the power of the PS4 Pro.”
