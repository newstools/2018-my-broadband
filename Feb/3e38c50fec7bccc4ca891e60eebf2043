Over 550,000 people have downloaded the UberEATS app in South Africa, and it is getting over 10,000 additional downloads every week. This is according to Uber Africa spokesperson Samantha Allenberg, who told MyBroadband that UberEATS is doing well in the country. Since UberEATS launched in South Africa in September 2016, it has partnered with over 1,200 restaurants in Cape Town, Stellenbosch, Johannesburg, Durban, and Pretoria. UberEATS now delivers over 35,000 unique items from the restaurant and stores, with an average delivery time of 33 minutes. Uber has also shown strong growth in South Africa, and currently has over one million active riders and 13,000 active drivers. “We have also noticed repeat Uber usage, which is a prime example of shifting private transport perceptions,” said Allenberg. “For example, in September 2017, almost 25,000 riders used Uber more than 10 times a week.” This shows an increase in adoption of tech-driven solutions – not just as a leisure transport option, but for work and business purposes. “We hope to see more driver-partners join the app as we believe this will enable a thousand more drivers in the coming years,” she said.
