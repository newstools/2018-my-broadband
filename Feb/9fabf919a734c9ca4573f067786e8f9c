Cell C will launch a triple-play offering which includes fibre, voice, and entertainment products this year. During the presentation of its financial results for the year ended 31 December 2017, the company announced the bundled package will launch in the second quarter of 2018. The offering integrates a number of Cell C’s products into a simple package, and will include the following: The uncapped voice offering applies to calls made on Cell C’s network, with calls to other networks capped at a certain number of minutes. Mobile data will not be bundled with the package, and Cell C customers will have to purchase data to consume Black content when not connected to their uncapped fibre. However, Cell C customers can purchase Black data bundles, which allow customers to consume 1GB of the platform’s content for R30. There is currently no pricing or official release date for the bundled offering, but Cell C CEO Jose Dos Santos confirmed the package will launch in Q2. Cell C’s Black entertainment platform offers everything from video and music streaming, to concert tickets and sports betting. The company said the service has seen impressive mobile growth since its launch in November 2017, gaining over 100,000 mobile app downloads on Android and 9,000 on iOS. Black has also grown popular across other devices, including laptops and the service’s dedicated BlackBOX set-top box.
