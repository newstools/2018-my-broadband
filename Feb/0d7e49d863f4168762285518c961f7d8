Rain, which operates a high-speed fixed-LTE services across South Africa, recently said it has experienced congestion on a small percentage of its sites. The operator said it has 1,880 active sites in major metropolitan areas throughout the country, and that the congestion during peak times only affects a small percentage of users. “The vast majority of our users are still enjoying a very good service with average speeds from 15Mbps, with the best we have seen exceeding 100Mbps,” said Rain. The operator added that it is working to optimise its congested LTE sites, and is deploying more sites to alleviate congestion on its network. Rain’s statement comes after several users complained about slow performance on the LTE network – with speeds of below 1Mbps in certain cases. To see if Rain is delivering on its claims, MyBroadband examined Rain’s network performance using data from the MyBroadband Speed Test platform. The 2018 results show Rain’s real-world download speeds ranging between 1.3Mbps and 98.9Mbps. The average download speed for Rain across the country was 19.1Mbps, while the average upload speed was 19.2Mbps.
