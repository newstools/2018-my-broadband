South Africa’s mobile operators are investing billions into their networks each year, and the value of these investments is evident in the high average speeds experienced by mobile subscribers. MyBroadband’s January 2018 speed test results show that the average mobile data download speed in South Africa is 24Mbps, while the average upload speed is 10Mbps. The results are based on tens of thousands of speed tests performed using the MyBroadband Android and iOS Speed Test apps. Not all areas in South Africa offer excellent mobile data speeds, however. The speed test results show that residents in major cities enjoy much higher speeds than their counterparts in rural areas. The suburb with the highest average speed in January was Goodwood in Cape Town, with an average download speed of 54Mbps. Two other Cape Town suburbs, Parow and Belville, were ranked second and third with 51.3Mbps and 50.8Mbps respectively.
