Cool Ideas had an excellent 2017, which included topping MyBroadband’s ISP rankings in Q4 2017, and ranking as the top provider in Netflix’s ISP Speed Index for December. Consumers have taken note of these achievements and have started to migrate to Cool Ideas for their fixed broadband needs, said the company. Cool Ideas CEO Paul Butschi told MyBroadband that they tripled their user base in 2017, which was impressive in an economy which has not shown much growth. The company is not sitting back, however, and looks forward to connecting to the SACS undersea cable in 2018 – which will offer its subscribers lower latency to the USA and South America. To continue its impressive subscriber growth will not be easy for Cool Ideas, unless more South African households sign up for fixed broadband services. Butschi said the success of Vumatel’s massive fibre rollout across South Africa helps, but that more can be achieved. He said increasing broadband adoption is not difficult – the government and regulatory agencies should simply interfere less. Butschi added that the South African broadband market is mature and highly competitive, and government interference is merely a hindrance to progress.
