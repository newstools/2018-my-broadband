Google is making changes to its Google Images search, which it said is aimed at connecting users and useful websites. “This will include removing the View Image button. The Visit button remains, so users can see images in the context of the web pages they’re on,” said Google. The View Image button allowed Google users to view a full image without visiting the website where the image was hosted. The Search by Image button is also being removed, but reverse image search still works. Google confirmed the changes partly came about due to its settlement with Getty Images this week. “They are designed to strike a balance between serving user needs and publisher concerns, both stakeholders we value,” said Google.
