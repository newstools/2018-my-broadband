Samsung opened its factory in the Dube Trade Port in Durban during 2014, promising a total investment of $20 million over four years. Due to the factory’s success in creating jobs and giving back to the local economy and community, it is expanding its operations to export products into the rest of the SADC region. “The plant assembles the entire range of Samsung TVs,” the company told MyBroadband. “Production capacity is 5,000 units per day, including monitors. The TVs manufactured are exported to SADC regions, and to East and West Africa.” While Samsung was able to provide certain statistics relating to the factory, it said it is not in a position to divulge the investment value at Dube Trade Port. “Since opening in 2014, only 4% of factory operators employed had formal manufacturing experience in the metal and engineering industries,” said Samsung. “All 200 staff, of which 42% are female, have been upskilled and fully trained. Seven operators have been promoted.” Samsung is currently building a distributing centre on an adjoining site to the factory, which it said will streamline its operations and create more jobs. The Dube TradePort Corporation announced in 2016 that the additional warehouse facility represented an investment of R35 million.
