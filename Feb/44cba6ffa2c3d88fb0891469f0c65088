Ben Pearson, founder of Old Ham Media, has created a website to follow Elon Musk’s Tesla Roadster in space. The Roadster was launched into space by the Falcon Heavy rocket, which features three boosters and 27 Merlin engines. The Tesla Roadster, with a spacesuit-wearing mannequin inside, was sent towards an Earth-Mars elliptical orbit around the sun. Musk outfitted his Roadster with cameras to capture views of the car, but the batteries only lasted for roughly 12 hours. Since then, many people have asked where the Tesla Roadster is, and Pearson decided to build a website to track Musk’s Tesla using data from JPL Horizons. “I have a script that I run periodically to update the information files that I have, which will allow for me to track this object, to the best of human understanding, for some time to come,” he said.
