Church spires across the UK will be used to boost digital connectivity in rural areas, following an agreement between the government and the Church of England. The agreement will encourage the Church of England to use its buildings to improve mobile and Wi-Fi connectivity for local communities. 65% of Anglican churches and 66% of parishes in England are in rural areas, and their locations are at the heart of their communities. This means the churches are often well placed to address connectivity and coverage problems. The UK government said guidance set out by the churches ensures that any telecoms infrastructure does not impact on the character and architecture of the buildings.
