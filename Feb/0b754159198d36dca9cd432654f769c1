Samsung has launched its Galaxy S9 and S9+ flagship smartphones, which feature improved camera systems and Samsung’s Infinity Edge display. The Galaxy S9 sports a dual-aperture camera which can automatically switch between apertures, depending on lighting conditions. The device can also take super slow-motion video, recording 720p videos at 960 frames-per-second. This can essentially turn a 0.2-second clip into a six-second slow-motion video. Samsung’s Galaxy S9 and S9+ also include new software features, such as AR Emoji and enhanced Bixby AI functionality. The fingerprint sensor remains at the back of the device, while the new model includes facial recognition and iris scanning. The Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ are priced at R15,499 and R17,999 respectively, and are set to launch in South Africa in March 2018. Samsung kindly provided a Galaxy S9 unit to MyBroadband, which we have photographed and posted below. The Galaxy S9 fits comfortably in a single hand, while its fingerprint sensor is in the perfect spot for quick unlocks. The 18.5:9 aspect ratio provides lots of screen real estate, while also making the device comfortable to operate. As a Samsung and Android fan, I can’t wait to play with the S9 in the coming weeks. I’ve just set up my Google account on the device and am ready to see what it has to offer.
