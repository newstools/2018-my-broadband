Cool Ideas has relocated to new offices in Rosebank. This comes after the company told MyBroadband it had an excellent 2017, tripling its user base despite the poor growth in South Africa’s economy. It topped MyBroadband’s ISP rankings in Q4 2017 and has consistently ranked as the top provider in Netflix’s ISP Speed Index. The company said broadband users have taken note of these achievements, and have started to migrate to the ISP for their fixed-broadband needs. Cool Ideas is an Internet service provider that focuses exclusively on fibre-based broadband services. As residents of Parkhurst, cofounders Andre Jooste and Paul Butschi were involved in the community’s fibre project that saw Vumatel roll out its first suburban fibre network. Cool Ideas currently offers services on 22 fibre infrastructure providers and its product portfolio only contains uncapped accounts. Ranging from 10Mbps to 200Mbps, the service provider does not implement any shaping policies on its accounts, saying this makes things easier for the business. “Offering true uncapped and unshaped simplifies things, as all you are doing is moving more data, not restricting or tampering with it,” Butschi told MyBroadband.
