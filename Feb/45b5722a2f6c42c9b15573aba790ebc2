Sweden is considering maximum jail terms of six years for “gross infringement” of copyright and trademarks, TorrentFreak reported. This follows the government stating that penalties for copyright infringement appear to be low. The Minister for Justice of Sweden, Heléne Fritzon, has now received a report that proposed an additional tier of special offences with more severe punishments. For “normal” copyright or trademark infringement, those found guilty in Sweden will face fines and a maximum prison term of two years. “In cases of gross crimes, a person may be convicted of gross copyright infringement or gross trademark infringement and sent to prison for at least six months and not more than six years,” stated the report. It would also allow the state to confiscate physical and intangible property, such as domains names. According to the report, the amendment is to deal with the difficulty the Swedish justice system faced in taking over thepiratebay.se domain during the trial of its founders. The Pirate Bay founders were tried under old legislation and received sentences of between 4-10 months.
