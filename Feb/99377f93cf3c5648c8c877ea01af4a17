While it’s been a tough year already for the top two digital currencies, things may soon be looking up. Conditions are forming for a rebound in Bitcoin and Ether, which have tanked this year amid mounting concern that they’re in the midst of a deflating bubble, according to Rob Sluymer, a technical strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “It is premature to conclude a major low has developed for BTC, ETH and our FS CryptoFX indices, but we do see a technical case to support an oversold trading rally from current levels,” he wrote in a report Friday. Bitcoin investors should see the reversal start at the 200-day moving average, which was at $7,780 when the report was written, Sluymer said. It’s now at $6,224, according to Bloomberg data.
