Coinbase has disabled new credit card registrations for US customers. This follows multiple credit card issuers placing restrictions or additional fees on the purchase of cryptocurrencies. “At the moment, Coinbase cannot ensure customers will have a positive purchasing experience with a credit card,” it said. “As a result, we have disabled adding new credit cards as a payment method for US customers.” Customers who have already registered credit cards on the exchange will be able to continue using them, provided their card issuers continue to allow the purchase of cryptocurrency. Coinbase said it is working with card issuers to find a long-term solution to resolve related issues.
