The South African Post Office website has been down for days, leaving customers frustrated and unable to perform online tasks. Additionally, customers have reported that calls to the company’s call centre are not answered. “Not sure how exactly we are supposed to track packages,” said one customer. Third-party tracking services are no help to users either, as they use a Post Office API for their services – which is also down. MyBroadband attempted to contact the Post Office helpdesk for details about the downtime, but the company’s call centre lines did not work. Getting comment via email was also futile, and there has been no official communication through the Post Office’s social media platforms. SAPO CEO Mark Barnes previously said ecommerce was one of the promising new revenue streams for the organisation. To gain the trust of local online retailers, however, the Post Office must provide a service which matches established courier services like DHL and FedEx. The prolonged website downtime sees the Post Office taking a massive step backwards in achieving this.
