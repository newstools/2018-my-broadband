eBay has signed an agreement with Adyen, a payments processor, to become its primary payments processing partner. PayPal, a long-time eBay partner, will be a payments option at checkout for eBay buyers. The move will assist the company to “improve its customer experience by intermediating payments on its Marketplace platform”. “In doing so, eBay will manage the payments flow, simplifying the end-to-end experience for buyers and sellers,” it said. The transition to full payments intermediation will be a multi-year journey. eBay said it will move as quickly as possible to complete the process within the parameters of the Operating Agreement with PayPal, which remains in place until 2020.
