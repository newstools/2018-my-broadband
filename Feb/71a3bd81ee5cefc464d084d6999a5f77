YouTube is introducing more ways to watch live videos and interact with the community in real time. This includes YouTube rolling out chat replay, which allows users to follow a conversation after a live stream is over. Live chat replays will show up alongside the video, exactly as it appeared live. It is also bringing English automatic captions to live streams, which provide a quick way to make live streams more accessible. “With our live automatic speech recognition (LASR) technology, you’ll get captions with error rates and latency approaching industry standards,” said YouTube. Creators can also add a location tag to their mobile live streams and video uploads, and share their favourite hot spots with viewers. “You can explore other videos with the same location tag by simply clicking on it. You can also use the location filter on the search results,” said the company.
