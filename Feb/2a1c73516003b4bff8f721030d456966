HP’s first Always Connected PC running Windows 10 S is now on sale. The device – the HP Envy x2 – is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 CPU and is available for $999. A selling point of this PC is its built-in 4G connectivity, which users can stay connected when there is no active Wi-Fi connection available. HP said the PC also sports 22 hours of battery life, a 12.3″ (1,920 x 1,280) touch display, a Qualcomm Adreno 540 GPU, 4GB RAM, and 128GB UFS storage. “Sleek, strong, and unbelievably mobile – this is what freedom looks like,” said HP of the 6.9mm-thick device.
