The Wikimedia Foundation has announced that free access to Wikipedia will end in 2018, which was part of the Wikipedia Zero partnership programme. Wikipedia Zero was created in 2012 to address high mobile data costs when accessing the service. The foundation partnered with mobile operators to waive mobile data fees for their users to freely access Wikipedia on mobile devices. “Over the course of this year, no additional Wikipedia Zero partnerships will be formed and the remaining partnerships with mobile operators will expire,” said the Wikimedia Foundation. In the programme’s six-year run, the foundation partnered with 97 mobile carriers in 72 countries. “Since 2016, we have seen a significant drop off in adoption and interest in the program.” This may be due to the rapidly-shifting mobile industry, as well as changes in mobile data costs, said the foundation.
