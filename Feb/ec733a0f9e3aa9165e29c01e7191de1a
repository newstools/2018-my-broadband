VideoLAN, the developers of VLC media player, told TorrentFreak it is struggling to get clones of its software removed from Google Play. This follows the company recently turning down millions of euros to bundle its software with advertising. VLC is an open source application licensed under the GNU General Public License, which means you may use its code as long as you publish any software you develop based on it. An Android application called 321 Media Player has cloned VLC and bolted advertising onto it, but has not published its source code. According to VideoLAN, the advertising is closed-source software, which is not permitted by the GPL. “The application here is just a parasite and I think they are useless and dangerous,” said VideoLAN president Jean-Baptiste Kempf. His team is also opposed to turning VLC into adware. “Integrating crap, adware, and spyware with VLC is not okay,” said Kempf.
