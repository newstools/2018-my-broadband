Arizona is discussing a bill that could allow people to pay their taxes with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Fox News reported. The state is also contemplating recognising cryptocurrencies as currency and not a commodity. The bill passed the Senate Finance Committee with a vote of 4-3 and was co-sponsored by Arizona state representative Jeff Weninger. “It’s one of a litany of bills that we’re running that is sending a signal to everyone in the United States, and possibly throughout the world, that Arizona is going to be the place to be for blockchain and digital currency technology in the future,” said Weninger.
