Sony Mobile has unveiled a pair of new flagship smartphones, the Xperia XZ2 and Xperia XZ2 Compact. The company unveiled the devices at Mobile World Congress 2018. The Xperia XZ2 sports a 5.7-inch HDR display, while the smaller XZ2 Compact has a 5.0-inch HDR screen. Both devices are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 processor, and support wireless charging and USB Type-C. The Snapdragon 845 allows for connectivity speeds of up to 1.2Gbps and offers improved battery life compared to older chips. Sony said the new smartphones feature Sony’s Advanced Motion Eye camera system, which supports video recording at 4K with HDR. Additionally, the Xperia XZ2 will sport a “dynamic vibration system”, which intelligently turns audio signals into vibrations – offering added immersion when consuming media. The Xperia XZ2 and Xperia XZ2 Compact also support slow-motion video recording at 960 frames per second at a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080. The ability to create interactive 3D selfies, which can be shared to social media, is another feature added by Sony. The Xperia XZ2 and Xperia XZ2 Compact will start shipping globally in March 2018, and are available in four colours: black, silver, green, and pink. The Xperia XZ2 is expected to arrive in South Africa in May 2018, while the local launch date of the Compact is unconfirmed. There is currently no pricing information for the XZ2 or XZ2 Compact.
