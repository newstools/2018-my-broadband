AMD recently announced that it would lower the price of its Ryzen desktop processors internationally. The discounts will not apply to all processors, but certain units have been slashed by up to 30%. MyBroadband spoke to Rebel Tech about the effect of the price cuts in South Africa, and it confirmed discounts would arrive. The online retailer said new Ryzen processors will arrive in around three weeks and the discounts will be applied to the retail price. The price reduction of Ryzen desktop CPUs follows the companyâ€™s unveiling of a second-generation of Ryzen desktop processors.
