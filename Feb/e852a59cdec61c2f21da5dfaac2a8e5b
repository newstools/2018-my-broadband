The iOS apps for Telegram and Telegram X disappeared from the app store today without warning, 9to5Mac reported. “We were alerted by Apple that inappropriate content was made available to our users and both apps were taken off the App Store,” said Telegram CEO Pavel Durov. “Once we have protections in place we expect the apps to be back on the App Store.” It is not clear what inappropriate content was made available on Telegram, but TechCrunch reported that Apple’s guidelines state apps that facilitate user-generated content must have a method for filtering objectionable material from being posted to the app.
