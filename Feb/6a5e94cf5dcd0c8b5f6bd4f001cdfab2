Razer is growing its presence in South Africa and local consumers can expect many new gaming products this year. This is according to Ruan Kraft, product manager for Razer at Apex Interactive. Kraft told MyBroadband that 2017 was a great year for Razer in South Africa, with strong growth in sales and brand awareness. Razer products are now available through major retailers, including BT Games, Incredible Connection, Makro, Takealot, Evetech, and many other retailers, resellers, and online stores. This wider availability assisted with sales growth, while the company’s involvement with major esport events helped to grow its brand awareness among gamers. Razer’s peripherals make up the company’s bestselling products, and include the Ornata Chroma keyboard, Deathadder Elite mouse, and the Kraken Pro V2 and Kraken 7.1 V2 headsets. The company is set to continue its strong performance in 2018, with a range of new products which launched in January. These products include the Electra headset, Tartarus V2 keypad, Naga Trinity mouse, and Pewdiepie Kraken Pro Headset. “In April, another handful of products will be available, like the Hyperflux bundle, Nommo, and many more high-tech products,” said Kraft. Other key Razer products that Apex Interactive is working to make available in South Africa include the Blade laptop range and the Razer phone. “We don’t have the rights to distribute these products in South Africa yet, but we are working on it,” said Kraft.
