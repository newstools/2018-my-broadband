Axxess is now offering Cell C’s new fixed-LTE packages, following their unveiling in January. The LTE packages were launched by Cell C in partnership with Internet Solutions – with local ISPs to offer them to consumers. “The partnership works similarly to Rain – however, it is a Cell C offer through Internet Solutions’ billing and distribution platform. IS resellers then sell the packages to their customers,” said IS.
