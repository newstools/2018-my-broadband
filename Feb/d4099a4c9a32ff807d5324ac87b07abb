2018 has been a wild year for the cryptocurrency market so far, with coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum falling over 50%. This comes after the tokens reached all-time highs in December 2017. The market once again demonstrated its volatility this week – albeit in a positive direction – with Bitcoin rallying over the last few days. Bitcoin has now passed the $10,000 price point, after falling below $6,000 just 10 days ago. The price of Bitcoin is historically volatile, but it may have been influenced by recent worries about the regulation of Bitcoin by governments. Many credit card issuers have also limited the ability of customers to buy Bitcoin on credit, with US exchange Coinbase disabling new credit card registrations.
