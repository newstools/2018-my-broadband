Ehang has successfully conducted tests of its 184 passenger drone. The test flights carried human passengers and demonstrated the reliability of the quadcopter in fog, heavy wind, and rain. Ehang aims to use the passenger drone as an autonomous air taxi in urban environments. The drone can automatically fly to a passengerâ€™s destination at the push of a button and human pilots can remotely control the drone if there are problems. Ehang has conducted thousands of flight tests in both single and double-seater passenger drones.
