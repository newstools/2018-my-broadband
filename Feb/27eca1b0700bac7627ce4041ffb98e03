With many modern smartphones featuring high IP ratings, users see it as a licence to take their device, jump into a pool, and record a slow-motion video of the splash. Unfortunately, that’s not how a “waterproof” smartphone works – while IP ratings are not equal on all devices. Before you take that waterfall selfie, here are key specifications you must understand. The IP rating of a device – referred to as its ingress protection rating – lets a user know if the smartphone is dust and water resistant. The standard is defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission, with each number in the rating related to a level of protection. In the case of IP68, for example, the 6 stands for “No ingress of dust”, while the 8 stands for “The device can be submerged [in water] to a greater depth, specified by manufacturer”. While the IP rating on a device is a good starting point for judging your smartphone’s physical abilities, it is not as important as what the manufacturer states. For example: the Samsung Galaxy S7 has an IP rating of IP68. The device’s solid particle protection rating of 6 means it is completely dust-tight. Its liquid ingress protection rating of 8 means it can remain submerged at a depth of 1.5m for 30 minutes – but this measure is defined by Samsung. The CAT S60, marketed as a “rugged smartphone”, is also rated IP68 – but its makers state it can remain underwater at a depth of 5m for one hour. In short, an IP68 rating does mean your phone can withstand water and dust, but the degree to which it can do this is ultimately defined by the manufacturer. Check the specifications page of your device on the manufacturer’s website to find out what your smartphone can handle before you go for a swim with it. An outline of IP ratings, as defined by IEC standard 60529 is detailed below.
