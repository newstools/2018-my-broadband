Cloudflare notified Sci-Hub of a court order which compelled it to terminate services for three of its domain names, the website revealed in a tweet. Known as “The Pirate Bay of Science”, Sci-Hub warned that Cloudflare’s disconnection of its domains may cause a short period of downtime for the website. TorrentFreak noted that Cloudflare’s notice to Sci-Hub is significant, as it previously contested injunctions brought against its clients by organisations such as the Recording Industry Association of America. It also comes after adult content publisher ALS Scan argued in a court in California that Cloudflare should be held liable for the activities of its clients who enable copyright infringement.
