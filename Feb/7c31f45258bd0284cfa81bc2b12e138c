The entertainment division of Alibaba Group has signed an agreement to show many of Disney’s movies and series in China on its streaming service Youku, Variety reported. Over 1,000 episodes of Disney series are covered, including “DuckTales” and “My Friends Tigger and Pooh”. For the first two years of the deal, 600 of these episodes will be exclusive to Alibaba. The rights to 100 Disney films have also been secured. These are not exclusive to Youku. Disney’s streaming service, DisneyLife, stopped operating in China nearly two years ago. Chinese regulators reportedly shut down the service five months after it launched. TechCrunch speculated that the reason for its closure was the enactment of laws that required foreign companies to get government approval before publishing online content.
