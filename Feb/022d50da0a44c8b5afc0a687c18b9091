Intel has unveiled its Xeon D-2100 processor, a system-on-chip to address the needs of edge applications, and data centre or network applications. The D-2100 extends the performance of the Intel Xeon Scalable platform from the heart of the data centre, to the network edge and web tier, said Intel. It is aimed at addressing the need of network operators and cloud service providers to continuously grow performance and capacity without increasing power consumption. The D-2100 processors include up to 18 “Skylake-server” generation Intel Xeon processor cores and integrated Intel QuickAssist Technology, with up to 100Gbps of built-in cryptography, decryption, and encryption acceleration. The product will also be supported by system software updates to protect customers from the exploits referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown.”
