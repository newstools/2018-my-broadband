ASUS has unveiled its ZenFone 5Z smartphone at Mobile World Congress. The 6.2-inch device – which features a 90% screen-to-body ratio – has been called a “shameless iPhone X clone” by international reviewers. ASUS has packed a dual-camera system, Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip, Snapdragon X20 Gigabit LTE modem, 6GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage into the phone. “It’s the first-ever ZenFone model to harness the power of the latest Snapdragon 845 Mobile Platform with AIE, featuring a 3rd-generation AI platform,” said ASUS. The ZenFone 5Z starts at $499 in the US, added the company. Images of the device are posted below.
