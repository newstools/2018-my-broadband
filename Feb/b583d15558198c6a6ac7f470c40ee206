Cell C’s new fixed-LTE packages do not have strict device restrictions, said Axxess. Axxess was the first ISP to launch Cell C’s fixed-LTE packages, which are being made available through Internet Solutions. Axxess told MyBroadband that if your device supports LTE and is in an appropriate LTE coverage area, the package’s Cell C SIM will work. This follows concerns that the service may be limited to certain devices, as Rain instituted for its fixed-LTE service. Another question raised by potential customers was whether the Cell C fixed-LTE service would be able to roam on Vodacom’s network, in a similar way to how Cell C mobile customers can roam on Vodacom in certain scenarios. Axxess said the Cell C fixed-LTE service is dedicated to the Cell C network, with no roaming.
