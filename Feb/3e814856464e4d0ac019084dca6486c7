Zero-fee trading platform Robinhood has added cryptocurrency trading support to its service. “The first set of Robinhood customers can buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum with Robinhood Crypto,” said Robinhood. Access to the new feature is being rolled out to customers in the US. “In the meantime, all investors on Robinhood can monitor and track market data for 16 cryptocurrencies.” The company also unveiled Robinhood Feed – a way to discuss cryptocurrencies, news, and market swings with other investors. Feed is available to a limited number of users on the platform.
