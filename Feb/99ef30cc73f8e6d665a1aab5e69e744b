Huawei has introduced the P smart, an affordable smartphone with full view display and a dual camera setup. “It’s the first time the industry will see both a dual camera and FullView display at this price range and we are excited to introduce this to the South African market,” said Likun Zhao GM of the Huawei Consumer Business. Its camera offers the ability to take self portraits using hand gestures, bokeh effects, and a beauty shot mode. This is supported by facial recognition, gender recognition, and a 10-level skin improvement effect for portraits and self portraits. The P Smart also features a one-touch split screen mode which lets you have two apps open at the same time. Huawei promises fingerprint recognition within 0.3 seconds with the fingerprint 4.0 system built into the Huawei P smart. It has also combined fingerprint recognition with functions like fingerprint navigation, fingerprint shot, and alarm clock deactivation. The Huawei P smart is available for purchase at all operators in South Africa immediately at a recommended retail price of R3,999.
