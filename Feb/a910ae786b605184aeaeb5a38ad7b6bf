Ubisoft announced is investigating the implementation of blockchain-based assets in video games. Ubisoft Strategic Innovation Lab director Lidwine Sauer said the fascination with cryptocurrencies has driven the company to investigate applications of the technology. Sauer said blockchain-based digital assets will allow gamers to truly own their in-game collectibles or cosmetic items. “Thanks to the blockchain, we can now have the equivalent of a digital Picasso, with the advantage that it’s a lot more difficult to steal something on the blockchain than to steal a Picasso,” she said. Ubisoft did not state whether blockchain-based assets will be implemented in upcoming games or integrated with existing microtransaction models.
