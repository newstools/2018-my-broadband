Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has hinted the platform may replace News Feed with Stories, Business Insider reported. “We expect Stories are on track to overtake posts in Feed as the most common way that people share across all social apps,” said Zuckerberg. According to the report, Facebook copied Stories from rival Snapchat and integrated it into its products last year. Zuckerberg said WhatsApp and Instagram have become the top two apps for sharing Stories worldwide.
