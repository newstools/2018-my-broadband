If President Jacob Zuma admits criminal wrongdoing and turns against the Guptas, he will get the chance to escape prosecution. This is according to a report in the Sunday Times, which stated that Zuma is being offered the deal to avoid state capture charges. The report stated that Zuma and ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa are secretly negotiating the deal. The alleged negotiations come at a time when the ANC’s top members are said to be urging Zuma to step down and let Ramaphosa take over as president. Ramaphosa’s business-friendly mindset, and the positive sentiment that his taking over from Zuma is set to bring, is needed to help address years of poor economic performance in the country. ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte recently insisted that Zuma will not step down in 2018, however, and there will not be a government shake-up. The Sunday Times stated that defining the terms of Zuma’s no-prosecution deal will require the involvement of the NPA. It will also require Zuma to help the police and NPA prosecute the Guptas, and possibly his son, Duduzane. In the event of a prosecution, it is reported that Zuma wants the state to cover his legal costs. This may be related to non-state-capture legal matters, including corruption charges, which Zuma could face.
