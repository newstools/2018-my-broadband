Arnold Schwarzenegger has joined the cast of Kung Fury, joining Michael Fassbender, David Hasselhoff, and David Sandberg, Variety reported. David Sandberg is producing a feature-length film based on his “Kung Fury” short film – a parody and tribute to 1980s martial arts and police action films. After a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014, the film debuted at the 2015 Cannes Directors’ Fortnight. Set in Miami, but filmed in Sweden, Sandberg is making the film under his Laser Unicorns production company. Other producers on the films include David Katzenberg, Seth Grahame-Smith, and Aaron Schmidt. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
