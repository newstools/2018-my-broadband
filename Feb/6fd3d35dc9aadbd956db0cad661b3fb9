Google has changed the name of Android Pay to Google Pay. The application was renamed as part of an update which added new features, including new Home and Card tabs. The Card tab allows you to consolidate your credit and debit cards, loyalty programmes, offers, and more, while the Home tab lets you access recent purchases, helpful info, and rewards. The platform functions in the same way as it did before the rebranding, added Google. Google Wallet has also been renamed to Google Pay Send, in line with the applicationâ€™s rebranding.
