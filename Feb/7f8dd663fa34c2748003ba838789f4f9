Microsoft is updating its Windows Defender antivirus software to protect users against unwanted software. Defender’s evaluation criteria is being updated to protect users against coercive or misleading “cleaner” programs, which prompt users for payments to clean up their storage. “There has been an increase in free versions of programs that purport to scan computers for various errors, and then use alarming, coercive messages to scare customers into buying a premium version of the same program,” said Microsoft. “In the future, programs that display coercive messaging will be classified as unwanted software, detected, and removed.” The new criteria will be implemented on 1 March 2018.
