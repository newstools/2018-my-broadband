We Are Social and Hootsuite recently published their 2018 Global Digital suite of reports, visualising data about Internet usage around the world. A global overview and in-depth breakdowns on a country-by-country basis were detailed in the reports, including data on South Africa. Citing the International Telecommunications Union, We Are Social reported that South Africa added 2 million Internet users in 2017, growing to 30.81 million and placing our Internet penetration at 54%. This is significantly higher than the recent estimates from World Wide Worx, which indicated that South Africa’s Internet penetration would be closer to 40%. Additionally, the results of Google’s Connected Consumer Study found that 65% of South Africans over the age of 16 are now online. While there may be differing statistics on the number of Internet users in South Africa, We Are Social compares countries against one another – which provides an idea of relative performance. South Africa’s Internet penetration is three percentage points above the Southern African average, and one percentage point above the global average. Based on these statistics, South Africa’s Internet user base grew by 7% in the past year. This places us 13th in the world in terms of relative Internet user growth.
