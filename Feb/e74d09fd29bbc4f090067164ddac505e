Former Eskom boss Brian Molefe’s military career is over, according to the City Press. The publication stated that Molefe’s call-up period to the armed forces ended on 17 November 2017, a day after it enquired about his new position. Molefe was called up to serve as a colonel in the army and started in August 2017 – earning R57,000 a month. It was reported that Molefe has no military experience, which caused anger among soldiers in the army. Shortly after Molefe’s appointment went public, he was also photographed wearing three military medals. One of the medals was the The Gold Mandela Commemorative Medal, honouring SANDF members who played a role in looking after Nelson Mandela during his last days, or in his state funeral. The SANDF told the City Press that Molefe was not paid for his “specialist services” during his call-up from August to November 2017. According to the report, however, “specialists” who assist the SANDF are paid. Molefe’s stint in the armed forces comes after the former Eskom CEO faced a barrage of public criticism for his poor performance at the state utility. It also came after Outa opened a criminal case against Molefe for fraud and contravening the Public Finance Management Act.
