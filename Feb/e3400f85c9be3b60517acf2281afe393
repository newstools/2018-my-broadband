AMD recently announced it would cut the prices of its first-generation Ryzen desktop processors. Rebel Tech has confirmed to MyBroadband that these price cuts are starting to take effect in South Africa, with many Ryzen processors now heavily discounted. Price reductions vary according to product, but certain Ryzen processors have seen price cuts of up to 30%. High-end CPUs are the most affected by the slashed prices, with the Ryzen 7 1800X over R1,000 cheaper. The reductions followed AMD’s announcement that it would launch a refreshed Ryzen CPU lineup this year – based on its Zen+ architecture. Pricing of the discounted Ryzen desktop processors from online retailers Wootware, Rebel Tech, Evetech, and Raru is listed below.
