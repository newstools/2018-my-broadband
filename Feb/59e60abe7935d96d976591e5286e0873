The Airbus Vahana aircraft, which is all electric and self-piloted, has completed its first flight. The Vahana test flight lasted 53 seconds, and the aircraft reached a height of 5m before descending safely. Vahana is a project developed at A³, which aims to meet the growing need for urban mobility. “In just under two years, Vahana took a concept sketch on a napkin and built a full-scale, self-piloted aircraft that has successfully completed its first flight,” said Vahana project executive Zach Lovering. The Vahana team will start additional testing in the future.
