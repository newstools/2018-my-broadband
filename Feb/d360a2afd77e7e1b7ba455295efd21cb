The “largest copyright infringement claim” involving a South African photo is set for another court showdown. According to a report by the City Press, the R2.1-billion claim is by photographer Shaun Harris regarding the use of a photo he took of Nelson Mandela in January 1999. The claim will be heard by the Pretoria High Court and is against the state for its use of the image. Harris said the image was used by the Government Communication Information System without the correct copyright clearance. The state bought the rights to use the image at Mandela’s funeral, but the report stated it was then widely used after Harris and PictureNet’s – the photographer’s agents at the time – credits were removed. Harris previously sued GCIS for R20 million for the use the picture, but his latest claim of over R2 billion is based on new evidence – a forensic report PictureNet. The report allegedly shows how the photo was used by the state “at least 2.1 million” times. Each use is penalised individually, which is how the total of R2.1 billion was calculated. The City Press stated that the state licensed the use of the photo twice, but the image was not removed from its systems. It was then copied and its credits removed, stated the report. “This action of removing the credits, says PictureNet’s lawyers, was premeditated and reprehensible and in flagrant disregard for the Copyright Act,” stated the City Press. Wenn Digital and Kodak recently unveiled KODAKOne, a rights management platform aimed at photographers which aims to deal with copyright infringement. The platform will run on a blockchain and will use its own cryptocurrency, called KODAKCoin.
