The uptake of Showmax by DStv Premium users has resulted in a big increase in usage on the platform, Showmax told MyBroadband. Showmax said it has seen a significant increase in interest and a sharp increase in usage by DStv Premium customers of late. Showmax is offered to DStv Premium users for free as part of their packages. The service costs R99 per month as a standalone product. While offering similar content to the DStv platform, Showmax said its service is acting as a complementary product to DStv’s satellite TV service. For example, users will watch all the previous seasons of Game of Thrones prior to the new episodes coming out on DStv, said Showmax. “Overall, Showmax is doing well. Our first original, Tali’s Wedding Diary, broke internal viewing records and has been a big usage driver,” said Showmax. The company added that it is also doing well when compared to its global competition.
