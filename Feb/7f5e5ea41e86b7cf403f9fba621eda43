Vox has announced it will stop offering its Uncapped Bolt-On product from 28 February 2018. The company told MyBroadband the retirement of the package was influenced by dropping ADSL prices in South Africa and the better value proposition of its Fat Pipe DSL products. “With the price of ADSL data dropping and Vox being one of the top 5 ADSL ISPs in South Africa with a competitive capped ADSL offering, we believe the features and benefits of the current Fat Pipe DSL range far exceed those of the Bolt-On product,” said Vox. The Uncapped Bolt-On package was a monthly package which offered ADSL subscribers uncapped, unshaped data usage between 18:00 and 06:00. The product was introduced when ADSL data was relatively expensive, making it a cheaper option for home users who did not want to pay for a full uncapped ADSL package. Vox also indicated that its Fat Pipe DSL packages start at R79 per month and not only provide a fixed amount of DSL data, but uncapped usage every day from midnight to 06:00. The 100GB Fat Pipe ADSL package allows up to four concurrent connections, and the subscriber’s data rolls over to a maximum of six times their base data cap.
