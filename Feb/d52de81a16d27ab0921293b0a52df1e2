T-Mobile plans to roll out 5G in 30 cities this year, including New York and Los Angeles. The company said it is focused on delivering a transformative 5G experience, and “one that works on actual smartphones”. 5G is more than only faster speeds, and enables new IoT experiences, better connectivity, smart cities, decade-long battery life, and ultra-responsive networks, said T-Mobile. To roll out the network, T-Mobile will deploy 5G-ready equipment and use low-band spectrum (600MHz). T-Mobile also plans to build 5G on millimeter wave spectrum this year. It expects to deploy 25,000 small cells to light up LAA (Licensed Assisted Access) technology that adds extra capacity and speed, while paving the way for 5G. The company said in a 5G world, LTE networks will continue to be important as the first 5G smartphones will use both 5G and LTE simultaneously.
