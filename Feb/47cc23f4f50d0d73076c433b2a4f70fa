Standards group JEDEC has revealed the Universal Flash Storage (UFS) 3.0 standard. UFS 3.0 doubles the bandwidth of UFS 2.1 to a theoretical 2.9GB/s, while power consumption is lowered and reliability in a range of temperatures is improved. The standard is aimed at mobile devices, VR headsets, Chromebooks, and the automotive sector, said the group. “To achieve the highest performance and most power efficient data transport, JEDEC UFS leverages industry leading specifications from the MIPI Alliance to form its Interconnect Layer,” said the group. “This collaboration continues with UFS version 3.0, which references the MIPI M-PHY v4.1 physical layer specification and the recently released MIPI UniProSM v1.8 transport layer specification.”
