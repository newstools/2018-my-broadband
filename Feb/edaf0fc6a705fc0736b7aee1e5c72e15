Vodacom will look to expand its Siyakha prepaid price plan by introducing new products and services, as well as improving what it currently offers, the company told MyBroadband. During its recent celebration of the one-year anniversary of Siyakha, Vodacom revealed that 7.5 million prepaid subscribers are on the tariff plan. As part of the network operator’s recent quarterly results, it showed its prepaid subscriber base in South Africa was at 36.3 million on 31 December 2017. This means that almost 21% of Vodacom’s subscriber base is on Siyakha. Vodacom Siyakha is a prepaid tariff plan, introduced in 2017, which includes funeral cover, various rewards, and zero-rated data for services aimed at the lower-income end of South Africa’s mobile market. These zero-rated services include: Vodacom said that going into the new year, it has introduced an improved version of Mum & Baby. “The new version includes more content as well as live tutorials. As 30% of the users are male, we are looking at including more holistic wellness information from managing depression and diabetes, to first aid and circumcision,” said Vodacom. “We are also looking at ways to service emigrant workers, so they too can connect with loved ones in an affordable way. More offers will be announced soon.”
