The Limpopo provincial government has appointed Altron’s Altech Radio Holdings (ARH) to establish an open access broadband network across the province. Limpopo Connexion SOC made the appointment on behalf of the government. Altron said the contract is in line with the National Broadband Policy: SA Connect. ARH said the first phase of the project will be worth R585-million and will see connectivity provided to government departments, municipalities, businesses, and households over a three-year period. Additional services to be provided include a network operation and a data centre. Altron said the appointment of ARH follows similar deployments in Gauteng. ARH is also involved in a partnership to design, deploy, maintain, and operate a city-wide backbone broadband network for the City of Tshwane.
