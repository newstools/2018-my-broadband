Axxess has launched new fixed-LTE packages which run on Cell C’s network. The LTE services are priced to take on Rain’s LTE packages and are resold through ISPs – as Rain’s are. Rain and Cell C have have both partnered with Internet Solutions for the distribution of the products to service providers such as Axxess, Afrihost, MWEB, and Webafrica. Currently, only Axxess has confirmed it will sell Cell C’s fixed LTE services. While the basic prices of Rain’s packages are the same among all ISPs, the providers differentiate themselves by offering promotions and value-added services. Afrihost offers Rain subscribers a free Huawei B315 router, a discount on a Huawei B618 router, or up to three months free if you don’t take a router, for example. Vox offers one month free on SIM-only Rain data deals and a discount on Vobi, its uncapped voice-over-IP product. With Cell C’s fixed-LTE services, Axxess is offering free delivery, and your activation month free on SIM-only deals, a free Huawei B315 router, or a discount on the Huawei B618 router. The tables below show how the prices of Rain and Cell C fixed-LTE compare. Router and activation promotions are not taken into account. (Not all Rain packages shown.) The packages also come with the option to top up your data allocation, priced as follows: Unlike fixed-line broadband services, guaranteed download and upload speeds are difficult to promise on fixed-LTE packages. The speed a user obtains is dependent on the coverage of the service provider and congestion on the network. Axxess, which sells Rain and Cell C fixed-LTE packages, advises users to check the appropriate coverage maps before signing up for a product. The ISP also gives the following speed guidelines for the LTE packages.
