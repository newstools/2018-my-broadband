Ingram Micro, the world’s largest wholesale technology distributor, has introduced top Ubiquiti products to the South African market – including UniFi products. Ubiquiti’s UniFi range provides high-end enterprise wireless networking products that allow you to connect buildings and devices wirelessly, and can be used as an alternative to laying fibre. Ingram Micro, which has operated in South Africa since 2007, is the world’s largest wholesale technology distributor – with Ubiquiti forming part of its extensive portfolio. Founded by former Apple engineer Robert Pera in 2005, Ubiquiti develops high-performance network technology for service providers and companies. The company’s UniFi products utilise innovative wireless technology to provide seamless integration of high-performance switching, gateways, access points, and more – forming the UniFi Enterprise System. The UniFi Enterprise System is a mesh-capable Wi-Fi system that delivers a combination of performance, reliability, and scalability – with top performance and competitive pricing. Within the system, UniFi’s AP-PRO access points link together to form intelligent access points, delivering full bandwidth wireless connections on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. Users can roam seamlessly between these points without having to worry about changing SSIDs. The UniFi AP-PRO access points connect to a primary switch to form a mesh network – managed by Ubiquiti’s browser-based UniFi Controller software. Each access point has a range of 180m and offers unlimited scalability, so enterprises can build wireless networks as big or small as needed, starting with one and expanding to thousands, while maintaining a single unified management system. The UniFi Switch range supports also fibre connections, and the system offers the ability to configure multiple SSIDs from the same set of hardware – each with different security and networking policies applied, allowing guests to connect to the network. Intuitive management software featuring a graphical user interface is bundled with the UniFi hardware at no extra cost and incudes no licensing fees or support costs. Using a single, intuitive interface, the UniFi Controller software conducts device discovery, provisioning, and management of UniFi devices spanning multiple locations. The graphic below illustrates how these features come together at a single site. To join Ingram Micro’s partner system, or to find out more about Ubiquiti, visit the Ingram Micro website.
