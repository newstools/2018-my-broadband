Samsung has started producing the world’s largest Serial Attached SCSI solid state drive. The 2.5-inch SSD – called the PM1643 – is aimed at next-generation enterprise storage systems and features 30.72TB of storage. It uses Samsung’s latest V-NAND technology with 64-layer, 3-bit 512-gigabit chips, said the company. “This breakthrough was made possible by combining 32 of the new 1TB NAND flash packages, each comprised of 16 stacked layers of 512Gb V-NAND chips.” Samsung said the large drive also sports fast performance. “The new PM1643 drive features random read and write speeds of up to 400,000 IOPS and 50,000 IOPS, and sequential read and write speeds of up to 2,100MB/s and 1,700MB/s, respectively,” said Samsung. “These represent approximately four times the random read performance and three times the sequential read performance of a typical 2.5-inch SATA SSD.” The company said it plans to extend the range of its new SSDs with 15.36TB, 7.68TB, 3.84TB, 1.92TB, 960GB, and 800GB versions.
