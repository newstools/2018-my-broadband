Apple has confirmed it uses Google Cloud services for iCloud, CNBC reported. This follows reports from Recode in 2016 which stated that Apple used Google Cloud to ensure it wasn’t dependent on the infrastructure of rivals. Recode said that much of iCloud is hosted with Amazon Web Services, and some with Microsoft Azure. CNBC has now reported that Apple’s latest update to its iOS Security Guide suggests Apple has switched to Amazon and Google. It reported that until recently, the document contained language indicating that iCloud services relied on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
