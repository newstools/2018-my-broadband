Apple Inc. said a “small percentage” of iPhone 7 smartphones may experience a component failure that makes it appear the phone isn’t connected to cellular networks even when service is available. Apple said it would repair affected devices at no charge. The units were sold from September 2016 to February 2018 in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau and the U.S., Apple said Friday in a statement on its website. Apple said it would reimburse those who’ve paid for a repair related to this issue. The company, which reported earnings Thursday, didn’t make clear which component has malfunctioned. The news marks Apple’s fourth official iPhone-related replacement program since 2015. Apple previously offered free repairs for limited numbers of iPhone 5s camera issues, iPhone 6 Plus touchscreen problems, and iPhone 6s devices that would randomly shut down.
