Regulators in the UK and US have announced a collaborative effort to work on Fintech projects. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the US and the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will share information regarding market trends and developments in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries. The agencies aim to improve business collaboration with regulators, in addition to studying blockchain projects to determine how they should be regulated. “We believe that by collaborating with the best-in-class FCA FinTech team, the CFTC can contribute to the growing awareness of the critical role of regulators in 21st-century digital markets,” said the organisations.
