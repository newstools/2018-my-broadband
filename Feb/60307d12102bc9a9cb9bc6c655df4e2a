Gauteng Premier David Makhura on Monday admitted that e-tolling had not worked and that he would be meeting President Cyril Ramaphosa to devise an alternative funding model. “It is loud and clear for all to see that e-tolls have not worked,” said Makhura. Speaking at the State of the Province Address at the Gauteng legislature, Makhura said e-tolls had added to the cost of living for many motorists and public transport users in the province. “Accordingly, I will engage President Ramaphosa in order to find a new and more equitable funding model to support the continued expansion of Gauteng’s road network and public transport system. Please send me!” he said, repeating Ramaphosa’s mantra which the president lifted from a Hugh Masekela’s song, Thuma Mina. The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) welcomed Makhura’s acknowledgement, saying the compliance rate for e-toll users was only 29%. “OUTA is preparing a submission for the Minister of Transport and the President and will engage with the executive to show the negative impact e-tolls have had on the public and on the SANRAL budget and to propose alternative funding models,” said OUTA transport portfolio manager Rudie Heyneke. “The collection costs and litigation costs are too high when measured against the revenue generated by e-tolls.” On Monday, Makhura began his address by congratulating Ramaphosa on becoming the new president, saying his election would herald a new dawn of hope, renewal and change for South Africa.
