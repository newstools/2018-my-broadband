The South African laptop and PC market has been struggling in recent years, but this is set to change in 2018. This is according to Acer Africa’s business strategic head John Rustage, who said they expect the market to grow this year after two years of decline. This growth is thanks to a better economic outlook and consumers looking to replace their older technology, said Rustage. The upgrade cycle will be helped by improved consumer confidence and the stronger rand, which will drive down hardware prices in South Africa. Products which South Africans can look forward to from Acer include the thinnest notebook in the world, the Swift 7, and its monster gaming PC, the Predator Orion 9000. The 8.98mm Swift 7 laptop was unveiled at CES, and sports a 14-inch screen, an Intel Core i7 CPU, and the option for 4G LTE connectivity. Acer’s Predator Orion 9000 gaming PC offers up to an 18-core Intel Core i9, two GeForce GTX 1080 Ti graphics cards, and up to 128GB of RAM.
