SpaceX has successfully tested a high-thrust ocean landing using the Falcon 9 rocket which launched the GovSat-1 mission yesterday, Space.com reported. The launcher which carried the satellite had previously been used to launch and land the NROL-76 spy satellite in May 2017. While SpaceX has become known for landing its rockets on drone ships, no first stage landing was scheduled for the GovSat-1 mission. “This rocket was meant to test very high retrothrust landing in water so it didn’t hurt the droneship,” said SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. “Amazingly it has survived. We will try to tow it back to shore.”
