Backblaze has released its hard drive reliability statistics for Q4 2017. Backblaze, which provides backup solutions, compared hard drives used in its operations – from Seagate, Western Digital, Toshiba, and HGST – for the report. Reliability was measured as an annualised failure rate, calculated using the number of drive failures relative to the number of drives. Backblaze recorded the failure rates of its hard drives from 1 October to 31 December 2017, along with the real annual failure rate for each drive. Throughout 2017, the company swapped out its 2TB, 3TB, and 4TB drives with 10TB, 12TB, and 14TB drives. Backblaze added 25,746 drives and retired 6,442 drives in 2017, gaining an additional 211 petabytes of storage capacity during the period.
