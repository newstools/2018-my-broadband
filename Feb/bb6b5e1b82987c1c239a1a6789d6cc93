Canon South Africa had a great 2017, with strong growth in its B2B unit, its office range of hardware and solutions, and its commercial print group. Canon also achieved record market shares with its DSLR and DSC camera models, and has growth its professional video market share from 5% to over 50% in five years. The company is now looking towards building on this strong performance, with more growth in 2018. This will be done through a strong focus on printing solutions, where Canon feels it offers good value to consumers and businesses. Canon South Africa’s marketing director Michelle Janse van Vuuren told MyBroadband that the small business printing market is growing in South Africa, but with more discerning customers. Van Vuuren said small business buyers are more informed, and are comparing printers based on functionality, cost, and understanding the value of single ink. This is where Canon’s MAXIFY printers are performing well, as they offer the functionality and efficiency of a business-class printer or multifunction device at an attractive price, she said. Canon’s PIXMA G-series, in turn, fill the gap for users requiring less functionality – but who want a low cost-per-copy and reliability. Canon South Africa’s head of B2B marketing James de Waal said that while high-quality products are important, backup, support, and expertise to help drive productivity is equally vital in the business market. “We have fine-tuned our offering to ensure that we can play a supportive role to businesses,” said de Waal. “Although many challenges presented itself last year, this collaborative approach has allowed us to reflect a noteworthy growth.”
