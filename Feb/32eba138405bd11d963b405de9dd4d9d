Microsoft has started testing a new feature in Windows 10 which removes the need for passwords. According to Softpedia, the latest Insider preview release, build 17093, relies on the Authenticator app on Android and iOS to render passwords “a thing of the past”. “With the Authenticator app on your mobile device, you can authorise or block any request, and Microsoft says that passwords would be removed completely from the operating system,” stated the report. The feature is also available in Windows 10 S. The report stated that setting up the password-less experience requires users to correctly configure Windows Hello and the Authenticator app.
