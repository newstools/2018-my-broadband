Chrome’s mission to improve advertising on the web by blocking intrusive ads, like pop-ups and interstitial ads, will kick off today. Chrome will tackle the problem of disruptive advertising by removing ads from sites that do not follow the Better Ads Standards. The Better Ads Standards are the result of public consumer research by the Coalition for Better Ads. The most intrusive ad experiences include prestitial ads – full-page ads that block you from seeing the content on the page – and flashing animated ads. Google said that websites are evaluated by examining a sample of pages from the site. Depending on how many violations of the Better Ads Standards are found, the site will be evaluated as having a status of Passing, Warning, or Failing.   At a technical level, when a Chrome user navigates to a page, Chrome’s ad filter checks if that page belongs to a site that fails the Better Ads Standards. If so, network requests on the page – such as those for JavaScript or images – are checked against a list of known ad-related URL patterns. If there is a match, Chrome will block the request, preventing the ad from displaying. This set of patterns is based on the public EasyList filter rules and includes patterns matching many ad providers – including Google’s ad platforms, AdSense, and DoubleClick.  When at least one network request has been blocked, Chrome will show the user a message indicating that ad blocking has occurred, along with an option to disable this setting by selecting “allow ads on this site”. For desktop users, the notification in Chrome’s address bar will look similar to Chrome’s existing pop-up blocker. Android users will see messages in a small infobar at the bottom of their screen and can tap on “details” to see more information.
