Lexmark has shown excellent growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and expects the South African printing market to show growth this year. This is according to Lexmark’s EMEA Regional Director Danny Molhoek, who is upbeat about the printing market in the country. While the South African market declined over the last two years, the IDC predicts this trend will be reversed in 2018. Molhoek highlighted that the increased demand is mainly for colour laser devices, which was up 9% over the last year. “Lexmark managed to keep a stable number three on the market with 15.7% market share in Q3 2017, and has a great colour portfolio to ensure we meet the needs of the South African market,” said Molhoek. The political changes happening in South Africa – which have resulted in a stronger rand and a positive economic outlook – are also welcome signs. This bodes well for Lexmark and Molhoek believes it will be a good year for Lexmark in South Africa. “In South Africa, our pace picked up quite late in the year and that wasn’t enough to compensate the slow start we had in 2017,” he said. “However, we finished well and are off to a good start in 2018. I am very optimistic for our results this year.” Apart from a more positive economic outlook, Lexmark has another reason to be upbeat – many new products. “Later in the year we will see the largest new product launch I have ever seen,” said Molhoek. This, coupled with the company’s focus on optimising its channel programmes, bodes well for Lexmark’s prospects in South Africa.
