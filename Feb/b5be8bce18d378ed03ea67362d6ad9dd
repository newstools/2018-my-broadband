Steam has published its Hardware Survey for January 2018, detailing the most popular components used by PC gamers on the platform. The data shows the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 was the most popular GPU, but does not specify whether the 3GB or 6GB model is more popular. The most common amount of VRAM is 2GB, with 32.37% of Steam gamers using 2GB cards. Intel quad-core processors with a clock speed of between 3.0GHz and 3.29GHz were the most popular chips, with 29.59% of gamers using this class of processor. The Intel Core i3-8100 desktop processor is currently one of the cheapest quad-core desktop chips on the market and offers a base frequency of 3.6GHz. It should be noted that 8th-generation CPUs are only compatible with 300-series motherboards, of which the more expensive Z370 chipset is currently the only version available in South Africa. Power supplies, motherboards, and cases are not measured by the Steam Hardware Survey, and compatible products were included to provide a pricing overview of a functional PC. The Steam survey also records data on popular peripherals. The most popular primary monitor resolution was 1,920 x 1,080, with the most common multi-monitor desktop resolution being 3,840 x 1,080 â€“ indicating a dual-monitor setup. 99.93% of Steam users had a functional microphone installed on their system, while the most popular virtual reality headset was the HTC Vive. Both Intel and Nvidia gained a small amount of market share in the CPU and GPU categories respectively last month, remaining dominant over their competitors. They hold a market share of 91.9% and 86.4% respectively among Steam gamers. Windows 7 64-bit was the most popular operating system among Steam gamers for January 2018.
