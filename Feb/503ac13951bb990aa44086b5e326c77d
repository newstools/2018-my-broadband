Hackers recently compromised part of Tesla’s cloud infrastructure and used it to mine cryptocurrency, TechCrunch reported. This comes after cloud security company RedLock discovered several Kubernetes admin consoles were not password protected. According to the report, hackers discovered Tesla’s unsecured AWS pod and used it to mine cryptocurrency. They logged in and disguised the cloud computing usage and associated traffic, and it is unclear how long they were able to do so undetected. It is also not clear which coin was mined and how much of it the hackers managed to accrue.
