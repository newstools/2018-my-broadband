Samsung has introduced its new ISOCELL dual-image sensors and proprietary software. The solution supports refocusing and low-light shooting in hardware-constrained mid to entry-level smartphones, said the company. Refocusing (bokeh) and low-light shooting (LLS) support is generally exclusive to high-end smartphone models, but ISOCELL enable these features in lower-price mobile devices. This will accelerate development and reduce optimisation difficulties with dual-camera smartphones, said Samsung. “Samsung is coupling its refocusing algorithm with a 13MP and 5MP set of image sensors, and its LLS algorithm with a set of two 8MP sensors, it added.
