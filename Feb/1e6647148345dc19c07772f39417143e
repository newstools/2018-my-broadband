Vodafone plans to create the first 4G network on the Moon to support a mission by PTScientists in 2019, and has appointed Nokia as its technology partner. PTScientists is working with Vodafone Germany and Audi to achieve the first privately-funded Moon landing. “Mission to the Moon” is due to launch in 2019 from Cape Canaveral on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Nokia will create a space-grade Ultra Compact Network that will be the lightest ever developed – weighing less than one kilogram. Vodafone’s network will connect two Audi lunar rovers to a base station in an Autonomous Landing and Navigation Module (ALINA). The 4G network will enable the Audi rovers to communicate and transfer scientific data and HD video. Vodafone testing indicates that the base station should be able to broadcast 4G using the 1,800MHz frequency band and send the first live HD video feed of the Moon’s surface. This video stream will be broadcast to a global audience via a deep-space link.
