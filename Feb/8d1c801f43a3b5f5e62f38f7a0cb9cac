Facebook Inc.’s Andrew Bosworth, head of virtual and augmented reality products and hardware, said the social-media company will be making its “biggest AR/VR news” to date at the F8 conference in May. Bosworth didn’t expand on his remarks, made on Twitter, but Facebook has been working on several new products in the category, people familiar with the matter have said. The company is working on two smart speaker devices, including a model with interactive video-chat capabilities, Bloomberg News reported last year. The Menlo Park, California-based company also said it will release a $200 Oculus-branded virtual reality headset this year, without specifying exactly when. Oculus has also been working on a more powerful standalone VR headset, code-named Santa Cruz, which the company could decide to share more details on.
