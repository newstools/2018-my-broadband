Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked event on 25 February promises a device that will deliver “The Camera. Reimagined”. “Samsung will showcase the next generation of Galaxy devices that reimagines the camera and redefines the way you share your moments,” said Samsung. Invitations to the event include a large number 9, and an educated guess points towards Samsung launching the Galaxy S9 with an exceptional camera. The new device is likely to be a flagship Android smartphone, which means it has some stiff competition in the camera arena – including from existing Samsung devices. According to rankings by DxOMark, the Google Pixel 2, Apple iPhone X and iPhone 8 Plus, Huawei Mate 10 Pro, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 will be its primary competitors. The Galaxy Note 8 – which DxOMark called the “best smartphone for zoom” and scored an impressive 94 – is a high standard for Samsung to top. The Note 8 features a telephoto and wide-angle dual-camera set-up on the rear of the device, with the following specs: The device also sports x2 optical zoom, x8 digital zoom, PDAF autofocus, optical image stabilisation, dual-LED flash, and 4K at 30fps video recording. A camera which builds on, and improves, this is what Samsung will have to deliver as part of its “camera reimagined” play. Live streaming of the Galaxy event will be available on Samsung’s Galaxy page on 25 February, 19:00 South African time.
