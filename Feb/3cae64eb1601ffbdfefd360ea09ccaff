While the South African PC and hardware market was sluggish in 2017, the gaming PC market is showing strong growth. This is according to Lenovo South Africa general manager Thibault Dousson, who said they saw a trend of consumers buying at entry-level price points and entry-level technology. The gaming PC market is an exception, however, where Dousson said they have seen “very strong interest” and which is expected to grow strongly this year. To satisfy this demand, South African consumers can expect new products from Lenovo’s gaming platform Legion in 2018. Another trend is the desire for more versatility in the personal computing market, which was behind the strong sales of Lenovo’s Yoga range of convertible laptops. Dousson said that over the next few years, he expects innovative technologies to revolutionise the PC industry and change the way technology brands develop their products. “The concept of perpetual computing is taking the world by storm, as an idea that enables users to interact with PCs using their natural senses instead of traditional means,” he said. “For example, computers can now be unlocked with biometrics rather than passwords. With time, the concept will develop further to enhance the way PCs operate.”
