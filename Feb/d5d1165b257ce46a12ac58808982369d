The January 2018 MyBroadband Speed Test results reveal that Sandton residents and businesses enjoy the fastest broadband speeds in South Africa. The results are based on over 310,000 speed tests performed on MyBroadbandâ€™s HTML5 speed test platform. The speed tests include fixed-line, wireless, and mobile connections from ISPs, which means the results are representative of multiple technologies. According to the January 2018 statistics, the average download speed in Sandton was 25.9Mbps, followed by Greenside with 24.2Mbps, and Kyalami with 22.7Mbps. The table below provides an overview of the average download speed, upload speed, and latency of the top suburbs in the country. It should be noted that only suburbs with a minimum of 1,000 tests were considered for these results.
