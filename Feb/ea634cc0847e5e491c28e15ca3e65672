Samsung has unveiled its Galaxy S9 and S9+ smartphones, and hosted an Unpacked live stream event in South Africa to mark the occasion. The new devices feature improved cameras compared to the previous generation, sporting F1.5 and F2.4 aperture modes. Another change is that the fingerprint sensor now rests below the device’s camera for improved accessibility, and Samsung has included facial recognition features for user authentication. The recommended retail price of the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ in South Africa will be R15,499 and R17,999 respectively. The smartphones will launch in South Africa on 9 March 2018, added Samsung Electronics South Africa Head of Mobile Craige Fleischer.
