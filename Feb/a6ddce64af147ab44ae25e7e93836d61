Lenovo Southern Africa has sent a notice to its business partners instructing them to stop selling models of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon manufactured between December 2016 and October 2017. The notice was sent after Lenovo Global issued a recall for ThinkPad X1 Carbon 5th Generation laptops. Certain models have shipped with a loose screw, which could damage the laptop’s battery and cause a short, leading to rapid cell discharge. This may cause overheating and potentially poses a fire hazard. The 20HQ, 20HR, 20K3, and 20K4 models, including those sold in South Africa, are affected. Lenovo said it has received three customer reports worldwide of an overheat condition related to the unfastened screw. No reports of damage to persons or property, other than to the laptops, has been reported. “Lenovo has not received any reports of a fire,” it added. Lenovo Southern Africa said suppliers must contact an authorised warranty services provider to schedule an appointment to have the laptops inspected for the unfastened screw. It also recommended that suppliers inform their customers to stop using the affected laptops and schedule an appointment to have them fixed.
