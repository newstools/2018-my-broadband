VS Gaming will move the finals of its DGL Masters tournament from rAge to Comic Con Africa. Telkom’s eSports brand has been associated with rAge for many years, and the finals of its tournament have always been held at the event. This year, however, VS Gaming has partnered with Reed Exhibitions to launch Comic Con Africa. The new event will be held at the Kyalami International Convention Centre on 14-16 September, and is organised by a division of Reed Exhibitions. Reed Exhibitions organises events such as the New York Comic Con. Comic Con is known for its celebration of geek culture of all genres and media, and features comic books, toys, anime, manga, films, novels, gaming, and TV shows. Comic Con Africa will feature the above, along with a VS Gaming 1,500-person BYOC LAN and its DGL Masters League tournaments. Teams in the DGL Masters League will be in line for a R1.1-million prize pool, with the money split between Counter-Strike and Dota 2 competitors. The CEO of VS Gaming, Lenushka Parannath, told MyBroadband their partnership with Reed Exhibitions will allow VS Gaming to offer South Africa’s top gaming talent the biggest possible platform. Parannath said they haven’t made a final decision about the rest of their calendar, in terms of participating at rAge 2018.
