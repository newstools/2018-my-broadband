Samsung is expected to cut its OLED panel production as a result of Apple’s decision to reduce output of the iPhone X. This follows weaker-than-expected demand for the new phone. Nikkei Asian Review reported that Samsung Display plans to manufacture OLED panels for “20 million or fewer iPhones in the January-March quarter”. This is down from the initial target of 45-50 million iPhone OLED panels. “The new target will reduce production at the plant to around 60% of the original plan. When it comes to the facility dedicated to making panels for Apple, the rate will fall to 50% or lower,” stated the report. Samsung is now looking to supply OLED panels to other companies to make up for the reduced demand from Apple.
