Former president Jacob Zuma will have criminal charges against him reinstated, according to a report by the City Press. The report stated that prosecutors looking into representations by Zuma to avoid the courts recommended the charges are acted on. “Five senior prosecutors unanimously recommended on Friday that Zuma face all charges that were previously withdrawn against him,” stated the report. Zuma is now set to face charges of corruption, money laundering, and racketeering. The report added that Zuma will appear alongside two co-accused, who were not named. The date of Zuma’s first court appearance is also yet to be decided. The news of Zuma’s criminal charges comes after he resigned as leader of the ANC. Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa then took over the position, and subsequently took Zuma’s place as president of South Africa – a decision which has seen the rand strengthen to multi-year highs.
