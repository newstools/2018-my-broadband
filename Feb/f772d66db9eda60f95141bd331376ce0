A new app called OneCast allows Mac users to use Xbox One game streaming on their device. Xbox One Game streaming allows users to stream their gameplay to another device on their home network, and was previously only supported by Windows PCs. OneCast offers low-latency game streaming at a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 and includes support for an Xbox One wireless controller. The OneCast websiteÂ offers a licence key for the software at $11.39. Users can also download a free trial to test the application for 14 days.
