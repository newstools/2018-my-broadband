President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered his inaugural State of the Nation Address on Friday, where he unveiled a comprehensive plan to revive the ailing South African economy. As part of this plan, Ramaphosa said South Africa’s prosperity as a nation depends on its ability to take full advantage of rapid technological change. “This means that we urgently need to develop our capabilities in the areas of science, technology, and innovation,” he said. To help with this process, the government will establish a Digital Industrial Revolution Commission- which will include the private sector and civil society. The aim of the commission is to ensure that South Africa is in a position to seize the opportunities and manage the challenges of rapid advances in information and communications technology. Ramaphosa added that the drive towards the digital industrial revolution will be underpinned by the availability of efficient networks. “We will finalise our engagements with the telecommunications industry and other stakeholders to ensure that the allocation of spectrum reduces barriers to entry, promotes competition, and reduces the cost to consumers,” said Ramaphosa.
