In December 2017, WeBuyCars officially opened its new showroom in Centurion, which it said is the biggest car showroom in Africa. The showroom floor can hold around 2,000 vehicles and includes everything from luxury sports cars and superbikes, to budget hatchbacks and caravans. The company buys and sells thousands of second-hand vehicles across the country and has offices and showrooms in many major cities. MyBroadband spoke to WeBuyCars about the success of its main showroom, following its launch. WeBuyCars said the showroom has seen massive interest from customers and has quickly become the busiest WeBuyCars showroom in South Africa. The company said it sells an average of 3,000 cars per month from the showroom, which means it turns over 150% of the showroom’s floor space every month. When asked which vehicles were the most popular among buyers, WeBuyCars said double cabs and small cars were selling very well. “The most popular vehicles at the moment are small vehicles between R100,000 and R170,000,” said the company. “We also noted that double cabs are going very fast as well.” “It’s hard to pinpoint any specific car, as any vehicle that’s well-priced is selling, and all our vehicles are well priced,” it said. The company also sells a range of caravans and motorbikes, and has 30 sales staff and five insurance managers on-site to assist customers with purchases. WeBuyCars also hosts auctions, which take place every Tuesday and Thursday. These have proven popular among customers, it said. “Our auctions have done very well for us and we have now opened our auctions to the public to take part as well,” said WeBuyCars.
