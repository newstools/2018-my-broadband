Tickets for Comic Con Africa will be R120 per person for a day pass, with discounts available on passes for the whole weekend. This is according to MD for Reed Exhibitions Africa, Carol Weaving. Reed Exhibitions, the company behind New York Comic Con, will launch Comic Con Africa through its ReedPop division, in partnership with Telkom’s VS Gaming. The event will be held at the Kyalami International Convention Centre from 14-16 September. Companies which have signed to exhibit at the event include Microsoft Xbox, ASUS, Megarom, HP, MSI’s notebook division, Girl Gamers, Aikidz, and Pops Toys. The organisers have also promised a programme that will cater to all fans, covering comics, anime and manga, gaming, fantasy, science fiction, and promotions of films and TV shows. This will include panel discussions with celebrities like video game voice actors Nolan North and Troy Baker. Weaving said they were in advanced discussions with Felicia Day, and the casts of Game of Thrones and The Big Bang Theory for the event. The show will also feature a cosplay competition, and VS Gaming will run eSports competitions under its DGL brand at the event. Comic Con is usually named after the city or country it is hosted in, such as Paris Comic Con. This event will be the exception, however, and is named after the continent rather than the country. This raises the question: Does Reed Exhibitions plan on moving Comic Con Africa around the continent? Weaving told MyBroadband they selected Johannesburg as the host city for an event aimed at the whole of Africa, because of how well connected it is to the rest of the continent in terms of air travel. “There will be people from all over Africa flying in to attend Comic Con,” said Weaving. She didn’t discount the possibility there may also be a dedicated Comic Con Johannesburg, Comic Con Lagos, and Comic Con Nairobi. “The plan is to build the event in South Africa, then see about exporting it.”
