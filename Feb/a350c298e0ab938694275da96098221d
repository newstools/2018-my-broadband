ICASA recently approved the transfer of an individual electronic communications service licence from Infovan to T-Systems South Africa. “After considering applications for the transfer of one I-ECNS licence…, the transfer applications were approved and the licence issued to T-Systems South Africa,” said ICASA. Infovan operates as a subsidiary of T-Systems South Africa. T-Systems previously told MyBroadband it will look to improve connectivity to verticals that have typically been reliant on manual systems, such as mining and manufacturing. The company is also looking to automate and use cloud environments in those industries. In addition to its focus on connectivity, T-Systems said its plan for 2018 is to expand its security offerings, with an emphasis on identity and access management solutions. T-Systems was asked what it’s plans are for the licence, but it declined to comment.
