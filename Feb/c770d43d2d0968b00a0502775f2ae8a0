MTN has significantly improved the customer experience on its network, in terms of its overall voice quality and data speed metrics. This is according to Zoltan Miklos, the GM for engineering at MTN, who was speaking at the MyBroadband Underground Mobile Networking conference. MTN’s latest customer experience improvement statistics come after the network announced it would have more 3G sites than 2G sites for the first time at the end of 2017. At the end of 2017, MTN planned to have 10,954 2G sites, 11,150 3G sites, and 7,920 LTE sites online. MTN’s network improvements have paid off, with Miklos revealing the following year-on-year comparisons: Miklos said the 4G/LTE data volume statistics are particularly significant, due to the limited spectrum available to mobile networks offering LTE services. He said it becomes challenging to ensure a great customer experience when data volumes increase on a network and there are spectrum barriers to increasing capacity. The ability of a network to offer high-quality data services while consumption is increasing must therefore be seen for the achievement it is.
