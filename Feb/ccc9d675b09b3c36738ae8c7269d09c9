Sigfox has said it is battling to meet growth targets, due to the high expectations for alternative 5G-based services, Reuters reported. Competition from traditional carriers punting 5G as an Internet of Things solution, and the emerging technologies LoRa – backed by French carrier Orange – and NB-IoT – backed by Japan’s Softbank – are challenges it must face. The three companies specialise in building wireless networks that let devices connect to the Internet with low power requirements, allowing batteries to last years. Although Sigfox missed revenue targets last year, CEO Ludovic Le Moan said they see good prospects for their technology and aim to break even in the fourth quarter of 2018. If it achieves its goal, Sigfox could look at listing on a stock exchange, said Le Moan.
