Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) cofounder and activist John Perry Barlow has passed away. Barlow helped to start the EFF in 1990 in response to “a basic threat to speech” in the United States. The EFF’s Cindy Cohn said “major parts of the Internet we all know and love today exist and thrive because of Barlow’s vision and leadership”. “He always saw the Internet as a fundamental place of freedom, where voices long silenced can find an audience and people can connect with others regardless of physical distance,” said Cohen. Barlow fought to make the Internet into “a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth”.
