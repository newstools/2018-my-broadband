Apple will introduce security changes on 25 May that prevent Windows XP and Vista PCs, and Apple TV 1st generation units from using the iTunes Store. “If you have a Windows XP or Vista PC, your computer is no longer supported by Microsoft and you’re not able to use the latest version of iTunes,” said Apple. Windows XP and Vista users can continue to use previous versions of iTunes without support from Apple, however. These users won’t be able to make new purchases from the iTunes Store or redownload previous purchases on their computer. “After May 25, you’ll need to use Windows 7 or later with the latest version of iTunes to make purchases.”
