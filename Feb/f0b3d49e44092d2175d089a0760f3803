Microsoft has released a new Windows 10 Insider Preview Build, which includes an “Ultimate Performance” power usage policy. The Ultimate Performance mode can be accessed and enabled via the power scheme selection options, and builds on the High Performance policy. The power scheme is aimed at reducing micro-latencies associated with power management techniques. Ultimate Performance is not currently available on battery-powered systems, but this could change as the feature is rolled out.
