Huawei has revealed its MateBook X Pro at Mobile World Congress 2018. The MateBook X Pro, which Huawei calls “a thing of beauty”, features a 3K resolution touchscreen and runs on Windows 10. The 3K screen – 3,000 x 2,000 – is 13.9 inches and features a 3:2 aspect ratio. “The MateBook X Pro exceeds Retina level display for a clearer, brighter view,” said Huawei, in apparent reference to Apple’s Retina displays. The screen is also being touted as the world’s first FullView Touchscreen on a notebook, with the device featuring a 91% screen-to-body ratio. Huawei has also given the MateBook X Pro a metal unibody design with a sandblasted finish, a spill-proof, backlit keyboard, and a power button with a built-in fingerprint sensor. On the inside, Huawei has fitted an Intel Core i7 8th-Gen processor at the top-end, which it said delivers fast performance, and a Core i5 in the cheaper model. This is powered by a battery which promises 12 hours of battery life, added the company. The laptop also features several connectivity options, including a USB-A, two USB-C, and headphone jack ports. The MateBook X Pro will be available in Space Grey and Mystic Silver. Pricing for the device, set to launch in Q2 2018, is as follows: South Africa is not in the initial launch wave for the device.
