President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to replace ministers who were linked to the Guptas and who performed poorly in recent years. The City Press quoted ANC alliance partners, stating that ministers who were allegedly involved in state capture could contaminate the cabinet. The newspaper listed four ministers whose heads were on the block: According to a report from Netwerk24, the return of Pravin Gordhan as minister of public enterprises is expected. Others who are expected to be named as ministers in Ramaphosa’s cabinet include Lindiwe Sisulu as deputy president and Zweli Mkhize as finance minister. As a token of unity, it is speculated that Ramaphosa will offer Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma the position of social development minister. However, The Sunday Times reported that Dlamini-Zuma told Ramaphosa she wants to step down as a National Assembly member. “According to ANC sources, Dlamini-Zuma told party bosses that she was tired and had enough of politics, and wants to quit parliament,” the newspaper reported.
