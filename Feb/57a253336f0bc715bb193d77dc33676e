The South African telecommunications market continues to evolve, with Wi-Fi remaining a prominent technology in this evolution. Wi-Fi continues to become faster and more ubiquitous, and remains a popular technology to keep users connected. To see what the local telecoms market has in store for 2018, MyBroadband spoke to Riaan Graham, director for sales in sub-Saharan Africa for Ruckus Networks. Looking into 2018, we believe the state of the Wi-Fi industry continues to look positive. The bottom line is that Wi-Fi is the most suitable solution for the data challenges arising from a worldwide infatuation with, and insatiable demand for, extended and better wireless data services of all types – a utility certainly worth the investment. Furthermore, the trends below are marking the Wi-Fi landscape: 2017 was a great year for Ruckus Wireless. We witnessed the biggest uptake of the following products: 2018 will see a new, streamlined channel partner programme that brings more benefits to the channel and enable stronger business opportunities. Ruckus will also launch the ICX switching platform in the South African market. This deployment is key to enabling businesses to scale and future-proof their network infrastructure, to meet the increasing demand of wired and wireless network requirements. Furthermore, with regards to products, while I can’t give it all away right now, what I can say is that we have a whole sweep of products entrenched into the market which are expected to continue to perform exceptionally well.
