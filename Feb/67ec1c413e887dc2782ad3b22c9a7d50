Vodacom is implementing new customer care numbers to comply with the ICASA Number Plan Regulations. “Whilst the regulations are due to take effect on 24 March 2018, Vodacom will maintain a dual-run system, whereby customers will be able to use both the old and new numbers until such time that customers have familiarised themselves with the new numbers,” said Vodacom. “Thereafter, the old numbers will be decommissioned.” Customers can also use the My Vodacom App to access customer care services, recharge, and check airtime balances, said Vodacom. The new numbers are detailed in the table below.
