A mobile client for CryptoKitties is set to launch this year, Quartz reported. CryptoKitties is a crypto-collectible decentralised application built on the Ethereum blockchain which allows players to trade and breed virtual cats. Cats are sold and bred for cryptocurrency, and can be converted into real money by exchanging Ethereum for fiat currency. Speaking to Quartz, CryptoKitties cofounder Benny Giang said the CryptoKitties app will launch in China after 16 February. The mobile version of the game will roll out globally in the weeks following this release. While the browser version of CryptoKitties requires the MetaMask extension, the mobile app will reportedly have a built-in wallet.
