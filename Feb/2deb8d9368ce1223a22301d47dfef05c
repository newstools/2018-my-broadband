US President Donald Trump has suggested the level of violence in video games and movies should be addressed, reported CNN. Trump said something has to be done about what kids are seeing and how they are seeing it. “And also video games – I’m hearing more and more people say the level of violence in video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts,” said Trump. Trump added that the current movie age rating system does not adequately take violence into account, focusing instead on sexual content. Trump said a rating system which focuses on violence and killing for movies may have to be implemented.
