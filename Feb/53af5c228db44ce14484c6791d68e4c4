Bigelow Aerospace has announced the creation of a new venture named Bigelow Space Operations. The company will focus on selling Bigelow’s space habitats to customers, including private companies, NASA, and governments. Bigelow Aerospace attached its inflatable BEAM habitat to the International Space Station in 2016, where it was tested for habitation and is now used as a storage module. The company has also designed a standalone space station, which can be sent into orbit in a single launch. The B330 space station features 330m³ of internal space and is set to launch from 2021. Bigelow Space Operations will discuss the applications of space habitats with various corporate and government entities in an effort to sell the products.
