Discovery Bank is testing its capabilities with live testing of system infrastructure, operating processes, and regulatory engagement. This is according to the company’s interim results for the six months ended 31 December 2017. Discovery has spent R1.2 billion on Discovery Bank, and this is expected to reach R1.5 billion by launch. Discovery CEO Adrian Gore previously said South African banks are worried about Discovery’s entrance into the market, as it will be disruptive. “The value proposition itself will be good for customers. I mean, that is what we do,” said Gore. He said using incentives to change behaviour works well, and they can add value with their model of sharing value and creating behaviour change. Discovery Bank will target the “mass affluent market”, which Gore said covers “a low LSM right the way to the top”. The company confirmed that it has received its banking licence, along with: Discovery will launch its banking offering to the public during 2018.
