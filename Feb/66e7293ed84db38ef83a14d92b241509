Nando’s has launched an online campaign for Human Rights Day on 21 March dubbed #rightmyname. “We think it’s totally crazy that the tech we use every day still tells us that our names are a mistake,” it said. People may add their names to a database on the #rightmyname website, which Nando’s will use to release a digital dictionary of South African names. “Then, on 21 March this year, you’ll be able to update your spellcheck dictionary and get rid of the red line beneath your name – and the names of all your friends and family too.” <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
