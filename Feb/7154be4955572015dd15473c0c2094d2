Intel has released a new microcode update for Skylake processors to protect against the Spectre vulnerability, Ars Technica reported. Intel previously released patches for the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities, but asked manufacturers to stop installing them as they caused unexpected reboots and unpredictable behaviour. The new microcode update is being rolled out to manufacturers and will only apply to 6th-generation Skylake processors. Owners of processors based on other architectures will have to wait for more effective microcode updates.
