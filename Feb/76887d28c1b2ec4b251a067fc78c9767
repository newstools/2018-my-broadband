Bosch and Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler AG will test its self-driving taxis this year, Reuters reported. Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner told Automobilwoche that the companies would start testing their self-driving taxis within the next few months. The companies previously stated they would complete work on their self-driving taxis after 2020. The taxis will reportedly be designed around self-driving technology and will not be normal vehicles outfitted with autonomous driving technology.
