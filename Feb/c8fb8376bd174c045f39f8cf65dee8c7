Intel has started rolling out Spectre and Meltdown security updates for its 6th, 7th, and 8th-gen desktop processors. The manufacturer previously released a patch for Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities for its 6th-gen chips, but this patch was not compatible with newer desktop CPUs. Intel said its new updates will be made available through OEM firmware updates and will encompass all Core desktop chips from Skylake onwards, in addition to Xeon Scalable and Xeon D server processors. “On behalf of all of Intel, I thank each and every one of our customers and partners for their hard work and partnership throughout this process,” said Intel’s Navin Shenoy.
