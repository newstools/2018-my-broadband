HMD Global and Nokia have launched a refreshed version of the Nokia 3310, withÂ upgraded hardware to support 4G. The original Nokia 3310 featured a battery standby of up to a month, 22 hours of talktime, and 2G (GSM 900MHz/1,800MHz) support. In 2017, HMD Global unveiled the Nokia 3310 3G. The big change for the Nokia 3310 3G was talk time, which went from 22 hours for the 2G version to 6.5 hours on the 3G version. The Nokia 3310 4G will launch in China in February and will be available in light-blue and grey. It is not clear what battery life the 4G version will offer.
