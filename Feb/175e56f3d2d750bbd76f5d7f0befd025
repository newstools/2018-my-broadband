The Nokia 3 will soon test an upgrade to Android 8.0 in HMD Global’s beta lab, the company announced. Many of Nokia’s new Android smartphones are powered by Qualcomm chips, but the Nokia 3 runs on a MediaTek MT6737 1.3GHz quad-core processor. HMD Global previously told MyBroadband that it chose chips which are compatible with future releases of Android when designing its phones. The Nokia 3 was an exception, and MediaTek had to provide assurances that it will support Android 7.1.1 and beyond. “We told them they would not be the chipset provider if they do not support the latest software,” said the company. An upgrade to Android 8.0 for the Nokia 3 will go into testing in the coming weeks.
