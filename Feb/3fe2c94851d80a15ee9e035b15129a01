Samsung is looking for new buyers to offload organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays after Apple slashed production of its iPhone X due to weak demand, Nikkei reported. Apple has assured investors that demand for its iPhone X remain strong, but rumours persist that sales are not living up to expectations. The report states that Samsung increased its production capacity of OLED panels for the iPhone X and had hoped more manufacturers would adopt the technology after Apple. Manufacturers have elected to stick with cheaper LCD units, however, which Samsung also manufacturers and sells for nearly half the price of its OLED panels. According to the report, a Samsung OLED panel for a smartphone sells for around $100 – with the touch sensors included. OLED technology offers high resolutions, a wide colour gamut, and the ability to bend the display to narrow a phone’s bezel.
