Nokia is improving its Wi-Fi portfolio, following the announcement of its planned acquisition of Unium. The company said Unium specialises in “solving complex wireless networking problems” and its intelligent mesh wireless technology will complement Nokia’s home Wi-Fi solutions. “Unium’s software offers intelligent mesh, band steering, fast roaming, and a choice of Wi-Fi or Ethernet backhaul,” said Nokia. “The intelligent mesh network enables gigabit-plus capacity throughout the home.” Nokia said it will also introduce enhancements to its in-home Wi-Fi solutions, in conjunction with the Unium deal. The company said home Wi-Fi networks are under strain, due to the number of connected devices on a network – and its Wi-Fi solutions will solve this problem. Nokia will offer an extended portfolio with meshed Wi-Fi solutions that include a wide array of premium, flagship, and entry-level gateways and beacons. It will also introduce new software and embedded analytic functions that compile insights on the network, devices, and interference sources to “automatically self-heal and optimise the Wi-Fi experience”. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
