iPhones that receive messages with a specific Telugu character will likely crash, The Verge has reported. Telugu is a language from India. First discovered by Italian blog Mobile World, the bug causes many messaging applications to crash. Demonstrations of the bug in action show that the first time the message is received, the messaging app in question will crash and refuse to reopen. When the message is received while the app is closed, causing a notification to appear, the iOS Springboard will crash. Among other things, Springboard manages the iOS home screen. The Verge reported that several third-party apps are also susceptible to the bug. These include Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Gmail, and Outlook for iOS. Telegram and Skype do not appear to be affected.
