NASA’s Opportunity rover has been on Mars for 5,000 days as of this past weekend. A Martian day or “sol” lasts 40 minutes longer than a day on Earth, and Opportunity was only expected to last 90 days on the red planet. Opportunity was instrumental in providing NASA with evidence of water on Mars and has travelled over 45km from its landing site. The rover landed on Mars on 25 January 2004 and was not expected to survive the harsh Martian winter. The vehicle has experienced numerous problems, including a malfunctioning wheel and problems with a robotic arm, but continues to explore the surface. “Five thousand sols after the start of our 90-sol mission, this amazing rover is still showing us surprises on Mars,” said NASA.
