Airbus, Delta, OneWeb, Sprint, and Bharti Airtel have formed the Seamless Air Alliance, which aims to improve in-flight Internet access. The alliance wants mobile operators to extend their services into airline cabins, via satellite technology, to offer high-speed, low-latency connectivity. “It will also significantly reduce costs for everyone involved, while creating a smooth, positive user experience,” said the Seamless Air Alliance. This will be done by eliminating the immense costs associated with the acquisition, installation, and operation of data access infrastructure in planes.
