Senior ANC officials will meet with President Jacob Zuma today to discuss his fate, according to a report in the Sunday Times. The report stated that ANC deputy president David Mabuza will lead a delegation to Zuma’s official residence in Pretoria. It added that the meeting could also determine whether Zuma will deliver the state of the nation address scheduled for Thursday. “The ANC’s top six officials will meet Zuma this evening to discuss his exit,” stated the report. The delegation is reportedly working on instruction from the ANC’s national executive committee and the national working committee – both of which want Zuma gone as president. Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa is set to take over from Zuma, should he step down. It was recently reported that Zuma would retain his position as president of the country, with ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte insisting Zuma will not step down in 2018.
