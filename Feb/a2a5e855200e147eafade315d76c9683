If you are using an old smartphone and are having issues with WhatsApp, the reason may be the company’s end of support for certain devices. WhatsApp announced last year that BlackBerry OS and BlackBerry 10 devices will stop receiving updates at the end of 2017. Phones running Windows Phone 8.0 and older also stopped receiving support at the end of 2017. Android versions older than 2.3.3 and iOS 6 have not been supported since 2016. These devices no longer receive the latest versions of WhatsApp, and users on these smartphones cannot create new accounts or verify existing accounts. While WhatsApp may still work on these operating systems, the app may become unstable or no longer function as it was intended to.
