The January 2018 MyBroadband Speed Test results reveal that BitCo offers the highest average download speed, followed by iConnect and Vodacom. The results are based on over 310,000 speed tests performed on MyBroadband’s HTML 5 speed test platform. The speed tests include fixed-line, wireless, and mobile connections from ISPs, which means they can be representative of multiple technologies for a single ISP. An ISP which mainly offers 4Mbps ADSL products, for example, will be at a disadvantage against an ISP which only offers fibre services. According to the results, the average download speed in South Africa is 11.75Mbps, while the average upload speed is 6.9Mbps. The highest recorded result came from Converged Telecoms, which clocked a peak download speed of 4.3Gbps. The table below provides an overview of the average download speeds, upload speeds, and latency of South Africa’s prominent ISPs. Only ISPs with a minimum of 1,000 tests were considered for the results. Many ISPs have multiple IP ranges under different names, which is why certain ISPs appear twice in the list.
