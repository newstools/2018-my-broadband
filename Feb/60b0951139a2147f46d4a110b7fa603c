When iStore announced its South African pricing for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus on 13 October 2017, the rand was at R13.26 to the US dollar. In the months leading up to the local price announcement, the rand fluctuated between R12.80 and R13.80. The rand’s performance during 2017 was an issue for many South Africans looking to buy imported tech from international companies, including Apple products. When the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus launched in South Africa, the rand’s weakness was evident – with the entry-level model starting at R13,499. Apple iPhone 8 prices were as follows on 13 October 2017. In the weeks that followed the iPhone 8 launch in South Africa, the rand continued to weaken – peaking at around R14.47 in the middle of November 2017. Then the rand’s rally began, which was said to be the result of political change within the ANC. Our currency went from just under R14.50 to the dollar in November to R11.86 at the end of January 2018 – and has remained at around the R12.00 mark since. While tech lovers may think the strengthening rand is a cause for celebration, iPhone 8 pricing at the iStore has gone in the opposite direction. On 12 February 2018, with the rand still under R12.00 to the dollar, iPhone 8 and 8 Plus prices at the iStore were higher than they were in October 2017. Apple iPhone 8 prices on 12 February are listed below. Core, Apple’s Value Added Distributor for South Africa, was asked about the price increase, but did not provide feedback.
