Duduzane Zuma, Ajay Gupta, and Atul Gupta are all out of the country, long before a raid on the Gupta compound in Saxonwold. This is according to the Rapport newspaper, which said travel documents show Ajay Gupta left the country on 6 February and has not returned. It further showed that Duduzane Zuma, who may face criminal charges on his return, left for Dubai on 18 January. Zuma “bought an apartment worth nearly R18 million at the iconic skyscraper Burj Khalifa building in Dubai in 2015”, the Sunday Times reported. The Sunday Times added that Zuma tried to negotiate a deal with the Hawks, which delayed the Hawks’ raid on the Gupta compound. The delay reportedly may have helped the Gupta brothers evade arrest in South Africa. The Times of India reported that the Gupta brothers attended a Maha Shivratri procession in their home town Saharanpur in India on Wednesday. “Two of the three Gupta brothers attended the Shivratri procession,” stated the publication. In a follow-on report, it reported that Ajay Gupta was in Dehradun in northern India when South African president Jacob Zuma resigned. It reported that he came to Dehradun on 13 February after attending a wedding in Agra. “The Guptas have a palatial bungalow in Curzon Road in the city where Ajay is believed to have stayed till February 16, a day after the news of [Jacob] Zuma’s resignation broke out.” “During his stay in Dehradun, the businessman did not leave the bungalow and remained inside, the sources added.” It was reported that Gupta left Dehradun on Friday, via Jolly Grant Airport.
