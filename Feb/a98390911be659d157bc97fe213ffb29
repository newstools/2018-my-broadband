Key discussions between SA Rugby and SuperSport have resulted in SuperSport agreeing to waive radio broadcast rights fees for Super Rugby for the SABC . This follows the national broadcaster’s statement that it has financial challenges regarding the rights of Super Rugby and is unlikely to produce live radio broadcasts of the tournament. Mark Alexander, president of SA Rugby, emphasised that radio plays a critical role in informing rugby followers and duly asked for SuperSport’s support in this regard. “Frankly, it wasn’t a difficult discussion,” said Gideon Khobane, CEO of SuperSport. “We know and understand the realities of South Africa. Once Mr Alexander asked, we were happy to come to an arrangement.” Alexander said: “On behalf of all our rugby followers and SA Rugby, I’d like to thank SuperSport for this significant gesture. “They have worked with us and the SABC to find a solution to keep rugby on the radio airwaves and the waiving of the rights fee to which they are entitled is a significant step in that process. “The fear that rugby commentary might no longer be a feature of our listening experience is a very real and a very worrying one and I’d like to commend SuperSport for the leadership they have shown in this matter. “I trust that the SABC will now be able to reassure listeners that rugby commentary on Super Rugby, Currie Cup and Springbok Test matches will be a feature of their 2018 schedules.” Sport24
