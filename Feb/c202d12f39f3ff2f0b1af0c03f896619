“Last year was massively successful for us,” Shaun Durandt, general manager for HMD Global in Southern Africa, told MyBroadband. HMD Global has the licence to manufacture smartphones under the Nokia name, and the demand for new Nokia products has been overwhelming. From a startup business perspective, Durandt said it has been difficult to juggle the expectations on them with what they have planned in their roadmap. “Consumers don’t necessarily get that. They see a major brand like Nokia and they think, that’s a powerhouse, you can turn things on overnight,” he said. With that expectation comes responsibility and pressure. Although Nokia is a global brand, Durandt said they are going through a typical startup teething process. They also underestimated the strength of the Nokia brand around the world. Nostalgia going back 15 years years is difficult to quantify, but Durandt said the success of the new Nokia 3310 showed them where people’s hearts where. Although HMD Global is not disclosing sales figures, Counterpoint recently released revised numbers which show the company sold 4.4 million Nokia smartphones during the fourth quarter of 2017. After starting with a market share and global ranking of zero last year, Nokia now has 1% of the global market share and falls just outside the top 10 phone brands. Counterpoint said Nokia’s growth comes with performance in its most important market, India. The country is the second-largest mobile phone market in the world. “If HMD Global succeeds in the Indian market, it should drive Nokia up to among the top five phone brands globally.”
