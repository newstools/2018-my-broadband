South Africa’s award-winning film Inxeba (The Wound) will not be available on Netflix South Africa. Earlier in February, it was reported that the film would be shown on Netflix in the US. Netflix confirmed to MyBroadband that the film is only licensed for the US service and was never set to be available on the South African service. Inxeba was classified as X18 by the Film and Publication Board Appeal Tribunal this week, which means the only “legal” way to watch the film is by accessing it via “designated adult premises”. The film was set to show at cinemas across South Africa, and was originally rated as 16LS.
