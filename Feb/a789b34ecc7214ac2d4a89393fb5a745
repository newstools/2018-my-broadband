Amazon has promised that it will create 2,000 permanent contract positions in France this year, Reuters reported. The company said this will bring its total permanent staff complement in France to 7,500. This reflects its confidence in the economy of the country, where it has invested over €2 billion since 2010, said Amazon. France is Amazon’s third-largest market in Europe, after the United Kingdom and Germany. Amazon launched its Prime Now express delivery service in Paris in 2016 and has opened five logistics centres across the country. Earlier this month, Amazon also settled a long-running dispute with French tax authorities – which wanted nearly €200 million from the online retailer.
