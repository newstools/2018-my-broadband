The CEO of Volkswagen has stated that the company is “evolving into an SUV brand”. CEO Herbert Diess made the comment during the unveiling of a design for a VW SUV cabriolet based on the T-Roc. “The Volkswagen brand is launching its first convertible SUV. The new model is to be produced from the first half of 2020,” said VW. The company said the T-Roc is “setting new standards” in the compact SUV segment, and the new model will add to this movement. It added that by 2020, VW intends to expand its SUV range throughout the world to 20 models. “By then, about 40% of the vehicles sold by Volkswagen are to be SUV’s,” said VW.
