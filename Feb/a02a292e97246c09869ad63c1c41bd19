Japanese wood products company Sumitomo Forestry plans to build a 350m skyscraper in Tokyo. The 70-floor structure will be mostly constructed from wood, with only 10% of its composition being steel. The tower’s structural framework will be built from a combination of wood and steel, which can handle Japan’s seismic activity. The interior of the skyscraper will be made entirely of wood and boasts a floor space of 455,000m2. The company plans to construct the skyscraper in 2041 to mark its 350th anniversary.
