Axxess has increased the prices of its standalone capped Openserve accounts for end-users and resellers. The Internet service provider said the move is aimed at encouraging consumers to migrate to bundled packages, rather than use standalone services. When Axxess launched fibre-to-the-home services, it offered standalone fibre broadband accounts that could be used on an Openserve fibre line. This was in contrast to other ISPs, which all offered bundled accounts with lines at the time. Axxess also offered users standalone Openserve fibre lines. “We don’t sell standalone Openserve fibre accounts anymore,” Axxess told MyBroadband. “They have been removed from the website.”
