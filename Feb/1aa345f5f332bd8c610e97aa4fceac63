Data analytics is a field which will gain tremendous traction in 2018 and has the potential to change every industry – from agriculture to financial services. This is according to BCX CEO Ian Russell, who expects data analytics to emerge as the biggest trend in the IT industry this year. Russell is so bullish about the field that BCX is investing in expanding data analytics through its commitment to the Explore Data Science Academy. The academy provides a free one-year data science programme for South Africans to study data science and its applications. “We will be taking on 300 interns from this programme over the next three years and using their knowledge to provide enhanced services for our customers,” said Russell. Russell also believes that coding and STEM education for millennials will truly impact the ICT sector this year. “We firmly believe that coding should become South Africa’s 12th official language,” he said. “The youth in this country will be an invaluable resource for determining and developing the next generation of disruptive technology that will change the world.” The BCX CEO said they’ve found that millennials think differently – drawing upon skills they learn through hobbies like gaming, for example, to approach problems with a unique mindset. “Therefore, we’re focusing on recruiting young talent through our Insurgent League drive and supporting education through programmes like WeThinkCode,” he said.
