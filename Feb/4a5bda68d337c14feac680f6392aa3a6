The South African printing market has experienced a challenging past two years, but HP has shown strong growth in the country over this period thanks to its product range. This is according to HP South Africa MD David Rozzio, who said that while the total HPS Inkjet Market has seen a slight decline year-on-year, HP has seen growth in recent quarters. The reason for the growth was HP’s high-quality product line, which serves the needs of the local market better than other companies, said Rozzio. “The market is now more conscious about purchasing the right solution to meet their office environment,” he said. Popular HP products which helped bolster the company’s growth in South Africa were the HP LaserJet 402 and the HP Ink Advantage 4675. Despite the positive economic outlook for South Africa, Rozzio said they expect 2018 to be another tough year in the computing industry for Southern Africa. “Overall, we expect the market to contract by around 6.5% year-on-year,” he said. “Where we saw good growth in the commercial segment in 2017, we now expect the reverse for 2018.” Rozzio also expects the consumer market to shrink further by another 4% year-on-year.
