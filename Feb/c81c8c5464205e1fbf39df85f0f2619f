The South African telecommunications market will see many changes this year, which will impact most ICT companies. This is according to Webber Wentzel partner Nozipho Mngomezulu, who said ICASA is currently considering a number of issues and changes. These include: “It is unclear as to when these changes are likely to take effect, but from what we have observed, it seems that the changes are indeed imminent,” said Mngomezulu. Mngomezulu added that in the IT space, the most pertinent change will be the introduction of the Cybercrimes and Cybersecurity Bill. The Bill creates new criminal offences relating to cybercrimes and also sets out certain obligations which will need to be observed by financial institutions and telecoms providers, including in relation to reporting crimes and preserving information relating to cybercrimes. “In addition, POPI is also likely to come into effect. This will, of course, have a significant impact on how personal information is processed,” said Mngomezulu.
