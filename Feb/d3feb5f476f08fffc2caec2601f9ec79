AMD’s second-generation of Ryzen processors are expected to launch in South Africa later this month. Online retailers Wootware, Rebel Tech, and Evetech have listed local pricing for the AMD Ryzen 2200G and 2400G desktop chips – due for shipment in the coming weeks. The “G” designation refers to the chips’ integrated graphics cores, which are based on AMD’s Vega architecture. The new Ryzen chips are built on AMD’s refined Zen+ architecture and are compatible with AM4 motherboard sockets. AMD also announced it will begin shipping a new generation of Ryzen processors without integrated graphics in April. According to Wootware’s product listings, the Ryzen 2200G and Ryzen 2400G are expected to arrive in South Africa on 27 February 2018. The specifications and South African pricing of the desktop processors are below.
