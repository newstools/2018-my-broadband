Twitter has announced that it will no longer support its Mac desktop client. The company said this decision is a result of its effort to create a consistent experience across all platforms. Twitter announced that it will drop support for the Mac desktop client in 30 days, and the Twitter for Mac app is no longer listed in the Mac App Store. The company recommended that Mac users visit Twitter using a web browser instead.
