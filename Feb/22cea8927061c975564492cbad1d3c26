South Africa has a rich music scene, which boasts impressive artists, shows, and venues. An integral aspect of putting together a good track is a high-quality, controlled environment – such as Universal Music South Africa’s studios in Rosebank, Johannesburg. MyBroadband was lucky enough to visit the studios recently and sit in on a recording session with singer-songwriter Dominic Neill. Neill is a local artist who appeared on Idols SA, starred in the hit song Love You Still with DJ Kent, and released the album Out of My League. We also spoke to studio engineer Donovan Leon about the impressive technology and design behind the studio. From high-end analogue workstations to full live stages, Universal Music South Africa is packed with great tech and devices. The studio comprises neighbouring recording and control rooms, connected via a sophisticated cable routing system. This allows a studio engineer to control the sound from any of the recording rooms in the studio. The studio control rooms feature digital and analogue workstations, along with powerful desktop machines for audio processing and instruments for production work.            The studio’s recording rooms feature soundproofed walls and elevated floors to minimise vibrations and acoustic interference. The padded wall segments operate on hinges with wooden panels on the other side, allowing a studio engineer to tweak the acoustics of the room and produce the desired recording environment. Microphones and other recording hardware can also be swapped out, depending on the needs of the artist in session.     Neill was in session at Universal Studios and allowed us to sit in on the recording process.
