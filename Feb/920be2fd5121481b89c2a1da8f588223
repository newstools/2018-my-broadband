Israeli company Cellebrite can crack every iPhone, including ones running iOS 11, Forbes reported. In 2017, Cellebrite issued a statement in which it claimed it supports lawful unlocking and evidence extraction on iPhones – ranging from the iPhone 4s to the iPhone 6 Plus. The latest claim does not come from Cellebrite directly, with Forbes citing sources stating the company’s techniques were employed on an iPhone 8 and iPhone X. 9to5Mac suggested it is possible the Forbes report applies to exploits fixed in a recent update to iOS 11. Apple and Cellebrite did not comment on the reports.
