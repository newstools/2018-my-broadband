Amazonâ€™s Alexa assistant can now create and modify music playlists, TechCrunch reported. Users can ask Alexa to create a new playlist from a specific song and add tracks to different lists. Amazon said the ability to create and modify music playlists has been one of the most-requested features for Alexa, as many people are using their smart speakers to listen to music. The feature was recently introduced in beta and has now started rolling out to Amazon Alexa-enabled devices in the US.
