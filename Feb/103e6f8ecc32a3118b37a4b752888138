Point Topic has released its Q4 2017 residential broadband tariff report, which shows that South Africa is one of the most expensive countries globally when it comes to fixed-broadband prices. Point Topic’s scorecard compares the entry-level, median, and average residential broadband tariffs in 81 countries. The data includes fixed-broadband services offered over copper, cable, and fibre networks. “To help provide an easy way of comparing directly, we have taken the PPP data on entry-level, median, and average broadband tariffs, produced rankings, and then compared the variance,” it said. Venezuela had the lowest median broadband prices, followed by Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and Japan. South Africa ranks 69 out of 81 countries for its median residential broadband prices, which shows that we are paying higher prices for fixed-broadband access than most other countries. There was some good news, however. South Africa’s entry-level tariffs rank among the best in the world. Point Topic’s broadband tariff country scorecard is below, ranked according to the lowest median tariffs.
