Apple recently opened its $5-billion campus, but visitors are unlikely to see the inside of the main building, Business Insider reported. Shareholders and journalists were invited to the Steve Jobs Theatre on the campus before construction was completed, but they have not seen the inside of the “spaceship”. “The problem with opening up the main facility for tours is we have so much confidential stuff around. It’s sort of the bane of my existence to hold things confidential now,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook. Like its previous campus, Apple Park has a visitor’s centre, although it is across the road. It contains an Apple Store, a cafe, and an augmented reality experience of Apple Park. “If you haven’t been to this, I’d really encourage you to do it,” said Cook.
