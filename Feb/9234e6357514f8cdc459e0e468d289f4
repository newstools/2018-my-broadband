Matrix Warehouse unveiled its new branding and refreshed store look last year, and will build on this success in 2018, said the company. It currently has 84 stores across the country and is looking to expand its presence in Gauteng, Cape Town, KwaZulu-Natal, and Limpopo. Matrix Warehouse already has a strong presence in Gauteng, but it has identified three new locations in Johannesburg which will target more affluent buyers. It is not only the large cities which have enjoyed strong growth, however, as it said larger towns are becoming more productive – which is resulting in good growth. “The North West and Mpumalanga are definitely producing great growth, and Limpopo is following suit,” it said. The company also plans to carry more products in 2018. “A larger portfolio of products are being introduced and a wider range of components and peripherals are going to make Matrix Warehouse an even greater shopping experience to our clientele.” Matrix Warehouse has always focused on computing products, and has achieved success selling PCs, PC components, and peripherals. The gaming sector in particular has been a strong performer for Matrix Warehouse, which carries a wide range of gaming products. Another strong trend is portability, thanks to the increase in speed, battery life, and weight of portable computing products. This, in turn, has resulted in the growth of peripherals which are suitable for portable solutions. “Portable hard drives and flash memory are always in high demand,” said Matrix Warehouse. The company added that cryptocurrency mining has become wildly popular and sales of cryptocurrency mining components have more than quadrupled over the last year. “If there was more stock available, this would be our top-selling item,” it said.
