BlackBerry will remove paid software from the BlackBerry World store on 1 April, The Verge reported. This comes after the company announced it will continue support for BB10 and BBOS for at least two more years, but will close certain ancillary services. The BlackBerry World app store, BlackBerry Travel, and Playbook video calling will all be shut down. BlackBerry has now informed developers that all purchasing mechanisms for BlackBerry World will be disabled in April. Refunds for paid content will be supported until 30 April. If a developer does not make their app free before the deadline, BlackBerry will remove it from BlackBerry World. BlackBerry said apps can still be monetised, but developers will have to build payment backends into their apps.
