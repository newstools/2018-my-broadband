NASA has approved a 2020 launch window for Sierra Nevada’s Dream Chaser spacecraft. The spacecraft’s first mission will see it provide a cargo resupply to the International Space Station and return to Earth. The Dream Chaser is an automated cargo spaceplane which is launched into orbit on a rocket, such as the Atlas V or Falcon Heavy. Once its orbital mission is completed, the craft re-enters the atmosphere and lands on a runway. “Receiving NASA’s Authority to Proceed is a big step for the programme,” said Sierra Nevada. “We can’t wait to see the vehicle return to Kennedy Space Center to a runway landing, allowing immediate access to the science payloads being returned from the station.”
