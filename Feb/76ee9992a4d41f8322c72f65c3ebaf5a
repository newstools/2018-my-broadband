MTN has detailed its new short codes to comply with ICASA’s Number Plan Regulations. This follows Vodacom releasing its new codes earlier this week. “From 24 March 2018, the short codes that MTN customers use to check their airtime balance, retrieve voicemail messages, and to contact the call centre will be replaced with a new set of numbers,” said MTN. “The old and new codes will run concurrently, until MTN is comfortable our customers are at ease with the new system.” “The introduction of the harmonised short codes will make it easier and simpler for our customers to interact with us,” added MTN.
