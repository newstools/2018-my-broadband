MultiChoice has revealed its annual price adjustments for 2018, which will kick in on 1 April. The pay-TV broadcaster increases its prices in South Africa every year on the same day. As in 2017, DStv Access and DStv EasyView prices will not increase. MultiChoice has elected to increase its Access Fee price by nearly 6%, however, after leaving it unchanged last year. MultiChoice said it did its best to keep subscription fees down in 2017, despite the tough economic climate. “We’re committed to keep improving our offering so it gets better every year,” it said. This year, the economic climate has improved and the rand has strengthened significantly against the dollar – resulting in below-inflation increases.
