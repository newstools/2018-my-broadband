Bronco Combat Systems recently launched the BRONCO II, which the company said will revolutionise the light-attack and tactical aircraft industry. The BRONCO II is based on the AHRLAC aircraft, which is designed and built at the Wonderboom Airport in Pretoria. The BRONCO II is a two-crew C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) and precision strike aircraft. It is capable of carrying a wide range of weapons, sensors, and systems in extended airborne missions. Is makers said it is a platform that is built for purpose, uses a pusher propeller, and has an open system architecture. This allows for the rapid incorporation of current and emerging systems. “The fact that the aircraft is 100% digitally-designed makes the ability to industrialise the BRONCO II in its totality in the United States a reality,” said the company. “Work has started on establishing a manufacturing base that will enable the full production of the airframe and mission systems integration in the United States.” The BRONCO II’s internal Interchangeable Multi-Mission System Bay (IMSB) also allows a single airframe to be rapidly reconfigured to perform multiple roles. It incorporates high-performance targeting sensors, network communication systems, precision weapons, an electronic self-protection suite, and mission planning systems. The BRONCO II also operates at a fraction of the procurement and lifecycle cost of an aircraft with similar mission applications and capabilities.
