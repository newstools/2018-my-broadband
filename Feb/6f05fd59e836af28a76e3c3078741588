Ericsson expects strong growth in sub-Saharan Africa and is looking to expand its presence in the region. This is according to Jonathan Adams, head of Ericsson in South and East Africa. The company recently partnered with MTN to conduct the first 5G technology and applications trial in Africa, which Adams said illustrates its dedication to the region. According to Ericsson’s latest Mobility Report, mobile subscriptions in sub-Saharan Africa are expected to grow by 6% between 2017 and 2023. This means that mobile subscriptions in the region will increase from the current 700 million to 990 million by 2023. “This indicates the great potential we see for these markets and we would love to expand with customers,” said Adams. Competition in the mobile networking market is fierce, with players like Huawei, ZTE, and Nokia all fighting for market share. Adams believes Ericsson’s customer-first approach, with a consultative culture, makes them an attractive choice to network operators. “The width of expertise, experience, and talents are also key strengths which make Ericsson stand out from the crowd,” said Adams. Adams said South Africa is one of the most developed telecoms markets in Africa, which as a whole is witnessing rapid growth in mobile uptake and connectivity. As such, operators are facing greater network demands – with voice and data demands increasing. For South Africa in particular, where smartphone penetration is much higher than other African countries, telecommunications requirements are more advanced, said Adams. “We can therefore expect to see a greater increase in data usage in particular, as users become more keen to use social networks, stream videos, and consume digital media.” Adams said the strong data growth bodes well for the affordability and inclusiveness of mobile services in South Africa.
