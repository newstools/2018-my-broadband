Vodacom has stopped listing its Smart S, M, L, and XL contract tariff plans on its website, leading to speculation the operator had discontinued them. Non-plus variants of its Red plans are also no longer listed, while Red Select+, Red Classic+, Red Premium+, and Red VIP+ are still available on the Vodacom website. Its Smart More Data and Red More Data 10GB plans are also still listed. Upon contacting the operator’s retail outlets, however, agents told MyBroadband they still offered the contracts to clients who ask for them. Vodacom confirmed it had not discontinued the plans, but streamlined its website. “Feedback from some online customers is that there are too many options to choose from with the Smart Plans and the Smart Plus plans included in the various menus,” said Vodacom. “Hence, we are trialling a streamlined menu that includes the most popular packages among online shoppers.”
