Intel has unveiled its Vaunt smart glasses, which look like normal prescription glasses. Intel’s Vaunt smart glasses have no LCD screen, no camera, no buttons, and no gesture control. All the electronics are located in two small modules in the stems of the glasses to ensure the eyewear remains well balanced and light. Instead of an LCD screen, the Vaunt smart glasses use retinal projection – which “paints” an image into the back of a user’s retina. Jerry Bautista, the lead for the team building wearable devices at Intel, told The Verge that “we use a holographic grading embedded into the lens to reflect the correct wavelengths back to your eye”. According to The Verge, Intel will launch an “early access programme” for its Vaunt smart glasses later this year.
