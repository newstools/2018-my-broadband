Instagram is testing a feature that shows when someone has taken a screenshot of your Story, TechCrunch reported. Those participating in the trial don’t get a specific notification when someone takes a screenshot, but they can see a new camera shutter logo in the list of names of story viewers. Instagram acknowledged the test and said it is always working on ways to improve the platform. TechCrunch noted that rolling out screenshot alerts would effectively align Instagram with Snapchat, with screenshots in a direct message causing a notification to be shown to the sender, while screenshots of stories are shown in the list of viewers.
