Hisense is in discussions to offer FIFA World Cup coverage in South Africa through an app on select TV models, Hisense South Africa GM Youbo Li told MyBroadband. The company announced its partnership with Fox earlier this year to offer the Fox Sports 2018 FIFA World Cup app on its TVs. This will give Hisense TV owners access to Fox Sports’ World Cup content, which comprises multiple digital feeds, including multiple live viewing angles during games. It will offer live games and near real-time highlights from 37 customisable camera angles in 4K and HDR. In the US, the app will be preloaded onto qualifying smart TVs between March and May. The app’s live streaming features will launch on 14 June 2018, when Russia hosts Saudi Arabia in the opening game of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. 21st Century Fox and Cell C announced their partnership for South Africa in 2017. The deal includes live streaming of seven channels, including Fox Sports and Fox Sports 2. Cell C will also offer the Fox+ on-demand video catalogue on its Black platform as part of the deal. “We are currently in discussions with Cell C, but our touchpoint is Fox,” said Li. Li said there are many companies involved, however, and they will also have to negotiate with DStv to make a deal. If there is anything concrete to report from the discussions, it will be announced, said Li.
