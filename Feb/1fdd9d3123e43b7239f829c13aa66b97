Netflix is redesigning the user interface of its Android mobile app, Android Police reported. The company is reportedly rolling out the new version of its Android app to beta testers. The new version sports a bottom navigation bar instead of the left drop-down menu, and an improved Search page. Categories have also been moved to within the search page, and the More section allows users to change settings and manage their accounts. There is currently no official release date for the new version of Netflixâ€™s Android app.
