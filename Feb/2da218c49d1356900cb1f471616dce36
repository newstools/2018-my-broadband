HMD Global has unveiled the Nokia 1, a new low-cost Android smartphone which runs Android 8.1 Go. Android Go ships with a rebuilt set of Google’s popular apps and a version of Google Play that highlights apps designed to work best on smartphones with 1GB or less of RAM. With this version of Android Go, Google also includes features to control and monitor data usage, along with the security improvements featured in Android 8.1. Nokia said that with the Go edition of Android, users will also have about 50% more storage free than with standard Android. The Nokia 1 comes with a “pure, secure, and always up-to-date” Android experience, meaning no unwanted apps (bloatware), and regular security patches and feature upgrades delivered. On the hardware side, the device is wrapped in a rigid and durable polycarbonate shell, meaning scuffs and scratches will not mar the finish of the device. The Nokia 1 also has an FM radio and features an IPS screen, which Nokia said provides a crisp display and efficient battery usage. The Nokia 1 will be available in white and dark blue from April 2018 at a recommended retail price of $85.
