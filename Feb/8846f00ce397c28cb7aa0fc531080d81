WeThinkCode has started its first selection boot camp in Cape Town, following the opening of its campus in the city. WeThinkCode is a two-year programming and coding course aimed at addressing the scarcity of programmers and developers in South Africa. The initiative’s first campus was opened in Johannesburg and has proven to be a great success. The Cape Town campus aims to replicate this success, and it recently partnered with BCX to expand its presence in South Africa. WeThinkCode’s boot camp in Cape Town aims to find the country’s next top developers, who will enrol in its programming course if selected. “We are hosting two more selection boot camps in March and April at our new campus situated at Workshop17 Portswood at the V&A Waterfront. Our Cape Town cohort 2018 applications are open until 31 March 2018,” said WeThinkCode. Images from the Cape Town boot camp are posted below.
