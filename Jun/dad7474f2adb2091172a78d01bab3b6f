Telkom has no plans to challenge new regulations from ICASA regarding data expiry and out-of-bundle billing. However, the company has left open a review it lodged on a previous amendment to the End-User and Subscriber Charter Regulations. ICASA amended provisions in the regulations in 2009 and 2016 which deal with minimum fault clearance timeframes for fixed-line service providers. In a statement contained in its recent annual results, Telkom said that following an ICASA Complaints and Compliance Committee ruling, it initiated administrative review proceedings to set aside the applicability of the relevant regulations. In a response to questions, Telkom confirmed to MyBroadband the statement in its annual results only referred to amendments made to the End-User and Subscriber Charter Regulations in 2009, and not the most recent changes which deal with data expiry and OOB billing. Regarding its challenge of the 2009 amendments, Telkom said the review application is in process and no hearing date has been allocated yet. “In the interim, however, ICASA promulgated the Amended End-User and Subscriber Charter Regulations on 1 April 2016.” Under the amended terms of the regulations, fault handling measurements for fixed services was changed to 90% fault clearance within five days, instead of three days. “Telkom is assessing the impact of the amended regulations going forward,” said the company.
