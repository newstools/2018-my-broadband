SEACOM’s enterprise division has gained over 3,000 new enterprise customers across Kenya and South Africa, more than doubling its customer base in a year. SEACOM Business is also delivering more than 150 new services across Africa each month. This is according to SEACOM CEO Byron Clatterbuck, who made the statements in a media release. The company’s enterprise offerings include fibre Internet access, which ranges from 25Mbps to 1Gbps in speed – depending on the region. A driver behind the division’s impressive growth was the establishment of new interconnect agreements with last-mile suppliers and securing wireless network access in areas without fibre. SEACOM also recently acquired MacroLan, which strengthened its fibre Internet access business. The company said it is currently evaluating several other acquisitions, focussing on urban areas in South Africa and Kenya. “Across South Africa and Kenya, we’re seeing great adoption of our fibre connectivity as well as of our private and outsourced network solutions,” said Clatterbuck. “We have encountered enormous pent-up demand for high-speed connectivity and quality bandwidth at an affordable cost.”
