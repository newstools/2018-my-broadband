Huawei has seen a 60% increase in the sales of its P20 series over its previous-generation P10 series, the company stated. These figures refer to the six weeks following the release of the Huawei P20 in South Africa. Sales of the P20 Lite have increased by a 150% compared to the P10 Lite over the same period, and the sales numbers for the Huawei P20 series for April 2018 surpassed that of the Samsung Galaxy S9, said Huawei. “The Huawei P series has established itself as the benchmark of exquisite design and best-in-class photography,” said Huawei CBG vice president Likun Zhao. “With the P20 series, Huawei has brought to market devices that revolutionise the use of innovative technology and premium design. The smartphone lineup has also been successful internationally, with Google Trends revealing the Huawei P20 series was a frequent search query across Europe. Huawei added that in the four weeks since the launch of the Huawei P20 Pro, it had outsold its predecessor by 316%. This helped make it the most successful device ever sold by the company in Western Europe.
