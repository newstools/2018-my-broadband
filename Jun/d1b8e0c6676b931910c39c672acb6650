Steam has upgraded its chat system, introducing a number of new features – such as inline media and saved groups. The new features are available to try out in a dedicated beta programme, which is accessible via the Settings > Account menus. With the new chat platform, in-game friends are grouped by the game they are playing and parties within that game, and the persistent group chats mean users can start a dedicated voice channel for their friends. Users can also invite friends to groups by sending a URL to them, which will automatically add them to the group. The platform’s voice chat backend has also been reworked to improve voice quality and latency.
