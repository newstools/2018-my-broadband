Standard Bank’s Internet banking channel and its mobile app are down, according to several reports from users. When tested by MyBroadband, Standard Bank’s Internet banking channel via a Chrome browser on PC was not allowing users to log in to their banking profile. The Standard Bank iOS and Android apps were also returning error messages when tested. After entering your login details and trying to access an account, the iOS app returned the following message: “We are experiencing technical problems processing your request”. Reports of Standard Bank downtime on Down Detector also started spiking at around 09:00 this morning. The problems may be a headache for certain users, as today – 25 June 2018 – is “payday” for many companies, with employees requiring their salaries and wages to be paid. The latest downtime follows extended downtime from the bank in March 2018, where the inability to access online services was blamed on “technical problems”.
