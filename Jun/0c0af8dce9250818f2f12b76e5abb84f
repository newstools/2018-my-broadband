Microsoft announced it is using artificial intelligence to improve the quality and reliability of its Windows 10 updates. The company said its AI selects devices that would have the best experience moving to the April 2018 update and offers the update to them first. “As our rollout progresses, we continuously collect update experience data and retrain our models to learn which devices will have a positive update experience, and where we may need to wait until we have higher confidence in a great experience,” said Microsoft. Microsoft first trialed its AI-based rollout during the Windows 10 Creator’s Update and saw impressive results and smoother upgrade experiences. Over 250 million PCs have upgraded to the April 2018 update, and the company said it is seeing higher satisfaction numbers and lower support interactions compared to previous releases of Windows 10.
