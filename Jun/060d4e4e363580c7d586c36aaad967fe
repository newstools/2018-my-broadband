Messages on social media are calling on South Africans to shut down all major roads in protest over recent petrol price hikes and VAT increases. As reported by the Sandton Chronicle, South Africans have expressed their displeasure with the price hikes by calling for protest action on 2 July 2018. Reports of the strike’s proposed effect vary wildly, with some circulating social media posts warning that shops, police stations, and hospitals will be blocked. Other posts said drivers should block major roads and highways to aid the strike action. “We are urging all taxi owners, bus owners, trucks owners, and small vehicle owners from all over the country to take part by parking their vehicles in the roads,” stated one message. Some messages are demanding that petrol and diesel prices be decreased to R5 per litre, along with a lowering of VAT to 10%. Messages calling for strike action are also reportedly spreading across WhatsApp groups.
