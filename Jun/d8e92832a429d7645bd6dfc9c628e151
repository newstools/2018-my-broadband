The Wi-Fi alliance has officially launched the WPA3 security standard, offering improved password authentication and cryptographic strength. WPA3 is built on the WPA2 standard and retains interoperability with WPA2-supported devices, while disallowing outdated security protocols. The standard is currently an optional certification for wireless devices, but will become a requirement as adoption of the improved protocols increases. WPA3-Personal replaces WPA2â€™s Pre-Shared Key (PSK) protection with Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), which is more resistant to offline dictionary attacks and provides more robust password-based authentication. This allows users to pick passwords which are easier to remember and protects data traffic even if a password is compromised after the data was transmitted. WPA3-Enterprise includes 192-bit minimum-strength security protocols for increased protection of sensitive data. The WPA3 security standard will become available on new Wi-Fi Certified devices this year.
