Here at ESET, we are proud to say we are a privately held company. No rounds of VC funding. No IPOs. No investors. We’re not subject to the whims of the market or any investors. We’re focused on one thing: building the best security technology for our customers.  With that goal, ESET has been built into a company into what is now the fifth largest endpoint security vendor in the world. ESET was founded, and is still privately held, by people who live and breathe technology every day. The journey started in 1987 when two young men—Peter Paško and Miroslav Trnka—built one of the earliest ESET prototypes while working out of their home. A few years later, they formally launched ESET in Slovakia (a member of the European Union). Now, with a presence in more than 200 countries, of course including South Africa, and territories, ESET has some of the world’s most iconic companies as clients who trust ESET to protect them from cyberattacks. As a privately held, financially stable company with zero debt, we serve our customers, not investors. We have become known for our commitment to malware research (all published on our award-winning security blog, welivesecurity.com) conducted by some of the top minds in the industry, as well as our 30 years of innovation in effective security solutions. We are honoured to protect more than 600 million devices worldwide and will continue serve our customers with passion, reliability and integrity. This article was published in partnership with ESET.
