Halo and Destiny developer Bungie has announced a partnership with Chinese company NetEase. NetEase invested $100 million in the developer, granting it a minority stake and a seat on its board of directors. Bungie said the partnership with NetEase would allow the company to explore new directions. “With their industry expertise, they’ll empower us to build new worlds and invite players, new and old, to join us there,” said a Bungie spokesperson. Destiny owners will remain unaffected and Bungie plans to grow the title for years to come, said the company. The latest title in the Destiny series is Destiny 2, which is the first version of the game available on PC.
