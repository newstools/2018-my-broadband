Tesla will roll out an update for the autopilot software in its cars during August, which will enable full sell-driving capabilities, said CEO Elon Musk. According to The Verge, Musk’s announcement puts Tesla on track to make good on his promise to offer full self-driving in their cars by 2019. It is not clear what “full self-driving capabilities” means, however, and Tesla declined to provide further comment on Musk’s statements. The Verge reported that enabling the full-driving feature in a Tesla could cost $3,000 on top of the $5,000 “Enhanced Autopilot” option.
