Google Maps users on Android have started reporting seeing features similar to what Waze offers, stated Android Police. Google acquired Waze five years ago for $966 million to use its technology to enhance its Maps app. In 2017, Google introduced a feature into Maps to remember where you parked your car, for example, a feature which existed in Waze. Waze’s social features which allow its users to report hazards, police checkpoints, and traffic problems, remained exclusive to its app, however. Google has used incident data from Waze in Google Maps since November 2013, but has not allowed its users to interact with the reports. This appears to be changing, with Maps users reporting they are prompted to confirm whether an incident reported in Waze is still accurate. However, based on the screenshots of the feature, Maps will still not allow its users to report incidents.
