An update to news cards in Google Feed has enabled dedicated topic pages with related articles, 9to5Google reported. Rebranded from Google Now cards to Google Feed in 2017, it was always possible to tap the top of a news card where the topic is listed to perform a search for more articles. The update introduces a right-pointing chevron next to the name of the topic, which opens a list of cards with related articles when you tap on it. Tapping on the topic image when you open the related articles still performs a Google search. According to the report, the update has been seen in older versions of the Google app as far back as version 8.1, through to the current beta version (8.6).
