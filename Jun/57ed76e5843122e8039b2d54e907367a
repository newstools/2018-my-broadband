Keepsafe has launched a new privacy-focused mobile web browser for iOS and Android. The company provides a number of privacy-centric products, including a private photo app, a VPN app, and a private phone number generator. Its new mobile browser offers an array of features to protect user identity when surfing the web. The browser can be locked with a PIN or biometric authentication, and features secret tabs which do not save browsing history, cookies, or recent URLs. Keepsafeâ€™s mobile web browser also includes native tracker blockers, which block trackers embedded in adverts, social networks, analytics, and other content. Cookies and caching are retained when browsing in normal tabs, however, allowing you to stay logged in to services such as social media platforms. Keepsafe Browser is available from the Google Play Store for Android and the App Store for iOS.
