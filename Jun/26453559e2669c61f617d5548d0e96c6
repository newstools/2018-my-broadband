Microsoft has started rolling out its Avatar Editor app to Xbox Insiders. The feature was unveiled in 2017, and allows users to create a new Xbox Avatar from a wide selection of cosmetic options. Options include 16 million colour combinations, emote captures, and various accessories – such as nose rings and clothing. After users have finished building their new avatar, they will be able to take a picture of it and set it as their Gamerpic. If users prefer their old pictures, they also have the option to retain their original Xbox avatar as their Gamerpic. “The new Xbox Avatars are built from the ground up to enable an unprecedented amount of inclusive customisation options, and we will continue to grow these selections over time,” said Microsoft.
