Upload functionality on The Pirate Bay appears to have been broken for several days, TorrentFreak reported. Several VIP uploaders have reported the problem, stating they receive an “Error – Empty File” notice regardless of what they try to upload to the platform. Moderators of The Pirate Bay forums have pointed people to The Pirate Bay status page, which shows that everyone on the platform is experiencing the same issue. One moderator said the problem will be resolved in due course. According to the report, The Pirate Bay was been experiencing technical issues regularly, with the site going down every two weeks for a few hours or days, only to reappear as normal.
