Apple has released the public beta of iOS 12, macOS Mojave, and tvOS 12. “As a member of the Apple Beta Software Program, you can take part in shaping Apple software by test-driving pre-release versions and letting us know what you think,” said Apple. The beta versions of the software are not recommended for a user’s primary Apple devices, as they may contain bugs which can lead to the software not functioning optimally. In iOS 12, Apple has promised improved augmented reality experiences, along with new Siri shortcuts, a Screen Time device usage monitor, and an improved FaceTime app. The final version of iOS 12 is set to be released before the end of 2018, said Apple.
