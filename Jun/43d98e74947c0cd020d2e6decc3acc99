LinkedIn has launched a Your Commute feature which shows users the travel time to a potential new job. Travel time to work is a consideration for people when looking for a new job, which is why LinkedIn launched this feature. Users who visit LinkedIn’s job listing on their mobile phone will start to see the new “See Your Commute” module. “From here, you can enter your address to calculate how long it would take you to get to your new office walking, driving, or on public transportation,” said LinkedIn. “Soon, you’ll also have the option to save your location information locally on your phone so you don’t have to type it in every time you’re looking at a role.” Users will also be able to set their commute preferences in their Career Interests dashboard, which will help LinkedIn to better target jobs at them.
