MyBroadband has received numerous complaints about poor upload speeds on the Rain network, which was confirmed by MyBroadband’s own network testing. One consumer informed MyBroadband that he has been experiencing very slow upload speeds since Tuesday. “My upload speed used to be 12Mbps or faster, but it has dropped to 0.28Mbps,” he told MyBroadband. His ISP advised him to contact Rain’s call centre for network-related problems, but this did not help much as they told him to “wait until they come back to him”. “They seem to be missing the point with their poor client service, and it seems as if they do not have a clue,” he said. This is not an isolated event, and many Rain subscribers have complaints about the same problem. “Rain’s upload speeds are abysmal – quite often it is 0.01Mbps which is essentially useless. Speed tests often fail to complete due to uploads never finishing,” another user said. MyBroadband’s network testing showed that Rain experienced a significant drop in upload speed over the last week. Rain CEO Willem Roos told MyBroadband that the company will have to investigate this issue in more detail. “In these cases it could be that the subscribers are on a cell edge, or in an indoor area where our coverage is not great yet,” Roos said. The graph below shows Rain’s average upload speed (in kbps) over the last week, based on MyBroadband mobile speed tests across the country. In many areas the average upload speed was well below 1Mbps.
