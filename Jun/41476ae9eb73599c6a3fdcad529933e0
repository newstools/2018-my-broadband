Samsung Electronics has announced the highest-capacity NVMe solid state drive (SSD) available currently — an 8TB drive based on the Next-Generation Small Form Factor (NGSFF). NGSFF, or NF1,  is the latest standard for SSDs which Samsung said is expected to be standardised by JEDEC in October. It succeeds the M.2 standard, and can more than double the space utilization within server systems. According to Samsung, its new 8TB NVMe NF1 SSD has been optimised for data-intensive analytics and virtualisation applications in data centers and enterprise server systems. The new SSD uses 16 Samsung 512GB NAND packages, which are each stacked in 16 layers of 256 gigabit 3-bit V-NAND chips. Samsung said the NF1 SSD is expected to quickly replace conventional 2.5-inch NVMe SSDs by enabling up to three-times the system density in existing server infrastructure, allowing for 576TB of storage space in the latest 2U rack servers. The company said it plans to launch a version which uses 512Gb 3-bit V-NAND-based chips in the second half of this year to accommodate faster processing for big data applications.
