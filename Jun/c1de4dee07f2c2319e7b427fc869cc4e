A number of video game publishing companies have removed support for the RedShell SDK following backlash from gamers, Bleeping Computer reported. Users on Steam and Reddit recently noticed that many publishers had embedded the SDK in their titles, and began filing complaints with developers. The RedShell SDK allows gaming companies to log the source of new game installs and run social marketing programmes using affiliate IDs. However, gamers said the SDK was also being used to collect information about their online activity and the hardware in their gaming rigs. Following the backlash, a number of companies agreed to remove the SDK â€“ including the publishers behind Elder Scrolls Online, Conan Exiles, Total War, and My Time at Portia. Games which are still using the RedShell software include Civilization VI, Kerbal Space Program, Injustice 2, and Sniper Ghost Warrior 3.
