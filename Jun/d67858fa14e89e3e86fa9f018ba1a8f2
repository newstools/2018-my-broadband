New BCX CEO Jonas Bogoshi said BCX wants to partner with cloud providers as part of its plan to “reverse declining call revenue and grow its service offering”. This is according to the City Press, which quoted Bogoshi as saying they want to partner with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google. On 1 June, BCX CEO Ian Russell announced in an email to staff that he was leaving the company. Russell said he aims to work more broadly within the industry, but agreed to stay on in his position for a few months to ensure a seamless handover and to work on critical initiatives. Telkom Group CEO Sipho Maseko then announced the new CEO of BCX will be Jonas Bogoshi. “Jonas joined our business in April and has extensive experience in the areas that BCX is looking to grow, including the public sector – which makes up 35% of BCX’s revenue,” said Maseko. “He has also worked for technology giants such as T-Systems, SITA, Cisco, and IBM South Africa, and is former CEO of Gijima.” The announcement followed a weak performance from BCX over the past 12 months, with public sector revenue dropping by R1.6 billion. Telkom said BCX’s performance was negatively impacted by both the weak economy and the decline in voice revenue from the connectivity business. “As a traditional technology, voice is impacting our businesses across the group with customers migrating from circuit voice to voice over internet protocol,” said Telkom. “We have strategies to manage the decline in voice revenue while we migrate customers to VoIP and grow new revenue streams through focused investment in areas of future potential growth.” Bogoshi said he also wants to grow BCX’s cyber security, IoT, and data analytics arms. He revealed that after leaving BCX, Russell “will play a role at Telkom with its CEO, Sipho Maseko”.
