Rain Mobile ended its Beta Programme on 4 June in preparation for its commercial launch. “We do not want to give too much away, but let’s just say we’ll be live with our commercial offering before you know it,” the company told beta testers. “Unfortunately, this exciting news means the end of the Beta Programme, so on the evening of 4 June 2018 your rain Beta SIM/SIMs will be deactivated.” Rain Mobile encouraged its Beta Programme users to keep an eye out for its launch announcement via social media channels. Rain Mobile CEO Willem Roos told MyBroadband last month that they are currently expanding their LTE-Advanced network into metro areas, which was progressing well. Roos told MyBroadband that given the “inherent uncertainties” involved in the launch of a new business, however, he did not want to provide a specific launch date for its products. While details of the final packages Rain Mobile will offer are yet to be released, the company previously stated it will provide “innovative pricing tariffs” to customers. Roos previously said his aim at Rain Mobile is to build a business that brings affordable Internet to many South Africans. “We are also working on ensuring that we have good coverage in high-traffic malls,” said Roos. The company declined to comment on potential roaming agreements with other mobile networks when asked.
