Leading ICT infrastructure and smart device provider Huawei presented its cloud platform at the 2018 MyBroadband Cloud, Hosting, and Security Conference, which took place at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand on 13 June. Their cloud platform enables enterprises and organisations to take significant steps toward digital transformation. “Coming from a device background, Huawei has a strong networking presence, but few people are aware of our cloud capabilities.” said Muhammed Seedat, Huawei Technologies IT Director. “By being here today, it allows us the opportunity to bring Huawei to the cloud customers out there, such that they can tell the customers they’re serving as well as potential customers what we are up to, and give them a clear picture of the strength and depth of the platform.” The MyBroadband Cloud Conference provides IT executives, managers, and business owners from various industries a platform to interact and do business with South Africa’s top cloud and hosting providers.
