New benchmarks for the MacBook Pro “14.3” on Geekbench suggest Apple may be working on a new model in its professional laptop range. The laptop is set to run hexa-core Intel Core i7-8750H and 32GB of RAM, SlashGear reported. The “14.3” model corresponds to the 15-inch variant launched in 2017, but the specifications are significantly higher. In addition to an upgraded MacBook Pro, Apple is also expected to unveil a “dark mode” for macOS. Developer Steve Troughton-Smith discovered a leaked video of Xcode, Apple’s integrated development environment for macOS, showing a new version of the tool running on macOS in dark mode. SlashGear noted that the Mac App Store does not yet support videos. As the leak appeared to be a video preview intended for the Mac App Store, it is possible Apple will launch video trailers for the app store at WWDC 2018.
