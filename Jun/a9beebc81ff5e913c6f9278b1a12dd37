Amazon has announced that its CloudFront Global Network has two new Edge locations. The new CloudFront PoPs are in Johannesburg, South Africa and Bangalore, India. “The Edge location in Johannesburg is Amazon CloudFront’s first PoP on the African continent. The addition of these two locations brings CloudFront’s global network to 119 Points of Presence in 58 cities, across 26 countries,” said Amazon. Amazon Web Services established its presence in South Africa with a Development Center in Cape Town in 2004, said the company. “Since then, AWS has expanded its presence in South Africa by launching Direct Connect in December 2017, and today adds its first CloudFront Edge location in Johannesburg.” The move improves the availability and performance of content delivery to viewers in the region, and customers who use Amazon CloudFront to reach viewers in South Africa “will see performance improvements of as much as 75% from reduction in latency for their content delivery”. “We’re also happy to announce that Amazon CloudFront will be launching another Edge location in Cape Town in the coming weeks,” said Amazon. The Edge locations also bring Lambda@Edge, Field Level Encryption, and Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration, as well as seamless integration with other AWS services like AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), AWS Shield, AWS WAF, AWS Simple Storage Service (S3), and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), added the company.
