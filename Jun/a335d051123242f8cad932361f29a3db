Bing has launched new intelligent visual search capabilities which makes it possible to search the web using your smartphone camera. The new visual search capabilities are initially only available in the United States on the Bing app for iOS and Android, and for Microsoft Launcher (Android only). These features are also being rolling out for Microsoft Edge for Android and will be coming soon to Microsoft Edge for iOS and Bing.com. To use Bing’s new visual search capabilities, users can take a photo using the Bing app or upload a photo from their camera roll. Bing will identify the object in question and give you more information by providing additional links to explore. Bing’s new visual search capabilities also allow users to shop from their photos for fashion and home furnishings. “Let’s say you see a friend’s jacket you like, but don’t know its brand or where to purchase. Upload a pic into the app’s search box and Bing will return visually-similar jackets, prices, and details for where to purchase,” Microsoft said. The video below shows Bing’s visual search capabilities in action.
