Neil Smith is one of South Africaâ€™s most successful ecommerce entrepreneurs, having founded Take 2 and Raru. Take 2, which was started in 2002, was acquired by Tiger Global Management in October 2010. It was then rebranded as Takealot in June 2011. After waiting for his restraint of trade to pass, he and several Take 2 partners founded Raru in June 2014. We are giving you an opportunity to ask Neil anything about ecommerce.
