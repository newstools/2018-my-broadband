To supply 1,400 delegates simultaneously with free Wi-Fi services is a challenging task, especially when many people have multiple connected devices. This is exactly what MySky Networks and WiFi-It Events achieved at the 2018 MyBroadband Cloud Conference, however, which took place at the Gallagher Convention Centre on 13 June 2018. The conference had over 1,400 delegates in the speaking hall at its peak, with many more delegates visiting the expo area. All of these delegates enjoyed excellent, free connectivity via MySky Networks and WiFi-It Events’ wireless network at the event. This was achieved using the latest Wi-Fi and networking technologies, and the company’s expertise in the events space.  Antfarm, which specialises in live digital content delivery on any platform to any device in the world, partnered with MyBroadband as the streaming partner for the event. It provided thousands of people who could not attend the conference with uninterrupted streaming of all the presentations via YouTube, Facebook, and its own streaming platform. The company has also made the presentations available online, which can be viewed free of charge.
