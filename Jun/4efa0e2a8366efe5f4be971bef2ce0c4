Deputy Minister of Communications Pinky Kekana has called technology “a gift from God”, and the second-greatest of “God’s gifts”. Kekana made the comment during a speech at the IBM Think Johannesburg 2018 conference held at the Kayalami Conference Centre on 20 June 2018. “Technology is a gift from God. After the gift of Life it is perhaps the greatest of God’s gifts. It is the mother of civilizations, of arts and sciences,” said Kekana. Kekana added that the government will soon establish a Digital Industrial Revolution Commission, which will include the private sector and civil society. She called on those in attendance at the conference to “raise their hands” and state they want to help use technology to solve an array of issues. These include: “I would like to assure you that I will be the messenger in chief, when it comes to seeing technology as an enabler instead of a threat, because I have agreed to be sent,” she said.
