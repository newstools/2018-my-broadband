Rain CEO Willem Roos said they are confident their backlog of SIM deliveries will be resolved by the end of the week. Rain launched its first mobile products on 6 June 2018, offering data priced at 5c per MB and unlimited data usage for between 15 and 90 days after joining as part of a launch promotion. Many people ordered Rain SIMs and device bundles to test the service, and this overwhelmed the companyâ€™s systems. Customers have complained they did not receive their Rain SIMs as promised, and new subscribers are still waiting for their packages over a week after ordering. Roos said the delays were caused by higher-than-expected order volumes, along with technical issues. The company has now removed promised delivery times from its ordering process, and is working on resolving the backlog from its initial orders. Certain subscribers have also reported problems with their SIM activation, and not receiving the devices which they ordered with their Rain SIMs. This should soon be a thing of the past, said Roos. He added that a steady stream of new orders continues to flow in, which they are happy with.
