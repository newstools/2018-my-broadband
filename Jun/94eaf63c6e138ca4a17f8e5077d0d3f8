The Car Connectivity Consortium (CCC) has published its Digital Key 1.0 specification, which will enable drivers to unlock their vehicles with their smartphones. This specification aims to allow drivers to download a digital key on their smart devices and use it to unlock compatible vehicles. Carmakers who are part of the consortium include BMW, Hyundai, and Volkswagen Group, and smartphone manufacturers LG, Apple, and Samsung also form part of the organisation. The Digital Key 1.0 release is focussed on the security of a smartphone-based virtual key system and uses close-range NFC technology to interface with a compatible vehicle, removing the possibility of remote hacking. In addition to unlocking vehicles, this digital key would also allow car owners to start the engine of the vehicle and share access to their car from their smartphone. The CCC has also begun work on a second release of the specification, which will offer a standardised authentication protocol between vehicles and smart devices while ensuring compatibility between different products. The Digital Key 2.0 specification is expected to be completed inÂ early 2019.
