Google has started rolling outÂ personalised recommendations and related features in its Maps app. The company previewed new features for Google Maps at its developer conference last month, and these are now becoming available for users worldwide. One of the biggest changes to Maps is the overhauled Explore tab, which allows users to learn more about events and popular restaurants, bars, and other venues around their location. The app now also includes a For You tab, which provides personalised recommendations for restaurants, venues, and more. However, the For You tab and its features are currently only available in the United States, UK, Australia, and Japan. Users will also be able to tell Google Maps which type of cuisine they like, along with various other preferences, and will be presented with recommendations based on how likely they are to enjoy specific locations. The new features can be accessed by updating the Google Maps app.
