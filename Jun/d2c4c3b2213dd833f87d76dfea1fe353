Roku has announced that its estimates show 99.5% of all streaming hours from its devices come from channels with no links to pirate organisations, TorrentFreak reported. Roku began its crackdown on “pirate” channels on its platform after Mexico banned the sale of its devices last year. The company has over one million subscribers in Mexico, according to the report. A Mexican market research firm released figures which showed that 40% of all Roku owners in the country used the device to access content from illegitimate sources. A year later, Roku said it has turned this figure around and approximately 92% of streaming hours in Mexico came from legitimate channels. It said it is confident this number will align with the global average of 99.5%. Roku achieved the turnaround through a combination of enforcement efforts, including tracking down more than 400 pirate organisations and removing all channels associated with them. It also took action against thousands of social media pages that promoted Roku channels which allegedly infringed copyright. The process has not been without problems, with subscribers receiving an FBI takedown warning when trying to access channels such as YouTube and Netflix. Despite the teething problems, Roku’s efforts to clamp down on piracy will continue. Developers must now get certified before they can publish any channels, it stated.
