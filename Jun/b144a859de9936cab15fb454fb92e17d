Uber has won an 15-month probationary licence to operate in London. This follows its appeal to UK courts after Transport for London (TfL) refused to renew the ride-hailing app’s licence in September, the Guardian reported. The company acknowledged to the Westminster magistrates court that TfL was justified in its decision to reject Uber’s application for a five-year licence last year. TfL took issue with Uber’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences, and the insufficient background checks it conducts on drivers. Uber said it has made wholesale reforms in the past nine months, however. These include 24/7 telephone support, and proactively reporting serious incidents to the city’s police. Rather than a five-year permit, Uber said it would accept a licence for a 15-month probationary period, along with restrictions it has agreed to with TfL.
