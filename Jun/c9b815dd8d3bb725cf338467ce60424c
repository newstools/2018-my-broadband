Users are no longer able to book Uber rides from in the Google Maps app, Android Police reported. Previously, Android users with Google Maps installed and an active Uber account could see price estimates for Uber rides and book trips directly through the Maps interface. This means that users who previously used Google Maps to book Uber rides will now need to use the standalone Uber app for Android to continue using the platform. The feature was only available for Android devices and never launched on iOS, and there is no official reason for the removal of the ability to book Uber rides in Maps.
