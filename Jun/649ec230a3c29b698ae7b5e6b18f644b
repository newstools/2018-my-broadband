Sentech business development executive Aldred Dreyer will head up the digital TV migration project for South Africa. Speaking at a press conference in Pretoria, Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane said Dreyer would lead the project management office and digital TV migration programme. “We are pleased to announce that Mr Aldred Dreyer has been appointed to lead our PMO and the entire DTT project in the country,” said Mokonyane. “Mr Dreyer’s knowledge in the project is unparalleled as he recently led a similar project in neighbouring Namibia with great success.” Mokonyane added that the department would announce a new advisory council focused on increasing the uptake of digital terrestrial television (DTT). “The council shall include representatives of both government and industry to ensure that the project is driven in a joint manner in the spirit of inclusivity.” The migration from analogue to digital terrestrial television in South Africa is years behind schedule, following multiple missed deadlines by the government. The programme is also vital for freeing up valuable spectrum for local mobile networks.
