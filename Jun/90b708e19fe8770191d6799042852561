Niantic has announced a selection of new social features coming to Pokémon Go, including trading with other players. Pokémon Go will also allow players to add in-game friends via a unique Trainer Code which is generated for each player. Users will then be able to receive special gift items at PokéStops and Gyms, which they can give to their friends. Players will also be able to improve Friendship Levels with other trainers by trading creatures, battling in a raid, and more. Niantic said it would roll out these features in the coming week to Pokémon Go players worldwide.
