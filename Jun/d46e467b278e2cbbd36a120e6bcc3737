MyBroadband’s May 2018 Internet service provider (ISP) rankings reveal that Cool Ideas is the top-rated service provider in South Africa, followed by Cybersmart and CipherWave. The rankings are based on data collected from thousands of tests on MyBroadband’s speed test platform. MyBroadband’s HTML5 speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure a neutral testing environment. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to the MyBroadband Speed Test platform. MyBroadband also recently launched a feature which allows users to rate their ISP when they conduct a speed test. In May, 317,000 speed tests were performed on the MyBroadband speed test platform – with thousands of users rating the performance of their ISP. The table below provides an overview of the performance of South African ISPs. It should be noted that the average speed can include a variety of technologies, including wireless, ADSL, VDSL, and fibre.
