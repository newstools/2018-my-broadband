Foxconn has announced it will establish its North American headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Reuters reported. The company has purchased a seven-storey building in the city’s downtown area, which it said will support more than 500 employees. Foxconn previously announced that it would build a display manufacturing facility in Wisconsin, which would support over 13,000 employees. The company currently employees more than one million people worldwide and is the largest contract electronics manufacturer in the world. Foxconn’s plan to set up a US-based office and manufacturing facility comes after pressure from the Trump administration to invest in the country.
