Tesla will introduce new connectivity packages for its electric vehicles, Elecktrek reported. All Tesla’s vehicles launched since its Model S included Internet connectivity at no cost to the owner, with Tesla previously stating the connection would be available for four years. The company has now clarified its position on vehicle connectivity in an email sent to its sales team. All current vehicle owners and those who order a Model S, Model X, or Model 3 before the end of June 2018 will never pay to maintain their electric car’s Internet connection. After 1 July 2018, Tesla will start offering Premium Connectivity and Standard Connectivity packages to customers. Standard Connectivity packages will be available at no extra charge and include Internet connectivity for applications with low data usage – such as navigation. Most software updates will then need to be delivered via Wi-Fi, with the exception of safety updates. The Premium Connectivity package will reportedly be priced at $100 per year, and will include improved navigation data, in-car media streaming, and software updates over LTE. Model S and Model X vehicles ordered after 1 July 2018 will receive the Premium package free for a year.
