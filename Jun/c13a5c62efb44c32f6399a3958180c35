Photos of a device which is reported to be the upcoming Google Pixel 3 XL have leaked on the XDA Developers forums, Android Police reported. Based on the leak, it appears the Pixel 3 XL will have a new sensor to the right of the rear camera module, causing the flash to be pushed out slightly to accommodate it. Its bootloader indicates the device could sport 4GB RAM and 128GB of internal storage. The device also appears to have two front-facing cameras, hinting at a possible facial recognition unlocking mechanism – similar to Face ID on the iPhone X. The device also features a notch at the top of its display. Inspired by the leaks, phone mockup artist PhoneDesigner posted renders of the Pixel 3 XL on Twitter.
