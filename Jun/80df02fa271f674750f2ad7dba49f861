Data breach service Have I Been Pwned has been built into Firefox and 1Password, Troy Hunt announced in a blog post. Hunt – Have I Been Pwned’s creator – was instrumental in reporting the Master Deeds data leak in South Africa in 2017. Have I Been Pwned’s verified email subscriber base has grown to over 2 million people, but is only a drop in the ocean, said Hunt. “Of the 5.1 billion records that are in HIBP today, there’s 3.1 billion unique email addresses. I’m reaching 0.06% of them via the notification service and not a whole lot more in terms of people coming to the site,” said Hunt. “Don’t get me wrong – I’m enormously happy… but clearly, I’m barely scratching the surface. However, that scope is about to expand dramatically via two new partnerships.” Mozilla integrated Have I Been Pwned’s data into its Breach Alerts feature in 2017, and is now expanding this into a breach search and notification service called Firefox Monitor. 1Password has also added data from Have I Been Pwned to Watchtower, a feature in its web version of the product. “This helps Watchtower become mission control for accounts and introduces the Breach Report feature,” said Hunt.
