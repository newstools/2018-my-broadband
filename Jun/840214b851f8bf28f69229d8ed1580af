ASUS has revealed its first Android smartphone focused on gaming, the ROG Phone. The device was announced at Computex 2018 and sports an impressive 90Hz AMOLED display, along with an overclocked Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset. The ASUS ROG Phone is also compatible with a ton of accessories, from attachable cooling fans for increased performance to the TwinView Dock, which sports a second screen and a power bank – turning the device into an Android “Nintendo DS” lookalike. The smartphone has a large configurable RGB lighting zone on the back – as any gamer would expect – in the shape of the ASUS ROG logo. ASUS said the device is set to launch in 128GB and 512GB models later this year, although no pricing information is currently available.
