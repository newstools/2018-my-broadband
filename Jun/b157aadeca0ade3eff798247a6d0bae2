Snap plans to launch a gaming hub in its Snapchat platform, The Information reported. According to the report, Snap is already signing on game publishers and is set to launch the new platform later this year. The platform will allow third-party developers to build games which can be played in the Snapchat app, encouraging users to spend more time in the app. This could lead to increased advertising views and the potential to attract new users. The company has reportedly been working on an in-app gaming platform for a year and recently acquired a UK gaming software startup named PlayCanvas. Snapchat is not the first social media app to expand into gaming, with Tencentâ€™s WeChat app including features which push users towards its mobile games.
