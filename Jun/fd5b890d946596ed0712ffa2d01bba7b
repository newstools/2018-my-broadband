Facebook has launched a “Lite” app for Instagram in the Google Play Store, which is significantly smaller than the full app, TechCrunch reported. At 573kb, the app lets you post photos to your feed or Stories, watch Stories, browse the Explore page, and filter the feed. It does not let you post videos or send direct messages to friends. Instagram said it was testing Instagram Lite in Mexico this week, and the app not only takes up less space, but uses less data and starts faster. Instagram Lite will launch in more countries later this year, and receive messaging and video features, added the report. The app joins several other services sporting “Lite” versions of their main app, including Twitter, Uber, and Facebook.
