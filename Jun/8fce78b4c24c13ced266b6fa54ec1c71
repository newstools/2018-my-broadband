Rain has launched its first mobile products, which it said will redefine how South Africans use mobile data. The operator only supplies data offerings, reducing the price for consumers to connect to the Internet, it added. Rain offers consumers one plan: mobile data priced at 5c per MB (R50 per GB). “Customers will only pay for data they have used at the end of a month. There are no contracts lock-ins, no bundles, and no regular monthly fees,” said Rain. Data will never expire, and customers will never have to pay out-of-bundle rates. At any time, a Rain customer will be able to set and manage their SIM’s spend-limit, ensuring that they never experience bill-shock, it added. Rain’s mobile products are an elegant way of steering clear of any regulatory hurdles related to out-of-bundle prices and expiring data. ICASA’s recently amended End-User and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations aim to protect consumers against out-of-bundle bill shock. This is achieved through prohibiting the charging of higher out-of-bundle rates without the consumer giving consent to the charges. The regulations also require network operators to offer customers the option to roll over unused data. Rain is bypassing these regulations by not offering any data bundles, with its data paid for as it is consumed. Users only pay for the data which they use, which means there can be no out-of-bundle or unused data. To promote its new mobile products, Rain has launched a promotion which allows subscribers to experience unlimited data usage for 15 days after joining. “These free unlimited data days will be a risk-free way for consumers to experience the network and test their individual coverage needs,” said Rain. Consumers will also have the option to add unlimited off-peak data for R250 per month to their Rain plan. This will award them unlimited data usage for 19 hours a day, except at peak times – between 18:00 and 23:00. During peak hours, consumers will pay the standard 5c per MB.
