Uber has submitted a patent application to the United States Patent and Trademark Office in which it details an AI that can identify drunk and tired passengers. The patent is called “Predicting User State Using Machine Learning,” and suggests the system could be used to accommodate fares who are not behaving the way they normally would. It would measure user activity such as text input characteristics, interface interaction characteristics, and device handling characteristics to classify whether someone is drunk or tired. Text input characteristics may include the number of typographical errors entered by a user, or the number of characters erased by a user while entering a search query. Examples of interface interaction characteristics include the amount of time for a user to interact with the user interface after new information is shown to the user, or the user’s accuracy in pressing an interface element on the device. According to Uber, knowing whether a rider is drunk or tired could help prevent issues with a trip.
