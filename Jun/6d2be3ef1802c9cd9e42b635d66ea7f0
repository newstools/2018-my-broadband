The Firefox 61 browser will be available to download from today, for Windows, Linux, and Mac. According to Softpedia News, Firefox 61 offers improved performance and stability, and faster tab switching on Windows and Linux. Better page rendering times have also been promised, and Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 is enabled by default. For fans of “dark mode” visuals, the dark theme has also been made more consistent across the browser. “Another interesting change implemented in Firefox 61 is the blocking of access to FTP subresources in HTTP and HTTPS sites to improve user security,” stated the Softpedia News report.
