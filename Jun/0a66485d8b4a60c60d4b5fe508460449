Backup solutions provider Backblaze has released its hard drive reliability statistics for Q1 2018. Backblaze compared hard drives used in its operations – from Seagate, Western Digital, Toshiba, and HGST – for the report. Reliability was measured as an annualised failure rate, calculated using the number of drive failures relative to the number of drives. Backblaze then recorded the failure rates of its hard drives from 1 January to 31 March 2018, along with the real annual failure rate for each drive. The company had over 100,000 mechanical drives as of 31 March 2018, and was monitoring 98,188 drives which were used to store data. Drives used for testing purposes and models without at least 45 drives were removed from the data set, leaving Backblaze with 98,046 hard drives. The results of its report are detailed below.
