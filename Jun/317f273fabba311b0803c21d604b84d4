Microsoft has dropped support for several older processors in Windows 7 after reportedly giving up on resolving a problem listed as a “known issue,” ZDNet reported. According to the report, the March 2018 security update for Windows 7 listed a known issue where a “Stop” error will occur on PCs that don’t support Streaming Single Instructions Multiple Data Extensions 2 (SSE2). The report notes that SSE2 was introduced in August 2000. Initially, Microsoft indicated in the “workaround” column of the known issue that it was working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release. However, in the June security update, the text has been changed to read as follows: “Upgrade your machines with a processor that supports SSE2 or virtualize those machines.”
