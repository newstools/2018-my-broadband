Microsoft’s Azure ExpressRoute service is now live in Teraco’s Johannesburg and Cape Town data centres. Teraco told MyBroadband that customers can now connect directly to Azure ExporessRoute via the Teraco Cloud Exchange in both cities. “Teraco’s Cloud Exchange is an infrastructure platform, located in Teraco’s colocation facilities, allowing clients to build and manage private, SLA-governed connections to multiple clouds over a single physical connection,” said the company. “The ExpressRoute is now live in Teraco Johannesburg and Cape Town, and clients can connect via a physical cable or through the Teraco Cloud Exchange, which is Southern Africa’s only truly neutral switching platform between clients and multiple cloud on-ramps.” With the addition of Azure ExpressRoute, clients will be able to take advantage of high-performance, secure SLA-based connections to Microsoft Azure cloud servers. “Reliable and predictable network performance are essential ingredients for the successful implementation of a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy, as applications are expected to seamlessly operate between private and multiple public cloud environments,” said Teraco. Azure ExpressRoute offers private connections between Azure data centres and on-premise infrastructure, offering lower latencies and more reliability than typical Internet connections, it added.
