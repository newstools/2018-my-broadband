Twitter has made several changes to how users follow discussions about their interests and breaking news, it announced in a blog post. The company said it is experimenting with topic tabs in Explore, following requests that it should be easier to navigate if topics were organised better. These topic tabs will make it easier to see what’s happening in news and entertainment segments, and what’s most relevant to a user. The feature will be available in the coming months to iOS and Android users in the US. A change that will be implemented immediately and be more widely available, however, is an update to search. The update will show related news, events, or stories at the top of search results. Users will be able to tap to get a recap and see the latest discussion and videos are. Twitter is also expanding “Happening now” at the top of timelines to include Tweets about breaking and personalised news. Previously, it was limited to sports when your selected team was playing.
