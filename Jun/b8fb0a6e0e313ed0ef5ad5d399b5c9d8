Apple will reportedly launch three new iPhones this year, with one of the devices set to be available at cheaper prices than two new flagship models. The devices are set to be two models with OLED displays, and one model with an LCD display. According to a report from MarketWatch, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty has stated that the “cheaper” iPhone – which will feature the LCD screen – will sell for between $699 and $769. Huberty stated that a new 6.5-inch OLED model will sell for $999, while a new 5.8-inch OLED model will start at $899. The report stated that these prices are for the base models, with the minimum amount of on-board storage. Models with more on-board storage will be priced higher, as is the case with Apple’s current range of iPhones.
