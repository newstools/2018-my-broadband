Online ticket platform Ticketfly is back online following a major attack which compromised user details. The platform said that no credit or debit card details were accessed, but the names, addresses, email addresses, and cellphone numbers of 27 million accounts were exposed. Passwords for Ticketfly users were not accessed, but the website reset the passwords of all users to ensure security. “We take privacy and security very seriously and upon first learning about this incident we took swift action to secure the data of our clients and fans,” said Ticketfly. “Ticketfly.com, Ticketfly Backstage, and the vast majority of venue/promoter websites are back online.” The company added that its top priorities are ensuring user security, getting services back up and running, and regaining user trust.
