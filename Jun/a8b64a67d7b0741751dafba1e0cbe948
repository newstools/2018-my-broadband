Following an order from the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASA) that Vodacom withdraw its “best network for 3 years in a row” claim, the operator has published a new full-page advertisement in Sunday newspapers. Vodacom’s new advert, posted below, now states it has “SA’s Best Network” – removing the reference to “3 years”. The ASA recently ruled that Vodacom’s claim it was South Africa’s best network for three years in a row was misleading and must be retracted. The instruction followed a back-and-forth battle between Vodacom and MTN over the right to call themselves “best network” in South Africa. Vodacom relied on customer satisfaction survey results from the South African Customer Satisfaction Index (SAcsi) for its previous claim. It previously relied on performance results from speed tests by Ookla, MyBroadband, ATIO, and others, but switched to the consumer survey results after MTN started dominating the rankings. Network quality tests by MyBroadband and P3 Communications show MTN has the best network in SA, and when the ASA ruled against Vodacom’s use of its “best network for 3 years” advert, MTN was quick to publish its own advert stating its network was the best in the country. The ad stated “There’s no debating SA’s Best Network*”, with the asterisk pointing to its recent network test wins. After a week of relative silence from both camps on the matter, Vodacom has fired a fresh shot at MTN with its new advert. The new advert still relies on the SAcsi survey, but now states Vodacom has the best network in SA, with no reference to a time frame. The SAcsi survey results are based on consumer interviews and the perception of users, whereas MTN’s claims are based on real-world data from network performance tests.
