Google has launched a new podcast app named Google Podcasts for Android. The app uses Google’s recommendation algorithms to suggest podcasts based on listening history and preferences. After downloading the Podcasts app, users can subscribe and listen to any podcast for free – and they are also able to adjust playback speed or skip over prolonged silences. Google Podcasts syncs across multiple devices, meaning you can also pick up where your podcast left off on another device when listening online. The app features Google Assistant integration, allowing users to search for podcasts directly from their Assistant interface. “Looking forward, Google Podcasts will be a launchpad for building an even better podcast listening experience using AI,” said Google. “For example, as speech-to-text technology continues to improve, we’ll be able to provide new features like automatic subtitling.” Google Podcasts is available to download from the Google Play Store.
