Samsung South Africa is running an excellent discount special on its new Samsung QLED TVs, giving potential buyers thousands of rand off. TV buyers can take advantage of the discounts until 15 July 2018, which range from R5,000 to R10,000 off the purchase price. To qualify for the discounts, you must either have recently purchased, or purchase, a Samsung Galaxy S9 or Galaxy S9+ smartphone. Customers can call a dedicated hotline on 0860 726 7864 to determine whether they qualify, or visit the discount page on Samsung’s website. Samsung’s QLED TVs deliver 100% colour volume and great picture quality while retaining a long lifespan and reducing the potential for burn-in. The TVs also consolidate all connected device functionality into a single remote, making it easier to manage your smart home or just control separate devices such as audio players. Thanks to technologies such as Ultra Black, Q Contrast, and Peak Illuminator, Samsung QLED displays can offer bright, vivid colours in addition to precision black pixels. This results in a very high contrast ratio, which is how the QLED panel manages to deliver high-quality HDR images and mantain its high motion rate. Inviting friends over to watch the game no longer needs to be a struggle for the best seat either, as Samsung’s Q Viewing Angle technology lets users enjoy the same viewing experience from any angle, making every seat a great seat. From die-hard sports fans who want the best home viewing experience possible, to Netflix lovers enjoying a new series, watching content on a Samsung QLED TV delivers the best picture a user can ask for. The QLED discounts are detailed in the image below. To learn more about Samsung’s QLED TVs, visit the Samsung website.  This article was published in partnership with Samsung.
