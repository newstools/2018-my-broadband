It’s time to land the catch of your dreams with Vodacom Red. During Vodacom Super Rugby 2018, lucky Vodacom Red clients have enjoyed a number of money-can’t-buy experiences as part of Vodacom Red Rewards. From the Vodacom Red Wild Dogs Experience in the Kruger National Park to the Vodacom Red Golf Tour hosted at two of SA’s most prestigious golf courses, Red clients have been spoiled with experiences they will never forget. The next experience lined up for Red clients is the Vodacom Red Tiger Fishing Experience. Vodacom Red clients have the chance to enjoy a 5-star outdoor experience on the mighty Zambezi and hunt one of Africa’s most iconic fish – the Tiger. This is the ultimate adrenalin-fuelled fishing experience, with Vodacom Red providing the best gear, boats and private guides to take you right to the action. Vodacom clients will share this experience with top South African Vodacom Super Rugby players as they go from try lines to tight lines as they tackle the Tiger together. This is one of the few times it would not be a good thing for these players to break the line. To keep Red guests entertained, Radio Raps’ own Jonathan and Mack Rapapali from Jacaranda FM fame will also be joining the Vodacom Red Tiger Fishing Experience and trying their hand at landing a prize-sized tiger. Luxury transfers, VIP accommodation, fine cuisine, helicopter flips, river cruises and world-class entertainment will have everyone talking about more than just the catch of the day. Hook, line and sinker – Vodacom Red will make sure this bucket-list experience doesn’t get away.
