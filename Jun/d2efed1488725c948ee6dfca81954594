AMD has revealed its second-generation Ryzen Threadripper processors at Computex 2018 in Taiwan. The new processors will feature chips with up to 32 physical cores and 64 threads, and are based on the company’s 12nm architecture. AMD’s Ryzen Threadripper chips are aimed at high-end desktop builds, and will reportedly deliver improved performance across rendering, post-production, and encoding workloads. The second generation of Threadripper CPUs is set to launch in the third quarter of 2018. The manufacturer also announced the next generation of its EPYC server processors, which are called “Rome” and are built on a Zen 2 architecture with a 7nm manufacturing process. These chips will be available in 2019. AMD also showcased its upcoming Radeon Vega graphics cards, which will be based on a 7nm manufacturing process, which AMD said is optimised for professional applications. The 7nm Vega GPUs will be available in both server and workstation form factors in the second half of 2018. Not to be left behind, Intel showed off its own upcoming high-core-count processor at Computex 2018, which will compete with AMD in the high-end desktop market. Intel displayed a 28-core CPU running at 5GHz, which achieved a Cinebench score of 7,334 during a live benchmark test. Intel said the chip would be available to consumers by the end of the year, according to a report from AnandTech.
