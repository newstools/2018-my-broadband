SEACOM recently upgraded its submarine network system between the southern and eastern Africa landing points and Europe. The upgrade adds 500Gbps of capacity to the network, and follows a previous 500Gbps upgrade 18 months ago. The capacity of the cable system is now 1.5Tbps. SEACOM said the capacity upgrade will improve the development of Africa’s Internet and enable better access for African service providers and businesses. The upgrade increases available capacity in SEACOM’s key markets, which include Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, and South Africa, and allows the company to deliver high-capacity connectivity quickly while providing for future demands. SEACOM said the latest deployment is based on 100Gbps Coherent DWDM technology, which provides room for the company to quickly add more capacity as required. “This latest upgrade enables SEACOM to meet those demands, and to provide our customers with scalable solutions for the future,” said SEACOM CTO Claes Segelberg.
