If forced to choose between Netflix and DStv, tech-savvy South Africans would opt for the US streaming service. This is according to the results of MyBroadband’s 2018 DStv and Netflix Survey. The survey was taken by 9,857 MyBroadband readers and forum members – an excellent representation of South Africans with knowledge of the TV and streaming space. Survey respondents were asked if they could only choose one entertainment service, what would they pick. 72% of all respondents said Netflix, while DStv came in second place at 14%. Showmax was in third with 5%, while Amazon Prime Video came in fourth with 2%. When the results were separated to only look at responses from DStv account holders, however, the figures changed. Respondents with a DStv subscription were more likely to select DStv as their first service choice. Among DStv users, 62% said they would opt for Netflix as their only service, while 22% said they would pick DStv. The inverse was true for respondents who did not have a DStv subscription. Among respondents without a DStv subscription, 82% selected Netflix as their first choice, while 4% selected DStv. The results of the survey are detailed in the graphic below.
