Rain launched its first mobile products this month with one tariff – mobile data priced at 5c per MB (R50 per GB). This product steers clear of regulatory hurdles related to out-of-bundle prices and expiring data. While many reports following the launch focused on Rain’s R50-per-GB mobile data offering, the real value lies in its uncapped off-peak data add-on for R250 per month. The add-on provides users with unlimited data usage for 19 hours a day, except at peak times – between 18:00 and 23:00. Most users are at home during these times, which means they will be on their home Wi-Fi network and will not rely on mobile data for connectivity. Rain does not put any tethering restrictions on this uncapped offering and has not stated a strict fair-use policy, which bodes well for high-end users. The uncapped add-on is therefore unmatched in the South African market currently. A concern for users, however, is coverage, as Rain focuses on metropolitan areas. Connectivity in shopping malls and office blocks has also proved to be troublesome. Rain CEO Willem Roos told MyBroadband they are working to improve their coverage in shopping malls, and that certain projects are already in progress in this regard. However, he warned it will take time to ensure good indoor coverage in malls and other prominent buildings. Users will not want to be stuck without connectivity – either when travelling or in metropolitan areas where Rain does not have coverage – and fortunately dual-SIM phones are available to solve this problem. Using a dual-SIM phone, like the Huawei P20 Lite sold by Rain, with an MTN or Vodacom SIM as a fallback data and voice service is a simple solution. You will enjoy unlimited data for 19 hours a day when you have Rain coverage and can then fall back on MTN or Vodacom’s excellent networks when Rain does not have coverage. Rain offers high-end mobile users in South Africa the first affordable uncapped LTE-A data product and this is what should grab users’ attention.
