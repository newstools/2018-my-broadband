Microsoft is building self-checkout technology that could compete with systems from Amazon and its Amazon Go stores – reported Reuters. Amazon launched its first “Just Walk Out” store in 2017 in Seattle, near Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond. According to Amazon, the store uses the same types of technologies found in self-driving cars, including computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning. Users scan their smartphone at a turnstile to enter the store, after which cameras and sensors identify what they take from the shelves. When done shopping, users simply walk out and Amazon automatically bills their credit card. Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters reported that Microsoft aims to empower retailers to keep pace with Amazon. Microsoft has demonstrated the technology to retailers and is in talks with Walmart about a potential partnership, it added.
