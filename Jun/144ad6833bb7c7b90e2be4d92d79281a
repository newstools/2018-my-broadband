Please Call Me “inventor” Kenneth Makate has accused KPMG of participating in a blatant coverup by withholding a forensic report, Business Insider reported. Makate previously lodged a request with KPMG for certain information contained in a 2008 KPMG forensic report, which he said would assist negotiations between himself and Vodacom. KPMG denied this request, stating it had an obligation to protect commercial information and the privacy of third parties. Makate appealed to the CEO and chairperson of KPMG, stating the report uncovered breaches of governance at Vodacom and questioned the firm’s reasoning for withholding the document. KPMG told Makate he would have to return to court and apply for access to the document, as it did not have the client’s consent to release the report. Makate believes the KPMG report will assist him in getting payment from Vodacom for his work on the network’s Please Call Me service. In 2016, the Constitutional Court ruled in favour of Makate in a long-running legal battle which centred around his lack of compensation from Vodacom following the success of the Please Call Me. The court ruled that Vodacom was bound by an agreement it had with Makate regarding the Please Call Me, and ordered him to be compensated. Vodacom reportedly made a settlement offer of R10 million to Makate earlier this year, which he dismissed as a “pittance”.
