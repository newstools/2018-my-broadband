SpaceX has stated it will not launch two tourists on a lunar mission this year, The Wall Street Journal reported. In February 2017, the private space company announcedÂ it planned to ferry a pair of tourists around the moon in 2018, but these plans have been postponed. The company was approached to fly two private citizens around the moon, and the passengers have already paid a significant deposit for the mission. The earliest launch date for the flight is now expected to be in the middle of 2019, although it could be postponed further. SpaceX previously said it plans to use its Dragon 2 spacecraft and Falcon Heavy rocket for the mission.
