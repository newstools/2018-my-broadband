Spotify is offering advances to managers and independent artists in exchange for licensing their music directly to the streaming service, Billboard reported. The platform has reportedly offered large payments to management firms if they agree to license tracks by indie artists to Spotify. In certain cases, managers and artists will also earn 50% of the streaming revenue for those tracks. According to the report, the licensing deals would allow Spotify to pay a slightly lower revenue share to the artists than they would to a record label, while the artists would receive more revenue from streams. Artists who choose to license their music directly to Spotify will still be free to license work to other independed platforms and earn full revenue from these deals.
