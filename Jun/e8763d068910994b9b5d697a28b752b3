Rainâ€™s mobile network appears to be suffering from connectivity problems. Two smartphones used by MyBroadband which are running Rain SIMs lost all network signal after 12:00. When the network signal returned, no data throughput was available on the network. Multiple users on the MyBroadband Forum have also reported a loss of connectivity and data throughput. The reported downtime comes after Rain recently offered its mobile users unlimited data usage for June. Rain was contacted for feedback on the matter, but was not immediately available for comment.
