Telegram founder Pavel Durov said in a recent post that Apple has blocked the messaging services from releasing updates for its iOS apps. The block came after Russian authorities ordered Apple to remove Telegram from the App Store. Russia banned the app when Telegram refused to comply with a court order to allow authorities to decrypt private messages between users. The crackdown on Telegram resulted in the blocking of IP addresses from cloud services providers, including Google and Amazon, in Russia. Amazon and Google then disabled domain fronting, the feature Telegram was using to make it difficult for censors to block its services. At the time, Durov said Apple didn’t side with Telegram. “While Russia makes up only 7% of Telegram’s user base, Apple is restricting updates for all Telegram users around the world,” he said. “As a result, we’ve also been unable to fully comply with GDPR for our EU users by the deadline of 25 May 2018. We are continuing our efforts to resolve the situation.”
