Vodacom has partnered with Google to launch its first Android Go smartphones in South Africa. The company launched its new Vodacom Vaya programme at an event in Sandton, Johannesburg. Android 8.1 Go Edition is a streamlined version of the Android 8.1 operating system, which retains the interface and core features of Android 8.1 while offering a smaller install size and less performance overhead. The OS aims to offer a similar experience to the full version of Android on devices without high-end specifications. Google Director of Android Platform Partnerships for Google in Africa Mahir Sahin said Android devices have to work well at all price points, which is why the company created Android 8.1 Go. “We have made the OS as compact as possible and optimised the pre-installed apps that come with the device,” said Sahin. Vodacom launched its new devices as part of its Vodacom Vaya proposition, which includes data specials created for Android Go smartphones. The devices are priced below R1,000 and are part of the company’s plan to migrate customers to 3G and 4G handsets. Vodacom said that of the 30 million sub-R1,000 smartphones sold in South Africa, only half a million are 4G-enabled. The new smartphones which support Android 8.1 Go are below.   Vodacom also launched tailored promotions for its Android Go devices, which offer monthly data bundles and data for the lightweight YouTube Go application.
