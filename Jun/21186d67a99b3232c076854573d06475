The South Gauteng High Court has ruled against MTN’s application to revoke Transnet’s decision to award a tender to Vodacom for the provision of communication services. In March 2018, MTN stated it had applied for the tender decision to be reviewed and set aside, stating that it was irregular and unlawful. Transnet had previously disqualified MTN from the tender process, after which the operator applied for an interdict prohibiting the awarding of the tender to Vodacom. The High Court has now found that the awarding of the tender to Vodacom was free from any irregularities and that the contract concluded between Transnet and Vodacom was valid and lawful, a Vodacom spokesperson told MyBroadband. The matter also followed ICASA issuing a notification of a public hearing for a complaint brought against MTN by Transnet. It was alleged that MTN was in breach of ICASA’s number portability regulations, after MTN refused to port Transnet’s numbers to Vodacom.
