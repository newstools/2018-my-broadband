Facebook has launched a dedicated game streaming platform in its website named Fb.gg. The new platform is a landing page for all Facebook Live streamers who produce video game content and will present certain streams depending on who a user follows, along with general featured streams. This follows the launch of Facebookâ€™s gaming creator pilot programme earlier this year, which was designed to attract more video game streamers to the website. Popular games on the Fb.gg landing page at the moment include Fortnite, PUBG, and Mobile Legends. The new gaming hub is attracting a large audience, with almost 3,000 people streaming Fortnite for an audience of over 200,000.
