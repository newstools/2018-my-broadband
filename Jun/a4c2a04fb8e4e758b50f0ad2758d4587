Razer has announced that its Chroma lighting ecosystem will soon be compatible with devices from selected third-party manufacturers. This will allow gamers with Razer peripherals to sync their RGB lighting across their cases, motherboards, fans, and other hardware. Razer’s Chroma Connected Devices Programme will allow a number of partners to sync with Chroma lighting via an API, translating to a single click on their respective lighting platforms. “Gamers today own multiple RGB lighting-enabled devices, but they can’t enjoy a truly immersive experience because these devices don’t talk to each other,” said Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan. “For the first time ever, we’re letting our partners tap into the Chroma ecosystem so we can bridge that gap for the benefit of all gamers.” Razer said the partners would include MSI, NZXT, AMD, Thermaltake, Liani, Vertagear, and Ducky. The first third-party products with Razer Chroma support will launch in the fourth quarter of 2018.
