Researchers at MIT have created a new artificial intelligence which it calls the “world’s first psychopath AI”. The AI is named “Norman” after the disturbed killer from Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho, and was trained using images posted on a subreddit dedicated to death and graphic images. MIT used deep learning algorithms to train the program to caption images. “Norman suffered from extended exposure to the darkest corners of Reddit, and represents a case study on the dangers of artificial intelligence gone wrong when biased data is used in machine learning algorithms,” said MIT. After training Norman to perform image captioning, the team then compared the AI’s responses to Rorschach inkblot tests to those of a standard artificial intelligence. The results of the comparison are below.
