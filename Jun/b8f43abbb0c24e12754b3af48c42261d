The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) stated that its trading opening was delayed this morning due to a technical glitch in its system. Before the market opened, the exchange noted that no open orders were appearing on all EQM instruments and advised clients to refrain from booking any reported trades on equity markets. The JSE restarted its equity market, a process which took around an hour, and further delayed the opening of trading. Just after 10:00, the JSE sated that the equity market would move into an opening auction at 10:40. “Continuous trading will commence at 11:00 and Off-Book trade reporting will be available from 10:40. The remaining trading sessions will follow according to the standard schedule for the day,” said the JSE.
