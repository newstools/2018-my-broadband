The Verge has reviewed various USB-C adapters, and crowned the Satechi Aluminum Multi-Port Adapter V2 the winner. Calling it the “best USB-C hub” for new laptops, the V2 adapter features: The adapter is made from aluminium, and features a single UBS-C cable that plugs into the host machine. The USB-C port can handle a max power of 49W, while the HDMI port will provide a monitor with up to 4K at 30Hz visuals. With many new laptops coming out with fewer USB-A ports and more USB-C ports, but many peripherals still on the older standard, hubs like this are necessities – particularly for new MacBook Pro owners. Satechi said the V2 adapter has a recommended retail price of $90.
