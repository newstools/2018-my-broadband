The Pirate Bay’s website is offline, with users seeing a “bad gateway” message from Cloudflare when accessing the page, TorrentFreak reported. According to The Pirate Bay’s site status page, while the website is offline for everyone, its Tor site remains online. No estimated time to repair the issue has been given, the report stated. The outage follows a problem with the torrent site’s upload functionality last week, which was broken for several days. Several VIP uploaders reported the problem, stating they received an “Error – Empty File” notice, regardless of what they tried to upload to the platform. Moderators of The Pirate Bay forums pointed people to The Pirate Bay status page, which showed that everyone on the platform was experiencing the same issue. While the upload issue appears to be resolved, The Pirate Bay’s website went offline soon after, stated the report.
