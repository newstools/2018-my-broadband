Staff at Superbalist and Spree have been briefed about a merger between the two online shopping platforms. Superbalist is an online fashion retailer which was founded in 2010 as CityMob, and rebranded in 2013 to become Superbalist. Superbalist was then acquired by Takealot in August 2015, with Superbalist continuing to operate as an independent division from its offices in Foreshore, Cape Town. Through Naspers’ shareholding in Takealot, it indirectly owns a stake in Superbalist. Spree is also an online fashion store which offers local and international fashion for women, men, and children. Spree – founded in 2013 – is owned by Media24’s ecommerce division, which is part of the Naspers group. It also operates out of its Foreshore, Cape Town offices. Takealot stated it was preparing a formal announcement on the matter, and would provide details on the move.
