Uber is going to court to overturn the Transport for London (TfL) decision to refuse the renewal of its licence in September, Reuters reported. TfL took issue with Uber’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences, and the insufficient background checks it conducts on drivers. Uber may continue to operate in London for the duration of the hearing. According to the report, Uber introduced a number of changes to its business model since losing its license in London, including 24/7 telephone support and proactively reporting serious incidents to the city’s police. It has also seen major changes in its senior management, and apologised for its past mistakes. Uber has stated it is willing to compromise to keep its licence, and has collected over 800,000 signatures on a Change.org petition to keep the service active in London.
