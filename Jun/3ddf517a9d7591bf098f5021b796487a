Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced it will add Ethereum Classic to its service in the coming months. The company said that once it has reached the final testing phase for integrating the cryptocurrency, it will announce a concrete launch date. Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a hard fork of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, which was created as a result of a disagreement within the Ethereum community. It centred around whether user funds stolen from a decentralised autonomous organisation should be rolled-back. While the Ethereum blockchain rolled back the mistake and attempted to rectify the damage done, Ethereum Classic proponents argued that to preserve the immutability of the blockchain, the stolen funds must be left alone. Coinbase said it would support Ethereum Classic “in all geographies where the asset is compliant with local law”. It also plans to add support for the ERC20 token standard in the future.
