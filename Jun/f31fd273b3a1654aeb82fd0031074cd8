Samsung has sent out invitations for a Galaxy device event on 9 August 2018, according to a report by The Verge. The invitation does not specify what will be launched at the event, but speculation is that Samsung will reveal the Galaxy Note 9. The report stated that the timing of the event – the Note 8 launched in August 2017 – and an image of a stylus with the invite points towards a new Note device. Recent reports have stated that the Galaxy Note 9 will receive upgraded cameras and may also come in a 512GB model. The August event comes a month before Apple’s expected September iPhone event, where three new iPhone models are expected to be unveiled.
