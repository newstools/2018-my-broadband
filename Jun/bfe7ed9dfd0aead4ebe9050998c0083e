PageUp, an online recruitment services organisation, has been hit by a data breach, which has affected its customer companies. The company stated earlier this month that it identified suspicious activity on its network, and immediately started an investigation into the matter. “PageUp believes that certain information pertaining to staff members, applicants, and referees was accessed by an unauthorised third party,” said the Australian company. It stated that job applicants’ contact details – including name, email address, physical address, and telephone number – may have been accessed. Employment details at the time of an application, including employment status, company, and title, may also be at risk. Companies which use PageUp’s HR software may also be affected by the incident. Following the statement from PageUp, Anglo American has sent a mail to stakeholders about the incident – as it uses PageUp’s online recruitment services platform. “The purpose of this note is to let you know that your data may have been affected by this incident,” stated the company in a letter seen by MyBroadband. “PageUp has advised us that personal data held within its platform, including data relating to Anglo American job applications, may have been affected by this incident.” “We are working with PageUp to find out more about the nature of the incident and details of individuals who are likely to have been affected.” Anglo American said that the information is limited to what is held in the PageUp recruitment platform, and in no way affects its systems. Online applications through the system have been temporarily suspended as a result.
