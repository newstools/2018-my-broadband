Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) has announced that there will no longer be passenger boarding calls at certain airports from 1 July 2018. “Port Elizabeth International Airport, Bram Fischer International Airport, East London Airport, George Airport, Upington International Airport, and Kimberley Airport will all be implementing the intervention to reduce noise levels at the airports,” said ACSA Corporate Affairs Manager Senior Manager Senzeni Ndebele. From 1 July 2018, public address microphones at domestic departures terminals and gates of ACSA’s six regional airports will be switched off. “Passengers are advised to check their boarding passes and the flight information display boards for boarding times,” he said. “The only instances where centralised terminal announcements will be made will be for irregular operations, such as gate changes, flight time changes, security matters, system failures, and customer service anomalies such as lost minors.” Ndebele said the move is an important step toward improving the customer service experience of passengers, and is in line with international best practice. “This follows the implementation of noise reduction measures taken at other airports within South Africa in the last year.” This includes major airports like Cape Town International stating it would stop boarding calls.
