PriceCheck CEO Kevin Tucker has been in the ecommerce game for many years, having founded the company in 2006. After growing the business and selling it to Naspers in 2010, Tucker bought PriceCheck back in 2015. Since then, the site has grown – and now serves 2.4 million unique viewers a month. Tucker told MyBroadband that they reach 17 million unique shoppers in total, which is “almost the entire shopping audience in South Africa”. “That places us in the top three ecommerce businesses in South Africa, excluding classifieds like OLX and Gumtree,” said Tucker. Tucker said PriceCheck’s current focus area is maintaining its high-quality lead generation, and increasing traffic to online retailers – large and small. “We’re focused on driving our quality traffic to online retailers. We are highly-recommended by our bigger clients, who regard us as their best-performing channel. I think there will also be opportunity for growth in the future, when the smaller retailers grow,” he said. Tucker also offered advice for local ecommerce companies looking to grow their market share and capture more of a consumer’s spend. “South African retailers need to replicate the retail experience that happens in-store, online. I think that’s the biggest challenge,” he said. “South Africans are very happy shopping in stores, and I think online retail stores have a long way to go to replicate that shopping experience.” This includes shoppers being able to talk to a sales person, get recommendations, and see sales racks, bundle discounts, and buy-one-get-one-free listings. “We really need to encourage consumers to shop for more of the same items at a time. Instead of buying one item, we need to encourage them to buy two or more, and we need to have the ability to up-scale warranties and insurance, and all the things that make traditional retail successful.”
