ASUS has unveiled itsÂ H370 Mining Master motherboard, which boasts support for up to 20 graphics cards. The GPUs are connected over USB riser cables to the board, with each card powered by a PCIe x1 link router over the USB 3.1 Gen-1 connection. This setup removes unnecessary connections and provides sturdier contact with the motherboard than standard PCIe risers, said ASUS. ASUS has also included a software suite with the motherboard which allows for easy monitoring of graphics card health. The motherboard boasts three 24-pin power connections, allowing it to be powered by up to three power supplies simultaneously. ASUS said the H370 Mining Master will be available later this year and will be displayed at Computex 2018.
