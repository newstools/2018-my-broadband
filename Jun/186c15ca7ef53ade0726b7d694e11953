The South African open source, Linux, and Postgres community will be treated to two conferences in October – LinuxConf on 8 October and PostgresConf on 9 October. LinuxConf is a one-day conference in Johannesburg aimed at the Linux and open source community. Topics covered at LinuxConf will include Linux Kernel and OS, Linux distributions, virtualisation, system administration, open source applications, networking, and development environments. PostgresConf is aimed at the database administration and developer community, where they will exchange ideas and learn about the features and upcoming trends within PostgreSQL. Both conferences take place at the Birchwood Hotel and Conference Centre, which is located close to OR Tambo airport. “The call for papers is open for both conferences and tickets are available for LinuxConf, with the ticket sales for PostgresConf opening soon,” said conference organiser Malcolm McLean.
