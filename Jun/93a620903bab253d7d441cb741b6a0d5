Google has overhauled its account management experience for Android devices, offering a simpler and more intuitive interface. The new Google Account hub supports easier access to privacy and security options along with detailed summaries of information such as payment methods, subscriptions, and contact. Google has also added search functionality which lets users easily find settings menus and other information by typing their query into a built-in search bar. Users can also access a dedicated support section which offers assistance with common tasks like upgrading account storage and improving privacy settings. The new Data and Personalisation tab allows users to choose which types of activity data are saved to their account and access the Privacy Checkup wizard. Googleâ€™s overhauled Account hub is now available on Android and will launch on web and iOS later this year.
