MWEB has admitted that its advertising which promotes free Wi-Fi access at hotspots around the country is incorrect and promised to remove reference to this service. This advertising appeared on MWEB’s fibre-to-the-home product page, which promoted the benefits of signing up for MWEB’s FTTH service. One consumer was less than happy after he was told by an MWEB customer care representative that the free Wi-Fi service was discontinued in September 2017. He lodged a complaint at the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASA), arguing that MWEB’s advertising was misleading. MWEB responded, saying that after the discontinuation of the Wi-Fi product, it reviewed and amended its marketing material to ensure reference to that product was removed. “As a result of human error, the material referred in the complaint was not identified and amended,” MWEB said. MWEB added that it has now deleted references to free Wi-Fi and took steps to ensure that the type of error does not occur again. The ASA accepted MWEB’s undertaking to amend its advertising and did not rule on the matter.
