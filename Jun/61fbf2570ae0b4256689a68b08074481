Google is rolling out its upgraded Messages platform to desktop web browsers, allowing users to send and receive texts from their PC. The feature will become available for users this week, and can be enabled by selecting “Messages for web” under the More options menu in the mobile app. Users can then visit messages.android.com and scan a QR code presented in their web browser to start texting from their PC. The mobile app is also getting support for inline GIF searches, Google’s Smart Reply recommendations, and link previews within conversations. Additionally, one-time passwords received in the Messages app can now be copied with a single tap.
