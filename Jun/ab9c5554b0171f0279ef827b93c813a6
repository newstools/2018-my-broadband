The next 30 days are packed with world-class football teams competing for the FIFA World Cup trophy, but with six Eskom power plants reportedly out of action due to strike action and the potential for power outages looming, football fans could be forgiven for nervously watching the clock. The opening ceremony of the 2018 FIFA World Cup starts at 16:30, with the kickoff of the Russia vs Saudi Arabia opener at 17:00. If the power does go out, DStv customers have a secret weapon to keep watching all the action. All the World Cup games can be streamed live on the DStv Now app, which is free to all DStv Premium, Compact, and Compact Plus customers. Those who donâ€™t have DStv still have an option to access DStv Now. The login details from each qualifying DStv subscription can be used to access the DStv Now app on two different devices simultaneously. The app works on smartphones and tablets, and can also be accessed on a laptop using a web browser. As long as a family member has those DStv login details and is willing to share, then watching the game is as simple as downloading the Android or iOS app and signing in. Go to now.dstv.com for more.
