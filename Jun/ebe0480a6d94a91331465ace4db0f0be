Apple has strengthened its App Store guidelines for developers, explicitly stating they are not allowed to share user contacts. If an Apple developer creates a database of any user’s contacts and shares or sells that information without their consent, they will be banned from the developer programme and their content will be removed from the App Store. Applications will still be able to collect this data, but they must prompt the user for consent and tell them exactly what they will do with the data. Developers are responsible for ensuring their apps operate within Apple’s guidelines, and apps which previously collected and shared this data without user consent must change the operations of their apps. The update to Apple’s guidelines follows Facebook’s recent data leak, where a third-party application obtained and shared a database of user information.
