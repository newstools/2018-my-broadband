Microsoft is adding native ad-blocking to its Edge beta browser for Android and iOS, TheNextWeb reported. The browser will feature a built-in version of AdBlock Plus, which is one of the most popular ad-blockers. As this software will now be natively-integrated in the browser, users will not have to download additional applications to use AdBlock Plus features. Microsoft said the feature has started rolling out to the beta versions of its Edge app for Android. Native AdBlock Plus integration for Edge will roll out for iOS users in a separate test programme. Microsoftâ€™s Edge app has received over five million downloads on the Google Play Store, following its official launch for the platform earlier this year.
