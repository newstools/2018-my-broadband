Twitter has announced a number of new measures to fight spam and malicious automation. The social media platform aims to crack down on trolls, bots, and abuse by implementing a number of tools across its online service. Twitter said it actively fights spam and malicious automation by identifying problematic accounts and behaviour, using machine learning tools to automatically take down networks of automated spam accounts. “This lets us tackle attempts to manipulate conversations on Twitter at scale, across languages and time zones, without relying on reactive reports,” said the company. These measures are reducing the number of total spam accounts on the platform, it said. In an effort to deter spam accounts from registering, Twitter has also improved its sign-up process – requiring new users to confirm an email address or phone number when they register.
