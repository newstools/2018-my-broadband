Security company Snyk has disclosed a vulnerability affecting applications that extract archived files, which may be exploited to extract malicious programs to a target system. The vulnerability allows an attacker to archive a malicious program which masquerades as an executable that their target web application will run. While archiving the program into a .zip or similar file format, the attacker configures it so their malicious program overwrites the executable they are targeting. The vulnerability is exploited using a specially-crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. ../../evil.sh). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including tar, jar, war, cpio, apk, rar, and 7z. Snyk said the vulnerability has been found in multiple ecosystems, including JavaScript, Ruby, .NET and Go, and is prevalent in Java – where there is no central library offering high-level processing of archive files. “The lack of such a library led to vulnerable code snippets being hand crafted and shared among developer communities such as StackOverflow,” said Snyk. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
