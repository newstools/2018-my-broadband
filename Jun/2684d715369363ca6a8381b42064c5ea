Google has improved its ad personalisation platform which shows users what info is used about them for targeted ads. The ad personalisation platform also makes it easier for users to change this personal information and reduce targeted ads linked to this info. Google stated that it personalises ads based on a user’s activity online, but that it does not sell this information to anyone. “Google makes your ads more useful on Google services – like Search and YouTube – and on websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads,” said the company. Google informed users they can install a browser plugin to maintain their preference to opt out of personalised ads from Google. “If you use this browser plugin, the same number of ads will appear on websites that you look at. The plugin turns off ads personalisation. Turning off personalisation makes ads less relevant to you,” it said.
