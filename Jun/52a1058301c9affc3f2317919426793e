Computicket’s website has folded under pressure from users to buy Ed Sheeran concert tickets. The platform opened ticket sales for Sheeran’s concert in Cape Town yesterday, and suffered downtime when users attempted to use its services. “Public tickets have been placed on hold due to technical difficulties. We will advise as soon as the problem has been resolved,” stated the company yesterday morning. This morning, 29 June 2018, Computicket opened ticket sales for Sheeran’s concert in Johannesburg, with two show days available. As with the Cape Town show, the site has fallen over as users attempted to buy tickets for the Johannesburg dates. Hundreds of users reported problems accessing the site and buying tickets, resorting to Twitter to vent their frustrations. During the downtime this morning, Computicket stated it was experiencing “high traffic” to its site. “Tickets for the 1st Ed Sheeran show are limited, however there is still availability for the 2nd show. Please be patient and keep trying until,” said the company on Twitter. It was also observed that Computicket’s URL changed from “online.computicket.com” to “static.computicket.com” soon after the Johannesburg ticket sales opened. The change may have been implemented to move users from the usual Computicket server to a different server to accommodate them. MyBroadband contacted Computicket for comment, but emails to three employees at the “@computicket.com” domain all returned “Mail delivery failed” errors.
