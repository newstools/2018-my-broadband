Valve has announced a new policy around policing content on Steam. The policy is a hands-off approach which aims to allow as much content as possible, barring anything illegal or games which are “straight up trolling”. Valve said it should not choose what developers are allowed to create and what players are allowed to play. “If you’re a developer, we shouldn’t be choosing what content you’re allowed to create. Those choices should be yours to make,” said Valve. “Our role should be to provide systems and tools to support your efforts to make these choices for yourself, and to help you do it in a way that makes you feel comfortable.” “With that principle in mind, we’ve decided that the right approach is to allow everything onto the Steam Store, except for things that we decide are illegal, or straight up trolling.” This means the Steam Store may contain content specific users want removed from the platform. The company said it would continue to work on policing content on Steam for the foreseeable future.
