The Xbox One could soon receive support for Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, according to a report by Windows Central. A source leaked a screenshot of the Xbox One Preferences interfaces to Windows Central, detailing the options for digital assistants in an upcoming build. The menu states that turning digital assistants on allows the user to “Use a digital assistant like Cortana, Alexa, or Google Assistant with your Xbox”. Users can currently use a headset to speak to Microsoft’s Cortana on the Xbox One, but the new features would bring an easier and more intuitive digital assistant experience to the console, the report stated. The Alexa voice control feature will reportedly also be compatible with Amazon Echo smart speakers.
