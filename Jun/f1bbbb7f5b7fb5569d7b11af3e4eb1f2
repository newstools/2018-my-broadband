The Snapdragon 439 and 429 will be equipped with AI capabilities to enhance the camera, voice, and security experience, added Qualcomm. Also built with FinFET process technology, the Snapdragon 439 and 429 will feature an X6 LTE modem. The Snapdragon 439 then features an octa-core CPU and Adreno 505 GPU, while the Snapdragon 429 will use an Adreno 504 GPU.
