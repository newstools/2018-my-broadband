Google has banned the use of its artificial intelligence technology in weapons or surveillance violating internationally-accepted norms, said CEO Sundar Pichai in a blog post. This follows a revolt from employees who resigned in protest over the company’s partnership with the Pentagon for Project Maven. Project Maven aimed to speed up the analysis of drone footage by automatically classifying images of objects and people. Employees who resigned raised ethical questions about using artificial intelligence in drone warfare. While Google has stated it will not use its technology in the development of weapons, Pichai said they will continue to work with governments on other projects. “These include cybersecurity, training, military recruitment, veterans’ healthcare, and search and rescue. These collaborations are important and we’ll actively look for more ways to augment the critical work of these organisations and keep service members and civilians safe,” he said.
