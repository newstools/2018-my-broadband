SpaceX and its Falcon Heavy rocket have won a $130-million launch contract with the US Air Force, TechCrunch reported. The contract includes the production of a launch vehicle, integration, launch operations, and spaceflight worthiness activities, according to the original bid notice. This means Elon Musk’s private space company will be responsible for the launch of the Air Force Space Command-52 satellite into its intended orbit. The US Department of Defence received two proposals for its tender in a competitive bidding process. According to the report, the plan is for the mission to launch from Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, and work on the mission is set to be completed by September 2020. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy launch vehicle conducted its first successful test flight earlier this year, carrying Elon Musk’s cherry-red Tesla Roadster into orbit.
