Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) released its General Household Survey 2017, which shows that only one-tenth of South African households have access to the Internet at home. The report shows that home Internet access was most prevalent among households in the Western Cape (25.7%) and Gauteng (16.5%), and lowest in Limpopo (2.2%) and Eastern Cape (3.5%). While 17.4% of households in metropolitan areas had access to the Internet at home, this was true for less than one per cent of rural households in Limpopo, Eastern Cape, and North West. However, 61.8% of South African households had at least one member who had access to, or used the Internet either at home, work, place of study or Internet cafés. “People were generally more likely to have access to the Internet at work than at home,” Stats SA said. Access to the Internet using all available means – including smartphones and access at work – was highest in Gauteng (74.0%), Western Cape (70.8%) and Mpumalanga (63.3%), and lowest in Limpopo (43.6%) and Eastern Cape (51.8%). The charts below show the percentage of households with access to the Internet at home.
