MWEB announced it is handing over its GameZone website, along with its associated content, media, and entertainment, to GeekXP. The ISP said it will continue to focus its efforts on online network experience and events within the gaming community, however. MWEB said it would continue to host a number of gaming servers, and events in its M-Cave in Cape Town. GeekXP owner Les Allen said they will provide local pop culture fans with access to content and experiences they would otherwise not be able to enjoy. Allen joined the team behind ICON Comics and Games Convention in 2015, bringing international guests and live streaming panels to the South African market. “MWEB is excited to work closely with GeekXP, ensuring that gamers on the MWEB network enjoy the best possible gaming experience,” said MWEB. The GameZone brand, website, and social media pages will be transferred to GeekXP on 1 July 2018
