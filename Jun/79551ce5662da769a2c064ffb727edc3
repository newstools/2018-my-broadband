Netflix is the streaming service of choice for South Africans, according to the MyBroadband 2018 DStv and Netflix Survey. The 2018 DStv and Netflix Survey was taken by 9,857 MyBroadband readers and forum members. The respondents are therefore tech-savvy individuals, meaning the survey results are indicative of what South Africans with a knowledge of the TV and streaming space think. Netflix was the top pick when it came to streaming services, followed by Showmax, and Amazon Prime Video. An interesting result was that of those who subscribed to Netflix, 41% had the Premium package. The Netflix Premium package costs $11.99 per month and lets users watch on four devices at the same time – all in UHD. 42% of Netflix subscribers were on the Standard package, which costs $9.99 per month, goes up to HD resolution, can can be used on two devices at the same time. Netflix subscribers also stated they were happy with the service, with 95% having no plans to cancel their subscription in 2018. Another interesting finding was that the percentage of respondents subscribed to Showmax was higher among DStv subscribers, compared to the “all respondents” result. This is likely due to MultiChoice bundling Showmax with DStv Premium for free. DStv Compact and Compact Plus users also receive a discount for Showmax with their subscription, priced at R49 per month. Showmax’s normal price is R99 per month. 26% of all streaming service subscribers said they watch an average 5-10 hours of content per week, while 19% of respondents said they watched over 20 hours of content per week.
