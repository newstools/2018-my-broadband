Tesla has filed a lawsuit against former employee Martin Tripp for allegedly stealing gigabytes of proprietary data, CNBC reports. The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday 20 June and claims that Tripp admitted to writing software which hacked Tesla’s manufacturing operating system and transferred confidential data outside of the company. According to the lawsuit, this data included confidential photographs and a video of Tesla’s manufacturing systems. Tripp joined Tesla in October 2017 as a process technician, and Tesla said he was combative and disruptive with other employees during his time at the company. The company also alleged that Tripp made false statements to the media, including claims that Tesla used punctured battery cells in some Model 3 vehicles and that the company was delayed in bringing new manufacturing equipment online. This follows an internal email CEO Elon Musk sent to staff which stated that a disgruntled employee conducted “extensive and damaging sabotage” by leaking sensitive data to unknown third parties after breaking in to the company’s manufacturing operating system.
