Employees at Amazon are circulating a letter addressed to CEO Jeff Bezos asking him to stop selling the company’s facial recognition technology to law enforcement, Gizmodo reported. The letter also demands that Amazon cancels the services it provides to Palantir, which is said to power systems used by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE). This protest at Amazon follows similar employee action at Google and Microsoft. Following a revolt from Google employees, which saw several workers resign in protest over the company’s partnership with the Pentagon for Project Maven, Google banned the use of its artificial intelligence technology in weapons or surveillance which violates internationally-accepted norms. Project Maven aimed to speed up the analysis of drone footage by automatically classifying images of objects and people. Employees who resigned raised ethical questions about using artificial intelligence in drone warfare. The protest at Microsoft is more recent and also involves ICE, Gizmodo reported, with employees calling on the company to cancel a contract with the US law enforcement agency.
