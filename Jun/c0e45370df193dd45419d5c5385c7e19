Microsoft is rolling out stylus support to its Mail app for Windows 10, The Verge reported. The company’s addition of Windows Ink improved the functionality of the operating system for stylus users, and it has now added the ability to use a stylus in its Mail app. Users who prefer using a stylus to a keyboard will now be able to write messages in the app, similarly to how they would use Windows Ink. This feature is currently available for Windows Insiders with the latest preview build, and will be included in the next major Windows 10 update – set for September 2018. Other features available in the Windows 10 Insider preview build include the SwiftKey touch keyboard.
