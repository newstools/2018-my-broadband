Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe has stated there will be stage 1 load shedding tonight, 14 June 2018. “Due to severe power constraints, Eskom will implement stage 1 of load shedding from now (17:50) until 20:00,” he said in a tweet. “Acts of intimidation and sabotage have resulted in Eskom being unable to ensure uninterrupted power supply.” Eskom is currently facing strike action from employees who are members of NUM and Numsa, after its decision to cut salary increases this year. The load shedding comes a week after Eskom stated it needs to drastically increase the price of electricity.
