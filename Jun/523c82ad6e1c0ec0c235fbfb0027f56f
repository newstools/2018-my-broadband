Cell C has launched a new winter promotion for its C-Fibre and Black services. From 1 June 2018 until 31 August 2018, customers signing up for a new C-Fibre line will benefit from three-months of free fibre, and free access to Binge Premium on Black. Cell C said customers signing up for a 40Mbps line or faster will also receive a free Wi-Fi router valued at R1,699, along with free installation and connection. Cell C will also give fibre customers a free Black set-top box valued at R1,499. “Our new winter promotion will ensure customers stay connected and entertained for longer and at faster speeds in the comfort of their homes,” said Cell C executive head for broadband Dederick Venter. The promotion is valid across all the fibre networks where C-Fibre offers services.
