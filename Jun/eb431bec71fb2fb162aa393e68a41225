Vodacom has released its integrated report for the year ended 31 March 2018. The report covers multiple aspects of the company’s financial performance, including how much its top executives were paid over its past financial year. Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub took home R50.2 million for the year, up from R40.8 million in the 2017 financial year. With his big salary comes a massive tax bill, however, and Vodacom stated that Joosub’s post-tax remuneration was R27.6 million – meaning his tax bill comes to just under R23 million. Vodacom CFO Till Streichert earned just over R2 million in the company’s 2018 financial year.
