Naspers has released its financial results for the year ended 31 March 2018, which shows a big decline in MultiChoice’s DStv Premium subscribers. Over the last year, MultiChoice’s DStv subscribers grew from 11.942 million to 13.476 million – an increase of 13%. Most of this growth came from lower-end subscribers, which shows that MultiChoice’s mass-market growth is continuing. MultiChoice’s high-end subscribers – DStv Premium – have declined from 1.962 million to 1.921 million over the last year. This equates to a loss of 41,000 DStv Premium subscribers in one year. Naspers said its “mass market growth trend continues, premium tier growth is declining and compact tier growth is starting to stabilize”. This loss of high-end subscribers also drove down the average revenue per user (ARPU) from R353 per month to R344 per month. The image below shows the decline in DStv Premium subscribers over the last year. It should be noted that these figures reflect all MultiChoice’s subscribers, and not just South Africa.
