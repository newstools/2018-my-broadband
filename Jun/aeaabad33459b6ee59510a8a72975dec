Telkom has appointed Tsholofelo Molefe as Group Chief Financial Officer, effective from 1 July 2018, the company announced in a statement. Molefe will inherit the position from Deon Fredericks, who will assume the position of chief investment officer at Telkom. Molefe is a qualified chartered accountant who joined Telkom in July 2016 and was appointed as chief risk and compliance officer in April 2017. As chief investment officer, Fredericks will now focus on Telkom’s investments and ensure the group continues to grow. “Our most recent set of annual financial results shows that our new revenue streams are beginning to offset Telkom’s traditional revenue streams. This confirms that we made the right investment decisions at the right time,” said Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko. “Deon’s experience, intimate knowledge of the business, and our resource allocation philosophy makes him an ideal candidate to drive our investment strategy following his positive contribution to the turnaround phase of the business.”
