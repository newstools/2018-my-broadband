Google has added a new option to its Calendar which allows users to mark events as “out of office”. The feature is available when creating a new event, and includes the ability to add automated decline messages. The messages will automatically decline meeting requests with a preset message, and users will be able to customise the visibility of their “out of office event”. Google said it will also attempt to intelligently detect whether an event entered into Calendar should be set as an out of office event. Calendar now also includes the ability to set your working hours and automatically decline meeting requests for events which take place outside of these hours. Additionally, a user’s working hours, based on their time zone and scheduling patterns, can be inferred. The new Google Calendar features will begin rolling out to all users this week.
