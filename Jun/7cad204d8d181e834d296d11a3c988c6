Amazon has unveiled its Fire TV Cube – a hands-free 4K Ultra HD streaming media player with Alexa built in. The Fire TV Cube uses multi-directional infrared technology, cloud-based protocols, and HDMI CEC for entertainment equipment control. These technologies, combined with Alexa, mean that users can control their TV, sound bar, and decoder with voice commands. Using Alexa’s voice controls, users can switch their TV on and off, change the volume, switch inputs, and change the channel. “Even with the TV off, simply say Alexa, play Billions on Showtime and Fire TV Cube powers on your TV and starts playback right where you left off,” said Amazon. Amazon Fire TV Cube also uses far-field voice recognition with eight microphones to ensure Alexa clearly hears requests from across a room. Advanced beam-forming technology combines the signals from the individual microphones to suppress noise, reverberation, content currently playing, and competing speech. The Amazon Fire TV Cube is available for pre-order for $119.99, and ships with an IR extender cable and Ethernet adapter. Shipping starts on 21 June 2018.
