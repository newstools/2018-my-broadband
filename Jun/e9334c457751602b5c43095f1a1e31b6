Apple has unveiled macOS Mojave at its WWDC 2018 conference in San Jose, California. A much-anticipated feature which was launched was Dark Mode for the latest version of macOS. Dark Mode provides dark-themed interfaces in macOS windows and apps like Apple Music. Xcode will also feature a Dark Mode theme, said Apple. Another new visual feature in Mojave is “Dynamic Desktop”, which changes the desktop wallpaper based on the time of day. Sticking with the desktop, Apple introduced desktop stacking in Mojave – letting users automatically stack desktop items into piles of similar content. Finder upgrades were also on show, with a new “gallery view” previewed by Apple. Gallery view provides a big preview of files without opening them in Finder, and includes full metadata for files like images. Other upgrades to Finder include new quick-look functionality, such as editing options for photos and videos. Screenshots has also been upgraded to show previews of screenshots just after they are taken, which can be opened in a window with tools for editing. Other announcements for macOS were: Apple said macOS Mojave will provide more than just visual changes, and will feature a new Mac app store. The new store includes a ratings and review API, and new apps – such as Office 365 from Microsoft. Privacy and security upgrades to macOS and Safari were also detailed. Apple said Safari will now ask users by default if they want a site to send them cookies, and macOS will make it more difficult for data companies to create an online fingerprint of a user’s machine. The developer preview of macOS Mojave is available in the Apple Developer Program now, with a public beta coming in late June. MacOS Mojave will be fully available in the coming months for Macs introduced in mid-2012 or later, plus 2010 and 2012 Mac Pro models with recommended Metal-capable graphics cards.
