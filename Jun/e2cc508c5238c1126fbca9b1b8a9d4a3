Intel vice president of technology, systems architecture, and client group Asha Keddy has confirmed they will make phone modems for Apple’s upcoming iPhones, the Nikkei Asian review reported. “To be honest, we have a late start. But now, I believe we’ve caught up and later we want to lead in 5G,” said Keddy. Dubbed the XMM 7560, the report speculates Apple would be a big customer for its modem chip. Data download speeds of up to 1Gbps would be supported, and Keddy described the XMM 7560 as a milestone for Intel – as it supports code division multiple access technology, which is used by US networks. While Intel has supplied chips to Apple before, this will be the first time it produces them in-house. In 2016 and 2017, it outsourced production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The potential deal follows Apple and Qualcomm’s wide-ranging legal battle over royalty payments. Bloomberg reported that there are more than 50 intellectual property and antitrust proceedings filed across 16 jurisdictions in six countries in the fight.
