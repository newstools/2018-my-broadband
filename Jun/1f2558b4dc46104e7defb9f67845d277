Google Chromecast and Home devices suffered extended downtime on 27 June 2018, The Guardian reported. As more device owners reported problems, it became evident the issue was not isolated. People reported being unable to stream on Chromecast, or use Chromecast to connect to other devices. Google Home devices responded to queries with “There was a glitch, try again in a few seconds”. By 20:46 last night, Google confirmed the reports were a result of a glitch on its side, and that it was working on it. Just after midnight, Google said a fix for its devices will roll out automatically over the next six hours. Those who wanted to get the fix sooner could manually reboot their devices, said Google. According to the report, Google has not indicated what caused the extended outage.
