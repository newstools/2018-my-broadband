Rain has launched its mobile products in South Africa, offering users a flat rate of 5c per MB (R50 per GB). The mobile products also include unlimited data for a certain number of days following their purchase, and the option to add on a 19-hour-per-day uncapped mobile usage bundle. The launch of the mobile products follow the unveiling of Rain’s fixed LTE-A packages in 2017, which offer a fixed-line alternative for broadband users. To see how Rain’s new mobile SIMs perform compared to its existing fixed LTE-A products, we conducted a series of speed tests. A Rain Mobile SIM and a Rain fixed LTE-A SIM were each placed in a Huawei B618 router. The routers were placed side-by-side and connected to a Windows 10 PC via an Ethernet cable, after which multiple speeds tests using MyBroadband’s web-based Speed Test page – accessed in Chrome – were conducted. The tests were conducted on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and besides an initial discrepancy in speeds, the Rain Mobile SIM kept up with the Rain fixed LTE-A SIM – as shown below.
