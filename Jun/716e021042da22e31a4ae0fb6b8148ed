Fibre is spreading across South Africa, with an increasing number of people switching to the fast technology. While it is the connectivity option of choice for many users, there are still large areas where fibre has not been rolled out. Suburbs without fibre often see residents using DSL connections instead, or fixed LTE packages if coverage is good. DSL packages have also decreased in price in recent years, and can deliver speeds of up to 40Mbps if you live close enough to an MSAN. Fixed LTE is also a great solution for high-speed Internet in areas without fibre, but data packages can be slightly more expensive. If you are looking for a DSL or LTE solution, a range of great packages available in South Africa are listed below. The price for each package below includes the Openserve DSL line rental component. It should be noted that ISPs offer different uncapped package tiers with different shaping and throttling policies. Telkom’s analogue landline rental is also not included in the price, which costs R200.74 per month. Fixed LTE-A – from the likes of Rain, Cell C, and Telkom – and can theoretically deliver download speeds over 150Mbps. While each ISP quotes different expected speeds for their LTE-A products, our tests show that Rain’s fixed LTE-A product delivers download speeds of between 25-42Mbps with low latency. To make use of an LTE-A network, users are required to use a SIM and compatible router. Afrihost’s Huawei LTE-A router is available for R999 when subscribing to a Rain fixed-LTE product, for example. Telkom automatically bundles free LTE routers with its products when the customer selects a 24-month contract.
