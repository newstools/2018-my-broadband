Apple has confirmed that a small percentage of the keyboards in its recent MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops may encounter issues with sticking or broken keys. The company said it would service eligible keyboards free of charge following an examination of the hardware. This worldwide free repair programme applies to the following devices: To identify your product information and determine whether it is eligible for a free keyboard repair, access the About This Mac page under the Apple menu. Users can visit any Apple authorised service provider to have their keyboard repaired, a process which may involve the replacement of individual keys or the entire keyboard. Apple said this programme does not extend the standard warranty coverage of MacBook or MacBook Pro devices, and users who paid to have this problem fixed can contact Apple regarding a refund.
