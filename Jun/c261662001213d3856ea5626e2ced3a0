In the business market it is extremely important to have reliable and fast Internet access – both in the office and on your smartphone. This is why thousands of businesses use MTN, which has been rated as the best mobile network in South Africa. MTN was ranked as the best and fastest mobile network in MyBroadband’s Q4 2017 and Q1 2018 Mobile Network Quality Reports. The reports are based on hundreds of thousands of speed tests, which were performed by thousands of MyBroadband Android Speed Test app users across South Africa. MTN was also rated as the best network by the German-based P3 Communications, which provides technology consulting and testing services for mobile networks. P3 Communications’ research is based on 9,000 voice tests per operator and 2,600 data tests per operator in cities, towns, and on roads. MTN’s excellent network rankings did not happen by chance. Over the past three years, it has invested over R30 billion in its network and its network rollout in 2017 was the largest in South Africa’s history. MTN now has a 3G population coverage of 98%, and a 4G population coverage of 83%. They have also increased their average data throughput, with 3G speeds improving by 17%, while LTE speeds increased by 2% over the past year. MTN made sure its voice network performs well, too, and dropped calls on MTN’s 2G network decreased 23% compared to last year, and 3G dropped calls have seen a 40% decrease. To determine the best mobile network in South Africa, a “Network Quality Score” was calculated by MyBroadband for each network using a range of performance measurements from its Speed Test results. The Network Quality Score out of 10 shows how the network performed in relation to other networks. MTN won nationally with a Network Quality Score of 9.92, followed by Vodacom on 9.01, Cell C on 6.72, and Telkom on 6.54.  MTN has the best network in Gauteng, with a Network Quality Score of 9.99, followed by Vodacom on 9.34, Cell C on 7.37, and Telkom on 6.18.
