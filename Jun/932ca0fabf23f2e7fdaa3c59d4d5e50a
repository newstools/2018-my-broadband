Paul Butschi and Andre Jooste started Cool Ideas in 2011, and since then the company has morphed from offering backup and cloud storage services into a popular fibre ISP. The company is aggressively growing its subscriber base and recently moved into new offices in Rosebank to accommodate its growth. Butschi has a long history in the IT space. He started as an on-site support technician, and later served as an IT administrator and IT manager. We are giving you an opportunity to ask Paul anything about Cool Ideas and the ISP and FTTH market in South Africa. He will select around 10 questions to answer. He will also name the best question, and the person who asked this question will win a Google Chromecast. To take part in the discussion and post a question, visit the MyBroadband forum link below.
