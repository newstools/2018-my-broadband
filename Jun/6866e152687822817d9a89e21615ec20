Intel is developing a new type of quantum processor which uses “spin qubits”. The new chip runs at extremely low temperatures and features small qubits, which are around 50nm wide. While the technology is still in its infancy, Intel said the smaller size of the qubits could allow the design for its new spin qubit chip to be scaled up dramatically. “Future quantum computers will contain thousands or even millions of qubits – and will be vastly more powerful than today’s fastest supercomputers,” said Intel.
