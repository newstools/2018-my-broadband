LinkedIn has introduced a new QR code feature which allows users to easily connect with others when meeting in person. The QR code feature is available in the LinkedIn app, and allows users to scan the code of people they meet to quickly add them to their LinkedIn network. To scan a QR code, users tap the QR code icon in the search box on the LinkedIn Home tab. After scanning, they will be directed to the user’s profile and will be able to send a connection request. To find your own LinkedIn QR code, select the “My code” option. Users can also share their code through messaging apps and email, or save the image to their image library. LinkedIn QR codes are available in the LinkedIn iOS and Android applications.
