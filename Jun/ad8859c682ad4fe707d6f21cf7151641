The AfroVoice newspaper is shutting down with immediate effect, according to a report from News24. The newspaper’s – formerly known as The New Age – employees were said to have received the news during a staff meeting this week, delivered by owner Mzwanele Manyi. According to an IOL report, staff were told that the newspaper was being closed down “due to some legal issues”. Manyi reportedly promised staff the company would pay their June salaries, despite the newspaper not being printed. Manyi acquired The New Age and news channel ANN7 last year, renaming the entities AfroVoice and Afro Worldview respectively. Both the newspaper and news channel were previously owned by companies linked to the Gupta family.
