Rain launched its first mobile products on 6 June 2018, offering data priced at 5c per MB (R50 per GB). As part of its launch promotion, users were offered unlimited data usage for between 15 and 90 days after joining, depending on the product purchased. Many people ordered Rain SIMs and device bundles to test the network, and were promised a delivery date and time. However, users have been informed that Rain is experiencing a delay and that they will not receive their orders as promised. In an SMS message to new customers, the company said it will be “in touch to confirm a delivery time”, without any indication of when the delivery will happen. A MyBroadband forum discussion showed that no one who ordered their SIMs has received them – and that support through the Rain website was proving problematic. Rain CEO Willem Roos said the delay was caused by higher-than-expected order volumes, along with technical issues. “We hope the delay will be at most two or three days, and we are working around the clock to address the problems,” said Roos. He advised customers who have problems with deliveries to email support@rain.co.za.
