Tarsus Distribution has launched the Tarsus Express Delivery service, which enables ICT resellers to deliver orders within two hours. The new logistics service means customers who buy products through supported resellers can receive urgent small orders on the same day they place their order. Tarsus Express is fulfilled through Sender and is available within a 30km radius of the Tarsus Distribution Hub in Woodmead, Johannesburg. The service costs R85 per delivery and is available Monday to Friday from 08:00-17:00, with a cut-off time of 15:00 for same-day delivery. Both the reseller and customer will receive SMS alerts as the delivery progresses. “With this new service, we enable our resellers to speed up fulfilment of emergency orders, in turn delighting their customers with rapid turnaround times when they need urgent help to keep their business running smoothly,” said Tarsus GM for channel sales Shirlinia Jacobs. Tarsus said the service is available for a selection of products that customers need most often at short notice, which are listed on the Tarsus Distribution Portal.
