The debate around MultiChoice’s DStv and streaming service Netflix reached a high point recently when MultiChoice stated that Netflix must pay tax in South Africa. The company added that if ICASA passes heavy-handed regulations in the local TV market, thousands of jobs may be lost. Many MyBroadband readers and forum members stated that MultiChoice’s market dominance must be addressed, and said the company has had an easy run in the country up until now. While many were quick to knock DStv and its offerings, MyBroadband’s 2018 DStv and Netflix Survey has revealed that many people still subscribe to DStv. The 2018 DStv and Netflix Survey was taken by 9,857 MyBroadband readers and forum members. The respondents are therefore tech-savvy individuals, meaning the survey results are indicative of what South Africans with a knowledge of the TV and streaming space think. The standout result from the DStv section of the survey was that 55% of the respondents subscribed to DStv. Of this group, 60% were subscribed to DStv Premium – the most expensive package. Respondents said they mainly watched sport (59%) and series (53%) on DStv, two segments where DStv has exclusive offerings compared to competing services. The majority of DStv subscribers said they watched 5-10 hours of the service per week, while 14% said they watched over 20 hours per week. Another standout figure was that 47% of respondents said they planned to cancel their DStv subscription this year, while 11% were unsure about the future of their subscription. Of those who do not subscribe to DStv, only 3% said they planned to sign up for a package this year. The results of the survey are detailed in the graphic below.
