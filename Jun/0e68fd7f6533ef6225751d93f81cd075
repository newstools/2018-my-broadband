Using a recently-released crack for the Nintendo Switch to pirate games will get your console banned as soon as you connect to Nintendo’s online services. This is according to Nintendo hacker SciresM, who posted the findings of their investigation into the Nintendo’s anti-piracy protection on Reddit. SciresM’s work follows the release of the ReSwitched and ShofEL2 bootROM exploits for the Nintendo Switch, which allows hackers to run homebrew content on their consoles. However, it can also theoretically allow pirate games to be played on the Switch, which would be a concern for Nintendo. Despite the unpatchable exploit discovered in the bootROM for Nvidia Tegra X1-based devices, such as the Switch, Nintendo has other anti-piracy measures in place to dissuade owners of its console from cracking their devices. According to SciresM, Nintendo employs extremely strong anti-piracy measures, and bans consoles from its online services when it detects chicanery. In the case of digital games, Nintendo perfectly prevents online piracy, SciresM said. “Tickets cannot be forged, and Nintendo can verify that the device ID in the ticket matches the device ID for the client certificate connecting (banning on a mismatch), as well as that the account ID for the ticket matches the Nintendo Account authorising to log in,” the said. “Users who pirate games definitionally cannot have well-signed tickets for their consoles, and thus cannot connect online without getting an immediate ban — this is exactly how I would have implemented authorization for digital games, if I were them.”
