Google has announced that the redesigned version of Gmail will be available to everyone in July as part of its general availability (GA) launch. In April, Google unveiled a new design for Gmail, which features a more modern look, advanced security features, artificial intelligence, and more integrations with other G Suite apps. Gmail has also added a “confidential mode”, which lets users protect sensitive content in emails by creating expiration dates or revoking previously-sent messages. Google said it has redesigned its security warnings in Gmail, too, so information is easier to see and understand. Google has already launched the new Gmail through its Early Adopter Program (EAP), and will make it available to everyone by next month. 8 weeks after the general availability launch in July, all users who are still using the older Gmail will be automatically migrated to the new version. For those who would like more time with the “old” Gmail, they have the option to opt out of the new Gmail for an additional four weeks.
