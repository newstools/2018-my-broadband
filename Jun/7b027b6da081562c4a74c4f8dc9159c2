Fujifilm has released its retro-inspired Instax SHARE SP-3 smartphone printer in South Africa. The device allows users with a dedicated Instax Share app to style images and print photos on Instax film, which features a 1:1 aspect ratio â€“ the format popularised by Instagram. The battery-powered printer is compact and lightweight, and is available in black and white.  The Instax Share app is intuitive and easy to use, and includes My Template, a feature that allows users to edit images before printing. My Template includes various pre-designed templates, including a magazine cover and a CD jacket. Users can also as add text, create collages, add filters, and adjust the colour and contrast of images.  Images can be printed in 13 seconds via a Wi-Fi connection from a smartphone, or from a social media account such as Instagram, Facebook, Google Photos, flickr, or Dropbox. A social networking template can then add the social media logo, user profile picture, and number of likes to the printed image. Users can also share edited images to their preferred social media accounts, email accounts, or chat applications.  The handheld printer is available from leading local retailers for the recommended retail price of R3,500. The free Instax Share app is available on both the Google Play store and Apple App Store. The full specifications of the Instax SHARE SP-3 are detailed below.  This article was published in partnership with Fujifilm.
