Qualcomm has unveiled its Snapdragon 850 processor, which was designed for always-connected Windows 10 PCs. The Snapdragon 850 succeeds the Snapdragon 835, and promises increased performance, improved battery life, and better connectivity. The Snapdragon 850 also features an X20 LTE modem, which supports connectivity speeds of up to 1.2Gbps. Qualcomm said the Snapdragon 850 will have enhanced entertainment features, too, including virtual surround sound, native DSD support, aptX HD, and 4K capture. One of the first manufacturers to use the new chip is Samsung, which will produce Windows 10 PCs with the 850. “The Snapdragon 850 Mobile Compute Platform will allow us to provide always-on, always-connected mobile computing experiences for our customers,” said Samsung’s executive vice president Kyungsik Choi.
