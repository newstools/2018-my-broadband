Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has resigned his position as CEO and a member of the company’s board of directors. “Intel was recently informed that Mr. Krzanich had a past consensual relationship with an Intel employee,” the company said in a statement. “An ongoing investigation by internal and external counsel has confirmed a violation of Intel’s non-fraternization policy, which applies to all managers.” Krzanich held the Intel CEO post since May 2013 and had been employed at the company for over 35 years. Intel said it has appointed chief financial officer Robert Swan as interim CEO, effective immediately. Swan has been CFO since October 2016 and previously spent nine years as CFO of eBay. “The board believes strongly in Intel’s strategy and we are confident in Bob Swan’s ability to lead the company as we conduct a robust search for our next CEO,” Intel said.
