Instagram is adding a feature which allows users to implement soundtracks in Stories. Users will now be able to add a soundtrack to their story, selecting a track from a library of thousands of songs. After tapping to add a sticker to a photo or video in Stories, users will see a music icon â€“ which they can select to add a soundtrack to their content. The song library can be searched and sorted by mood and genre, and users are able to seek through a track and select the segment they want to include in their story. Viewers will then hear the soundtrack playing as they watch the story content. Instagram said its soundtrack feature is currently available in selected countries, and the ability to select a track before capturing video is currently only available on iOS. Android support is rolling out soon, it added.
