Intel has unveiled its special-edition Core i7-8086K desktop processor at Computex 2018. According to a report from Tom’s Hardware, Intel will give away 8,086 of the limited edition CPUs via an online portal which is yet to go live. The chip is similar to the Intel Core i7-8700K and is compatible with the LGA 1151 v2 socket, meaning it will work with Intel 300-series chipsets. The Core i7-8086K has been unveiled almost exactly 40 years after the launch of Intel’s original 8086 processor, although the newer version will be overclockable and sports much more impressive specifications. Intel’s original 8086 processor was shipped on 8 June 1978, and boasted a single core with a 5MHz base clock speed, boosting up to 10MHz. The chipmaker has not yet revealed the price or launch date of the new processor.
