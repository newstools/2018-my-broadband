Valve will partner with Chinese developer Perfect World to launch its Steam platform in China, Engadget reported. The companies have previously worked together on the standalone releases of Dota 2 and CS: GO in China, and will now collaborate on the marketing and launch of the Steam service in the country. Steam user data implies there are many gamers playing a variety of games from China, but most of these products are sold without official government approval. By partnering with a local business like Perfect World, Valve could soon be able to officially offer the products on its Steam platform to Chinese users. There is currently no release date for Steam in China.
