Netflix Inc.’s top spokesman is leaving the company after using a racial slur in a work setting. Jonathan Friedland, chief communications officer, said on Twitter Friday that he’s stepping down following “insensitive” comments he made to colleagues. He used a derogatory term for black people twice in the past year, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg. “His descriptive use of the N-word on at least two occasions at work showed unacceptably low racial awareness and sensitivity, and is not in line with our values as a company,” Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings wrote in the memo. Friedland joins the growing ranks of high-profile officials who have been forced out over their behavior. Intel Corp. removed Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich this week following revelations that he had a consensual relationship with an employee. At Athenahealth Inc., CEO Jonathan Bush stepped down this month after a series of allegations about misconduct involving women. Friedland didn’t respond to a request for comment Friday, but he alluded to his transgressions in a series of tweets. “Leaders have to be beyond reproach in the example we set and unfortunately I fell short of that standard when I was insensitive in speaking to my team about words that offend in comedy,” Friedland said. “I feel awful about the distress this lapse caused to people at a company I love and where I want everyone to feel included and appreciated.”
