Oppo has unveiled its new bezel-less smartphone, the Oppo Find X. The device sports an impressive 93.8% screen-to-body ratio, with tiny bezels and no visible notch at the top of the display. Instead of housing its front camera and sensors in a thick bezel or a notch at the top of the device, the camera is housed behind the display and slides up when required. This allows for the camera system to be completely hidden when the device is turned off, or the camera app is closed. Oppo did not include fingerprint authentication support on the device, and the smartphone uses traditional unlock methods and 3D facial scanning for security. The Oppo Find X is currently available in China, and will launch in the in the US later this year. There is currently no international pricing for the device.
