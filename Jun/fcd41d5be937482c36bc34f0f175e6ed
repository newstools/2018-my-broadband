Samsung will launch the Galaxy Note 9 in August, and will offer a 512GB storage model, Softpedia reported. The previous version of the device, the Galaxy Note 8, offered 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of onboard storage – and a microSD slot which could handle 256GB. The report did not state whether the Galaxy Note 9 will support a microSD card for expandable storage. Users in South Korea and China are expected to receive the 512GB model first, with a global rollout not yet confirmed. The Note 9 will also reportedly receive upgraded cameras, according to Bloomberg.
