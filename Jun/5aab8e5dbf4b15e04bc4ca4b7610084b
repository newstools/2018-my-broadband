Afrihost has informed its subscribers that the Rain networks team is investigating an issue affecting upload speeds on its fixed wireless network. This network notice, which was posted late on Friday afternoon, follows an article by MyBroadband about upload speed problems on the Rain network. Over the last few days numerous consumers informed MyBroadband that they are experiencing slow upload speeds on the Rain network. MyBroadband’s network testing confirmed that Rain experienced a significant drop in its average upload speed over the last week. In response to questions regarding the slow upload speeds, Rain CEO Willem Roos that the company will have to investigate the issue in more detail. He added that the slow upload speeds could be a result of subscribers being on a cell edge, or in an indoor area where their coverage is “not great yet”. However, many of the subscribers experiencing slow speeds are using Rain’s fixed LTE-A network and have used the service in the same location for months. The graph below shows Rain’s average upload speed (in kbps) over the last week, based on MyBroadband mobile speed tests across the country.
