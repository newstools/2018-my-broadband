Cloudflare and ALS Scan have settled a lawsuit in which ALS alleged that the network services provider was helping pirate sites stay online, which is hurting its business. Cloudflare offers denial of service protection and content delivery network services that are used by many websites around the world. The Pirate Bay is among Cloudflare’s best-known customers. ALS Scan also named several other companies in its court filing, including Imgchili.net, Slimpics.com, Bestofsexpics.com, Stooorage.com, and other CloudFlare customers that ALS alleged host copyright infringing material which it owns. TorrentFreak reported that during the legal battle which ensued, Cloudflare managed to get several counts of ALS Scan’s complaint dismissed, but the charge of contributory copyright infringement remained. Rather than go to trial and have a jury decide, the two companies have settled the matter. “ALS Scan, Inc. and Cloudflare, Inc. hereby stipulate to dismissal without prejudice of the claims and action against Cloudflare, Inc., with each side bearing its own attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses,” they said. The terms of the deal have not been made public, TorrentFreak reported.
