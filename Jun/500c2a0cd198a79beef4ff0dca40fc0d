Parliament’s Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests recently published the Register of Members’ Interests for 2017. The committee said the register is published to ensure transparency and to instil public trust and confidence in parliament. The register lists the interest of members of parliament (MPs), and the gifts which they received over the past year. Telecoms companies are prominent sponsors of local events and provided MPs with tickets to these events. A few high-profile MPs also received gifts, which include smartphones, from these companies. The table below shows the gifts, hospitality, and benefits which MPs received from local mobile operators.
