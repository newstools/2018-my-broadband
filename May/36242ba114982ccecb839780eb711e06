Google has launched Smart Compose for Gmail at its Google I/O event in California. Smart Compose lets Gmail users put together emails faster, thanks to its artificial intelligence system which composes suggested sentences in your email as you type. “From your greeting to your closing, and common phrases in between, Smart Compose suggests complete sentences in your emails so that you can draft them with ease,” said Google. “Because it operates in the background, you can write an email like you normally would, and Smart Compose will offer suggestions as you type. When you see a suggestion that you like, click the tab button to use it.” Google said Smart Compose saves users time by “cutting back on repetitive writing”. It also reduces the chance of spelling and grammatical errors in your mail. “It can even suggest relevant contextual phrases. For example, if it’s Friday it may suggest Have a great weekend! as a closing phrase,” stated the company. Google said Smart Compose will roll out in the coming weeks to Gmail users, and will be made available for G Suite customers in the coming months. “To get started, make sure you’ve enabled the new Gmail by going to Settings > Try the new Gmail.” Users must then access the General tab in the settings menu, and scroll down and enable “experimental access”. “If you want to switch back, you can always uncheck the box,” said Google.
