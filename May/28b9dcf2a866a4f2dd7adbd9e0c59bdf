MyBroadband recently added new functionality to its speed test platform, which makes it possible for consumers to rate their ISP in addition to testing their broadband speed. MyBroadband’s HTML5 speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure a neutral testing environment. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to the MyBroadband Speed Test platform. The speed test servers were recently upgraded to support the 10Gbps speeds. To encourage users to test their broadband speed and rate their ISP, MyBroadband is giving away cash and other cool prizes worth R3,000. To stand a chance to win one of these great prizes, here is what you should do: The giveaway will run until 4 June 2018, and the winners will be announced shortly afterwards.
