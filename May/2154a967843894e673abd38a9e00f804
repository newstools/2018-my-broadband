The Customs and Excise Department in Hong Kong has seized hundreds of “fully loaded” Kodi boxes and arrested eight people as part of Operation Trojan Horse, TorrentFreak reported. According to the report, 354 boxes suspected of enabling copyright infringement were seized – with an estimated market value of R517,000. Officers arrested seven men and one woman, aged between 18 and 45. Four were shop owners, while the other four were salespeople. If found guilty of the charges against them, the suspects may face stiff fines and imprisonment of up to four years. The raid in Hong Kong follows a similar case in the UK where a couple was found guilty of charges relating to copyright infringement and running a fraudulent business.
