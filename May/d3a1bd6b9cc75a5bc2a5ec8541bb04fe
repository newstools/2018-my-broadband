Cell C and MTN have signed a new roaming agreement, the companies announced. Cell C CEO Jose Dos Santos said the “far-reaching roaming agreement” will complement their high-quality network. “Cell C completed a comprehensive assessment of the wholesale offerings available in the market and based on MTN’s significant network investment in recent times, we concluded that MTN offered the best solution for our business going forward,” said Dos Santos. The agreement will see MTN provide 3G and 4G services to Cell C in areas where Cell C has chosen to purchase coverage, rather than build its own network. “Cell C will roam on MTN’s network in the country’s smaller cities and rural areas where MTN currently has additional capacity. Both MTN and Cell C will maintain their own networks in the larger cities,” said Godfrey Motsa, MTN SA CEO. “Our customers in those areas will benefit significantly,” said Dos Santos. The rollout of the multi-billion-rand roaming agreement will begin soon, and MTN said the deal will be completed in the next two months. Cell C added that the deal includes a seamless handover for customers, which means when a customer is on a call that switches from a Cell C tower to an MTN tower, the call will not be dropped. With the implementation of the deal, Cell C’s 4G population coverage will increase from 33% to 80%, via the MTN network.
