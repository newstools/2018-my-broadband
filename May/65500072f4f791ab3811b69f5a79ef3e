While Tesla has delivered Model 3 vehicles to customers outside the United States, the company will not be ready for its international rollout later this year. Elon Musk announced on Twitter that left-hand drive Model 3 vehicles are now expected to ship to Europe and Asia in the first half of 2019. Right-hand drive models for these regions are expected to roll out in the middle of 2019. Musk said the Model 3 has been designed to easily manufacture in either left or right-hand drive configurations, due to the vehicleâ€™s symmetry. This follows a recent announcement by Tesla that it expects to deliver its upcoming Model Y electric vehicle in 2020, after revealing the location of its new factory by the end of 2018.
