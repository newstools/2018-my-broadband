Blue Origin has successfully executed New Shepard Mission 8, launching and landing one of its rockets in Texas this week. Amazon and Blue Origin boss Jeff Bezos posted video highlights of the launch to Twitter. Bezos aims to transport humans aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard rockets, and the recent test is a step toward achieving this goal. Mashable reported that the rocket achieved a maximum altitude of 107km, and the crew capsule floated back down to Earth using parachutes. The mission – from liftoff to touchdown – took around 10 minutes.
