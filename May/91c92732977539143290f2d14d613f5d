Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has outlined the plan for his Blue Origin private space venture in an interview with GeekWire. Bezos said he plans to form partnerships with NASA and the European Space Agency to build a permanent settlement on the moon. The first step in realising this plan is for Blue Origin to dramatically reduce the cost of sending payloads into orbit, primarily through reusable rockets. Bezos envisions that humans will eventually work in space, when the cost of moving heavy industry off the planet and powering it using solar power makes it an attractive option. This would free up Earth for residential and light industrial use. “The Earth is not a very good place to do heavy industry. It’s convenient for us right now,” said Bezos. “But in the not-too-distant future – I’m talking decades, maybe 100 years – it’ll start to be easier to do a lot of the things that we currently do on Earth in space, because we’ll have so much energy.” Blue Origin plans to build a moon lander in partnership with NASA in an effort to lay the foundations for a permanent lunar settlement.
