Cell C has launched a new promotion for Black, which sees users given unlimited data usage on the streaming platform. The company stated that the promotion will run over the next three months, and applies to Cell C customers. “Cell C customers can stream the latest series, movies, and more. No data usage with maximum entertainment,” said Cell C. The promotion, which starts on 7 May, is open to new and existing Black subscribers who are on the Cell C network. There are no opt-in requirements, and users only have to download the GETblack app or log in to the black.co.za website to take advantage of the free data. “There is no fair usage policy in place, however, we reserve the right to implement one, should we detect abuse,” said Cell C. Browsing the Black platform has also been zero rated, but usage on the betting platform and the ticketing service will be charged according to the customer’s data plan. National data roaming is also not included in the promotion.
