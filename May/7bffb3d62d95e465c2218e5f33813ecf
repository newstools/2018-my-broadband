Second-hand smartphones are a big market in South Africa, with many new and used phones available for sale across local classifieds websites. Selling a smartphone can be a great way to get some quick cash, especially if you are selling a new device you received as an upgrade but do not need. Two of the biggest online marketplaces for second-hand products in South Africa are Gumtree and OLX. These websites allow users to post images and a description of their product in an effort to sell it. To determine how much users can make from selling a second-hand smartphone, we spoke to OLX and Gumtree about the average selling price for popular devices. To determine the average selling price of second-hand smartphones, MyBroadband asked OLX and Gumtree for details on Huawei P10, Samsung Galaxy S8, Samsung Galaxy S7, iPhone 8, and iPhone 7 listings. OLX provided approximate retail pricing for the products, which can vary according to specifications and design. The classifieds site added that across all devices, the average price of all mobile phones sold on its platform is R3,315. This figure includes feature phone sales. The average second-hand prices of popular smartphones across OLX and Gumtree are listed below. Older-generation flagship devices are the most affordable, with newer iPhone devices still relatively expensive. Huawei’s previous-generation flagship is around the same price as a two-generation-old Samsung Galaxy S7, making it a good value proposition. “OLX users who purchase cellphones on the platform generally save between 35%-55% on second-hand cellphones,” said OLX South Africa head of marketing Karla Levick. “Sometimes the phones people sell are brand new, due to receiving an upgrade they don’t necessarily need, so it’s a win-win for everyone involved,” she said. OLX stated that there are over 20,000 phones listed every month across South Africa, with great deals available for buyers.
