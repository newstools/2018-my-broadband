Microsoft has launched its latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Build, bringing changes to the operating systemâ€™s screenshot system. Windows Screen Sketch is now a standalone application and is no longer part of the Windows Ink workspace. Screen Sketch can be accessed through a shortcut (Windows Key + Shift + S) and works as a snipping tool, allowing users to select an area of the screen to capture. Users also have the option to enable Screen Sketch by default when pressing the Print Screen button. This option is accessible under Keyboard Settings. The update also improves Windows Security and Focus Assist for gaming, enabling the latter whenever a fullscreen game is opened. The latest Insider build is available to Windows Insiders in the Fast Ring and users who opted into the Skip Ahead programme.
