Etv and eNCA owner eMedia has announced it will launch a second television news channel, eNCA reported. The channel will be named OpenNews and will be broadcast on the OpenView platform. eMedia CEO André van der Veen said the OpenNews channel will launch near the end of 2018 and will be distinctively different from eNCA. “OpenNews will be offering viewers an integrated news channel combining short-format news, on-screen information, and links with selected social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, and a proprietary app,” said van der Veen. The OpenNews line-up will reportedly include syndicated content from eMedia, such as The Spotlight, The Tim Modise Network, and The Fix. eMedia will also launch a two-hour block of Afrikaans programming on eExtra, which is available on OpenView channel 105 and DStv channel 195.
