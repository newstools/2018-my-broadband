A Welsh court has sentenced two people to jail for selling over 1,000 “fully loaded” Kodi boxes over two years, TorrentFreak reported. Michael Jarman and Natalie Forber, who were a couple before their arrest, pleaded guilty to running the business which earned £105,000 between February 2013 and January 2015. Forber initially claimed innocence, but changed her plea and said she was forced into the business by Jarman. The prosecution rejected this claim. Her lawyer asked the court for the minimum applicable sentence for the mother of two with no previous convictions. The judge sentenced Jarman to 21 months and Forber to 16 months – suspended for two years. Forber must also carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. According to the judge, the pair’s offences were a “relatively sophisticated fraud” carried out over a significant period. Jarman and Forber also face possible fines through a Proceeds of Crime investigation, should any assets be recoverable.
