Amazon’s Alexa can now be set as a default voice assistant on Android smartphones. Users on Reddit discovered the feature on 7 May, pointing out that the option was available on a Google Pixel 2 smartphone. Other smartphones which reportedly support the functionality include the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S9, OnePlus 5, and Essential Phone. Previously, only Microsoft’s Cortana assistant was available as a default virtual assistant option in Android. Alexa’s functionality remains relatively limited as a default assistant, and cannot be summoned using a wake word like its Google counterpart.
