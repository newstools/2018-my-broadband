Facebook has announced it will launch a new privacy control called “Clear History”. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the new feature is under development. He likened the function to the ability to clear your cookies and history in your web browser. “Once we roll out this update, you’ll be able to see information about the apps and websites you’ve interacted with, and you’ll be able to clear this information from your account,” he said. “You’ll even be able to turn off having this information stored with your account.” He warned that when you clear the cookies in your browser, however, it can make the user experience worse. “You may have to sign back in to every website, and you may have to reconfigure things. The same will be true here. Your Facebook won’t be as good while it relearns your preferences,” said Zuckerberg. Clear History is an example of the kind of control its users should have, and something privacy advocates have been asking for, he said. “We’re working to make sure these controls are clear, and we will have more to come soon.”
