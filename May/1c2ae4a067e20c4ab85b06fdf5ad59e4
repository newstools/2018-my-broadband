Panasonic has revealed its Lumix FT7 rugged compact camera. The camera features a 20.4MP CMOS sensor, electronic viewfinder, and F3.3-5.9 lens. Its standout features, however, are its robust attributes – it is waterproof up to 31 metres, freezeproof, and shockproof when dropped from over 2 metres. Panasonic said the device also offers 4K video recoding at 24p, 1080p at 60p, and 120fps when shooting in 720p. This is powered by a 3.6v lithium-ion 1,250mAh battery, which can be charged via USB. The Lumix FT7 is set to sell for $450 later this year in the US. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
