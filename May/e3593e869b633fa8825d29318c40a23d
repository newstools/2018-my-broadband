Ted Dabney, the cofounder of Atari, has passed away after he was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in 2017, Eurogamer reported. Born in San Francisco on 15 May 1937, Dabney cofounded Atari with Nolan Bushnell in 1972 after developing the Computer Space arcade game with him at Syzygy in 1971. Together with developer Al Alcorn, they built on Computer Space to create Pong, Atari’s early hit. Citing friends, the report stated that Dabney declined treatment for the oesophageal cancer in 2017 after he was told he had eight months to live.
