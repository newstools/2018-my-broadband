Ride-hailing company Lyft announced it is investing $100 million in a network of new driver hubs in the United States, TechCrunch reported. The hubs are locations which give drivers access to cheaper oil changes, car maintenance, car washes, and more. The company said it would also double its operating hours at the 15 driver hubs it currently maintains in the United States. Lyft plans to construct 30 new driver hubs which will each feature vehicle services along with rental and tax filing information, and a coffee shop with refreshments. The company said it is focussed on continuing to support its drivers. “Just as advancements in aviation technologies haven’t reduced the need for pilots or flight staff, there’s still security in the future for the 1.4 million people who depend on driving for an income,” said Lyft.
