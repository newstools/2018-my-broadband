Vodacom will abide by ICASA’s new regulations, which require operators to allow subscribers to roll over unused data or transfer it to another user on the same network. Additionally, the new regulations will not allow operators to charge out-of-bundle tariffs without first obtaining consent from subscribers. Mobile networks in South Africa will be required to send bundle depletion notices to customers at 50%, 80%, and 100% depletion, and require an opt-in from subscribers. These regulatory changes will take effect on 8 June 2018. To see how Vodacom will deal with the requirements, MyBroadband spoke to Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub about their plan to implement these changes. Joosub told MyBroadband that Vodacom is hard at work to implement the changes required by the deadline of 8 June. “We are working hard to be technically ready to meet the deadline as best possible,” he said. According to the regulations, the data rollover system must roll over data, not letting it expire, but the specific length of time the rolled-over data is valid for is not specified. Joosub said Vodacom is in the process of defining its system, but added that the rollover period would be long enough for the data to be consumed. “We are currently still defining these details, but it would be an ample amount of time to allow the customer to use all the rollover data,” said Joosub. Another requirement ICASA outlined is the ability to transfer data between numbers on the same network. It is currently unclear how this system will be implemented and whether it will be accessible through a USSD menu or the Vodacom app, but Joosub said the company is working to build the features into their network. “We are working through all the technical implications of the changes required and finding the best possible way to implement them on our network,” he said.
