Russia’s telecoms regulator Roskomnadzor has blocked at least 50 VPN and anonymisation services as part of its Telegram ban, TorrentFreak reported. This follows attempts by the regulator to prevent Telegram from operating in the country by blocking Internet Protocol addresses belonging to Amazon and Google. It has also suggested that more blockades are in the works, and it is believed Viber could be next in the firing line. Telegram was banned after it refused to comply with new Russian laws that require it to hand over encryption keys to enable the government to decode user messages on the platform. Google stated that certain services are affected in Russia as a result of the regulator’s IP bans. “We are aware of reports that some users in Russia are unable to access some Google products, and are investigating those reports,” said Google. Retail and other business services using Google and Amazon cloud services were also reportedly affected by blockades. Users in the country continue to use the messaging service, however.
