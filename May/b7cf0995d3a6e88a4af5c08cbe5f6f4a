US tech publication The Verge has reviewed the Huawei MateBook X Pro, calling it the “best laptop right now”. “Simply put, if you are looking to purchase a new laptop for productivity or entertainment, the MateBook X Pro should be at the very top of your list,” stated The Verge’s Dan Seifert. The publication said the MateBook X Pro, despite coming from a company which is a relative unknown in high-performance laptops in the US, is a solid product. Standout features included: The Verge added that the battery life of the laptop was “average”, however, and there was occasional fan noise. Huawei previously told MyBroadband the laptop will arrive in South Africa towards the middle of 2018.
