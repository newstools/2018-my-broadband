Facebook’s Oculus has launched its Go VR headset, available for $199 in the US. For this price, you can purchase the 32GB storage version of the device. The 64GB version retails for $249. The Go is a self-contained, wireless unit which you can use without a PC or smartphone. It features a 538ppi (2,560 x 1,440) fast-switch LCD display, which the company said offers excellent visuals. “Built-in spatial audio and an integrated microphone allow for maximum immersion straight out of the box, while headset weight, support straps, and the facial interface have all been optimised for the best fit and feel possible,” said Oculus. The device also features compatible VirtuClear prescription lenses, which can be used with the Go for those who do not want to wear glasses while using the device. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
