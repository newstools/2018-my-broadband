The GNOME Foundation has revealed an anonymous donor pledged $1 million to the project over the next two years, a portion of which will be matched funds. GNOME is a desktop environment for Linux, with the non-profit GNOME Foundation supporting it. “The GNOME Foundation is grateful for this donation and plans on using these funds to increase staff to streamline operations and to grow its support of the GNOME Project and the surrounding ecosystem,” it said. It stated that while the GNOME Foundation has maintained its position as a proponent of the GNOME Project, growth has been limited. Executive director of the GNOME Foundation Neil McGovern said the donation will enable them to tackle key challenges that the free software community faces. McGovern added that as an element of the donation is matched funds, the foundation will continue to fundraise for events and projects, and hope that the generosity of all its donors continues. Details about the donation and the areas of investment will be announced in the coming weeks.
