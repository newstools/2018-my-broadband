Telkom has implemented a change to its Internet APN which will provide mobile customers with a more secure mobile Internet connection. Many Telkom mobile subscribers have noticed that their IP addresses change regularly, and that they do not receive public IP addresses like they did before. The change, one user pointed out, was that Telkom was switching to the carrier-grade NAT (CGN) address space 100.64.0.0/10. As part of the Telkom Internet APN changes, incoming connections and hosted services were blocked by default. MyBroadband asked Telkom about the changes, and the company confirmed it has changed its Internet APN. “The Internet APN allows Telkom mobile customers to access the Internet, but will block all incoming connections and hosted services,” said a Telkom spokesperson. The incoming services which are now blocked by default include web streaming, remote desktop, remote CCTV, and Dynamic DNS on an Internet connection. Telkom said its decision to block incoming services was to prevent its mobile subscribers from receiving unsolicited data. Subscribers who would like to receive incoming connections can use the company’s unrestricted APN, it added. Telkom pointed out that customers who choose an unrestricted APN should be aware of the associated risks. “It must be noted that customers choosing not to utilise the automatic default Internet APN may be more susceptible to Internet security risks and will be responsible for their own security measures,” said the Telkom spokesperson. Telkom said its service operations centre on 081 180 can provide assistance on changing device APN settings. Hat tip to Morkhans, sajunky, rico123, and Maik for the story.
