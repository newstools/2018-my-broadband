Opera has discontinued its VPN app for iOS and Android, and is offering Opera Gold subscribers a 1-year subscription to SurfEasy Ultra VPN. SurfEasy is the company Opera uses in its desktop browser, after Opera acquired SurfEasy in 2015. “This is a free upgrade for Opera Gold users, as SurfEasy Ultra offers unlimited usage on up to five devices, access to 28 regions, and a strict no-log policy,” said Opera. “SurfEasy is also available on more platforms, currently supporting Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and Amazon devices.” If you are not on the Opera Gold plan, you will be able to redeem an 80% discount on SurfEasy Total VPN through the latest version of the Opera VPN iOS and Android apps.
