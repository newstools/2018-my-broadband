The only connectivity better than a fibre link, is two fibre links. Thankfully, when choosing DrayTek’s new Vigor2926 Series, both fibre links can be managed by one versatile security router. Featuring 2 Ethernet WAN ports for high-speed connectivity to fibre CPEs, the versatile Vigor2926 Series is a perfect router and firewall solution for small businesses and large homes alike. Offering up to 50 simultaneous VPN tunnels, 4 gigabit LAN ports and 2 USB ports for mobile broadband fail-over and load-balancing, the robust Vigor2926 Series is the solution for everyone – not to forget its embedded SPI firewall with optional web content filtering and VLAN support for added security. Super-fast WiFi is also an option with the Vigor2926ac models’ 802.11ac Wave 2 radio. Most importantly, DrayTek’s focus on centralized management is brought to the fore, with the Vigor2926 series featuring central WiFi AP management for up to 20 WiFi access points, along with Ethernet switch management and integration with the feature-rich VigorACS2 centralized network management platform to manage all of your or your customers’ DrayTek devices with batch scheduled firmware updates, proactive alerts and real-time network statistics, to name a few.
