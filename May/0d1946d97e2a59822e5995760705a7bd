Bitcoin fell to the lowest level in a month, as a two-week selloff dropped the cryptocurrency’s price below $8,000 for the first time since mid-April. Bitcoin slumped 3 percent to $7,868.71 as of 8:10 a.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg composite pricing. It’s now down almost 20 percent since a May 4 peak. Wednesday’s decline came after OKEx, the most active fee-charging exchange over the past day, suspended withdrawals and fiat trading to fix an error that was leading to inaccurate account balances, according to a statement on its website. The latest hiccup come as the world’s most valuable digital coin is mired in a slump amid growing regulatory scrutiny even after last week’s Consensus confab put the community’s optimism and excess in full display. The declines on Wednesday also coincided with a selloff in financial markets, with stocks and commodities falling on fading optimism over the U.S.’s talks with North Korea and China. Ethereum was also down 5 percent on Wednesday, while Bitcoin Cash fell 9 percent.
