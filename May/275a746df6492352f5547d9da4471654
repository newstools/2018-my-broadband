Google recently released Chrome 66, which allow users to customise when media may autoplay, based on a range of user-defined options. In Chrome, a significant number of autoplays are already paused, muted, or have their tab closed within six seconds by users who don’t want them to play. The company is now improving its autoplay blocking by learning the preferences of a user, based on their browsing history. By default – when a user does not have a browsing history – Chrome allows autoplay for over 1,000 sites where it sees the highest percentage of visitors play media with sound. This will start to change when a user browses the web and Chrome learns their preferences. “This way, Chrome gives you a personalised, predictable browsing experience,” said Google. “As you teach Chrome, you may find that you need to click play every now and then, but overall the new policy blocks about half of unwanted autoplays.”
