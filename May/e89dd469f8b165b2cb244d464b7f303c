MTN has made it compulsory for all WASPS which operate on its network to subscribe to an industry-approved anti-fraud software solution. MTN executive Jacqui O’Sullivan told MyBroadband the reason for the requirement is that the mobile industry has been hit by malware and “click-jacking” attacks. “These are tactics that are used by unscrupulous advertising networks to drive up their revenues. More customers than ever are being affected and as a responsible corporate citizen, we felt it necessary to intervene on behalf of our customers,” said MTN. “We are also in the process of taking further measures to protect our customers. These include making changes to our business rules for all third-party services, while also enhancing our current third-party billing interrogation software, which will ensure that our customers are completely protected.” The statement from MTN comes after an industry player showed MyBroadband a letter from MTN SA to its partners. The letter stated that due to fraudulent subscriptions occurring on the network caused by the programmatic media buying activities of partners, all third-party providers which are enabled to offer subscription billing and/or content management services must be contracted to fraud-detection software. The software must be implemented on all banner advertisements published in the market, stated the letter. Approved anti-fraud solutions are either Perimeter X or Block Fraud, stated the MTN document. The deadline for implementation is 31 May 2018, and failure to meet the requirement will result in the disconnection of services from the MTN network.
