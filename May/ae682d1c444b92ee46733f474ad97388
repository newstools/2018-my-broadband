The Teraco-funded NAPAfrica Internet Exchange Point (IXP) now ranks in the top 15 IXPs in the world. Located in Teraco’s vendor-neurtral data centres in Johannesburg and Cape Town, the IXP connects to over 350 ASNs servicing 16 countries. To see the physical infrastructure behind the NAPAfrica IXP, MyBroadband was given a tour of Teraco’s data centre in Isando, Johannesburg. The peering infrastructure is spread out through various data centre rooms to improve redundancy, with the NAPAfrica racks housed in locked blue cages so they can be identified. Certain racks are more populated than others, but all are interconnected and function together to support the 400Gbps peak throughput reached in Johannesburg alone. Images of the NAPAfrica infrastructure, along with Teraco’s power management solutions for its data centre facility, are shown below.
