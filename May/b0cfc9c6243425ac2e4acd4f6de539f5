Calling for lower broadband prices in South Africa is nothing new, with the government and other stakeholders punting the benefits of affordable connectivity services. While mobile data prices and high-speed fibre broadband access remain expensive, the price of ADSL and wireless Internet access have dropped significantly in recent years. In fact, entry-level fixed-broadband prices in South Africa are of the cheapest globally. Point Topic’s Q1 2018 residential broadband tariff report ranks South Africa’s entry-level broadband prices as the 8th most affordable in the world. Point Topic’s scorecard compares the entry-level, median, and average residential broadband tariffs in 81 countries. The data includes fixed-broadband services offered over copper, cable, and fibre networks. To provide an easy way of comparing prices directly, Point Topic has taken the PPP data on entry-level, median, and average broadband tariffs, produced rankings, and then compared the variance. South Africa’s entry-level broadband price ranking improved from number 21 in 2016 to the current 8th position. It is, however, not all good news when it comes to fixed-broadband prices in the country. South Africa ranks close to the bottom when it comes to the average and the median prices of fixed-broadband products. Point Topic’s broadband tariff country scorecard shows this below, with the countries at the top of the chart the countries offering the best median tariffs.
