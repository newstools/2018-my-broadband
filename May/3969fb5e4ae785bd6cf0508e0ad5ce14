Virgin Boss Richard Branson said he is going to astronaut training in preparation for his first space trip in the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo vehicle. Speaking to BBC’s Radio 4 You and Yours programme, Branson said the first space trip is months away – and that he is excited about what is to follow. “I’m going for fitness training, centrifuge and other training, so that my body will hopefully cope well when I go to space,” said Branson. In April, Virgin Galactic announced that its SpaceShipTwo VSS Unity vehicle successfully completed its first supersonic, rocket-powered flight. “After two years of extensive ground and atmospheric testing, the passing of this milestone marks the start of the final portion of Unity’s flight test programme,” said the company. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
