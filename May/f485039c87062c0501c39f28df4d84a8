Tesla has started delivering Model 3 vehicles to customers outside of the United States, Engadget reported. The electric car maker has shipped a Model 3 to a customer from Ontario, Canada, which is the first of the vehicles to be delivered outside the US. The Model 3 shipped to the customer is a rear-wheel drive model with a long-range battery and premium interior. Tesla’s outside-US shipping follows numerous obstacles during the production of its Model 3, and it has periodically paused production to improve its manufacturing process. According to Elon Musk, Tesla’s assembly plant should be able to produce 2,000 Model 3 sedans per week following the resolution of manufacturing issues.
