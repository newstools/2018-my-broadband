Brian Molefe was found to have inflated a tender for 1,064 diesel and electric locomotives by lying to the Transnet board, according to a report in the City Press. The tender was reportedly inflated from R38.6 billion to R54.5 billion and split between four suppliers, one of which was a Gupta-linked company. The City Press published the allegations after it obtained a report compiled by Werksmans in December 2017, which condemns the corruption and reckless spending surrounding the transaction. According to the Werksmans report, Molefe asked the Transnet board to approve the increase in costs due to fluctuations in currency value and variations. However, these factors had already been accommodated for within the initial tender amount of R38.6 billion. Werksmans recommended that Molefe’s conduct be investigated along with that of other Transnet executives, but Transnet opted to appoint another law firm, MNS Attorneys, to investigate the issue further. Following his stint at Transnet, Molefe held the position of Eskom CEO – where he faced allegations of state capture and criminal charges, following multiple reports of bribery and corruption. Molefe then left Eskom, and had a short-lived career as a colonel in the army, where he earned R57,000 per month despite not having military experience.
