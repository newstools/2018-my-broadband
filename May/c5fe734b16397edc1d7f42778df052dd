Update: Mastercard has stated that the collaboration between Masterpass and Zapper in South Africa is not yet live. The system integration is being worked on, and is set to launch in the near future, said the company. Original article Mastercard and Zapper have collaborated to allow Masterpass users to pay for goods at Zapper merchants in South Africa using their smartphones. Masterpass, Mastercard’s digital payment service, will now work at Zapper merchants – while Zapper users can use the app to make payments at Masterpass-enabled merchants. Mastercard said the services will work at the 20,000 Zapper merchants, and 50,000 Masterpass-enabled merchants nationwide. “When shopping, Masterpass users simply scan a Zapper QR code displayed at a point of sale, or online at a wide range of Zapper merchants, to pay for goods and services,” said Mark Elliott, Division President, Mastercard South Africa. Once a QR code is scanned, the payment amount is confirmed by entering the cardholder’s ATM PIN or a one-time PIN sent to their mobile phones. Will Heygate, Zapper South Africa CEO, said the collaboration will benefit all parties involved.
