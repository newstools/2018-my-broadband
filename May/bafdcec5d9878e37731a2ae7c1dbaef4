It also gathers traffic data from sites that have chosen to install the Alexa script on their site and certify their metrics. According to the Alexa rankings, Google is the most popular website in the United States, followed by YouTube and Reddit. Facebook is ranked fourth, with Amazon, Wikipedia, Yahoo, Twitter, Ebay, and Netflix making up the top 10. This is the first time Reddit has overtaken Facebook in the United States.
