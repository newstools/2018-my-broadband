Vumatel has announced that Dietlof Mare will join the company as its new CEO. Niel Schoeman, the current CEO of Vumatel, will step into the role of Executive Chairman. “This provides Schoeman with the capacity required to focus on the pioneering and transformational projects which Vuma has become known for,” said the company. “These projects include closing the digital divide and building smarter, safer cities, all which are critical for South Africa’s future.” Mare has 14 years of telecommunications experience, and previously held CEO positions for Vodafone in the DRC, Tanzania, and Albania. “He has a good understanding of emerging markets and is excited to guide Vumatel through its next phase of growth as the company matures,” said Vumatel. Schoeman said they are thrilled to welcome Mare to the company, as Vumatel looks to “balance growth with operational excellence”. “We are excited to bring Dietlof’s experience into the business to help us achieve these objectives,” said Schoeman. The move by Vumatel comes after rumours that Remgro was in advanced talks to buy the company. The deal would reportedly combine Vumatel with Dark Fibre Africa.
