Telkom’s Mo’Nice offers are available to prepaid and post-paid Telkom Mobile customers, and can be bought via the *123# USSD menu. Telkom’s latest Mo’Nice data deals offer far better value for money than Vodacom, MTN, and Cell C, as illustrated in the table below. It should be noted that the prices below compare personalised Telkom Mo’Nice offers with standard prepaid data bundles from other operators. The bundles also consist of “Telkom data”, and will only work on the Telkom network. It is currently unclear if Telkom will offer these deals to all subscribers in the future.
