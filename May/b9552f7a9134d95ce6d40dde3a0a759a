South Wales Police has announced it achieved 2,000 positive matches using its Identify facial recognition technology in the past nine months. This led to over 450 arrests, and included a six-year prison sentence for robbery. While false positives are expected when using facial recognition systems, the South Wales Police said no individual has been arrested where a false positive alert led to an intervention. The technology used by the police allows officers to upload images of persons of interest and compare them against 500,000 custody images to see if there is a possible match. It is a real-time solution which uses live feeds from cameras based either at fixed locations or cameras secured to the top of a vehicle. “Built in checks and balances into our methodology” are also used to ensure citizens’ privacy is not invaded.
