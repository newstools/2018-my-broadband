MTN chief technology and information officer Giovanni Chiarelli announced that the operator has reached over 80% 4G population coverage in South Africa. Chiarelli revealed the company’s latest coverage figures during a live outdoor 5G trial in partnership with Huawei. MTN’s mobile network has been growing since the beginning of the year, recently passing the mark of 9,000 4G sites in South Africa. The company reported 75% population coverage for its 4G network just a few months ago, showing how quickly it has expanded. Chiarelli said MTN now has 9,212 4G sites across the country, and its 3G coverage has also increased slightly to 97.6%. This follows Vodacom’s announcement that it had reached 80% 4G population coverage in April.
