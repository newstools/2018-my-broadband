Google has removed its unofficial slogan “Don’t be evil” from its code of conduct which it distributes to employees. Google’s “Don’t be evil” motto has been with the company since around 2000. When Google restructured in October 2015, the new holding company Alphabet opted for “Do the right thing” as its motto. “Don’t be evil” remained Google’s motto in its code of conduct, but this has now disappeared. Gizmodo reported that the popular slogan was removed from the code of conduct somewhere between 21 April and 4 May this year. Here is Google’s Code of Conduct on 21 April 2018. “Don’t be evil.” Googlers generally apply those words to how we serve our users. But “Don’t be evil” is much more than that. Yes, it’s about providing our users unbiased access to information, focusing on their needs and giving them the best products and services that we can. But it’s also about doing the right thing more generally – following the law, acting honorably, and treating co-workers with courtesy and respect. Here is Google’s Code of Conduct on 4 May 2018. The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put Google’s values into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct. We set the bar that high for practical as well as aspirational reasons: Our commitment to the highest standards helps us hire great people, build great products, and attract loyal users. Respect for our users, for the opportunity, and for each other are foundational to our success, and are something we need to support every day.
