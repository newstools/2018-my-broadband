Telkom customers who were previously on the 500GB for R50 SmartBroadband Wireless LTE promotion have reported receiving a similar new offer from the operator. This follows Telkom stating it will offer new data bundles to customers, after the conclusion of its 500GB for R50 LTE promotion. The promotion was brought to an end on 5 May 2018. Customers who purchased the 500GB for R50 deal received an SMS from Telkom stating they should “keep an eye out” for new offers, which would be available in the Mo’Nice section accessed via dialling *123#. The new Mo’Nice Night Surfer data bundle now spotted is: Night Surfer data on the Telkom network is available between midnight and 07:00 each day. The offer is not automatically available to all customers, however. A Telkom spokesperson previously told MyBroadband that its Mo’Nice platform provides users with customised offers based on their usage behaviour. “The customised offers range from airtime offers to minutes or data bundles and surprise gifts. Customers who tend to use data during the night may periodically be offered customised Night Surfer bundles on *123#,” said Telkom. Telkom said it would take what it learnt from the 500GB LTE Night Surfer promotion and apply it to new product innovations for consumers.
