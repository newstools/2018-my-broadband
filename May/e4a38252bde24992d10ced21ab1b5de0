Comodo CA, the world’s largest certificate authority, has revoked the security certificates for Sci-Hub, TorrentFreak reported. Sci-Hub is known as “The Pirate Bay of science”, offering a search engine to download research papers which you would usually need to pay to access. The certificates that were revoked are necessary for Transport Layer Security to function between the browser and the Sci-Hub site. According to Comodo CA, it acted upon a court order which compelled it to revoke the certificates. “By policy, Comodo CA obeys court orders and the law to the full extent of its ability,” it said. The American Chemical Society, which publishes academic journals, confirmed that the move was part of a larger injunction it obtained against Sci-Hub.
