Notepad, the basic text editor that comes with Windows, will soon support Unix and classic MacOS line endings, Ars Technica reported. Prior to supporting Unix standards, source code files written on Linux-bases and MacOS systems would have all their text appear on one line in Windows. This is because Windows expects two escape sequences, or special characters, to tell it to make a new line â€“ carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF). On Unix, only LF is used. Classic MacOS used a bare CR. According to the report, the default text editor in Windows will deal with this inconsistency in standards when its next update is released, likely around October. Those who do not wish Notepad to interpret CR and LF characters in this way may change a setting in the Windows registry to switch the app back to its traditional behaviour.
