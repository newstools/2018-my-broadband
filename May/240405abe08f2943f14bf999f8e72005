Facebook did not see the threat of leaking data to organisations like Cambridge Analytica coming, as it was focussed on “the old threat,” TechCrunch reported. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said with respect to nations, states, or election security, people were worried about spam and phishing in 2016. Referring to the hack of Sony’s email systems, Sandberg said they didn’t have many of the problems other companies had at the time. While they were focussed on this “old threat,” Facebook didn’t see the new one – personal data leaks – coming. Sandberg also revealed that Facebook doesn’t know what user data Cambridge Analytica had, Recode reported. Facebook was conducting an audit when the UK government launched its own investigation into the leak. The audit was put on hold and has not started again.
