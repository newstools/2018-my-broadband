MTN has officially launched its new social bundles. The data bundles are available for WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, and can be purchased in different sizes and validity periods. “The bundles give new and existing customers affordable access to some of their favourite social media platforms,” said MTN. Customers can use the social bundle data without impacting their regular in-bundle data, and the social bundles will send notifications confirming bundle purchase, expiry, and depletion notifications. “For as little as R1 per day, moderate users can stay in touch with family and friends via WhatsApp, while more medium and heavy users can opt for social bundles that retail at R5 and R10,” said MTN executive Jacqui O’Sullivan. The social bundles are available on the MyMTN app or via USSD *136*2#, and detailed below.
