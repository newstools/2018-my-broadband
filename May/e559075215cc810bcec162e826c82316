Nvidia has launched a new 3GB version of its GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card, which offers improved performance over the 2GB model. The new GPU is positioned between the GTX 1050 2GB and GTX 1050 Ti 4GB, with a core count of 768 and memory bandwidth of 84GB/s. The GeForce GTX 1050 3GB has a base clock of 1,392MHz, a boost clock of 1,518MHz, and 96-bit memory interface width. While its 3GB of VRAM makes it ideal for PC gamers on a budget, it greatly limits the GPU’s potential as a profitable cryptocurrency mining card. This means the card should not be snapped up by crypto miners as quickly as other GPUs, and will be readily available compared to the GeForce GTX 1060 6GB and AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB. Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1060 3GB will be available from early June, the company told PC World. No price was disclosed.
