Boston Dynamics is preparing to make its SpotMini dog-like robot commercially available, TechCrunch reports. Speaking at a TechCrunch Robotics event at UC Berkeley on 12 May, Boston Dynamics founder Marc Raibert announced that the SpotMini robot is in pre-production and would be available for purchase in 2019. The company added that the first 100 SpotMinis will be built later this year for commercial purposes, with production ramping up towards general availability next year. The dog-like robot was first introduced two years ago, and is the quietest robot the company has ever built. SpotMini is an all-electric robot which functions without hydraulics, and can run for about 90 minutes on a charge. Boston Dynamics did not reveal pricing information for the robot, but said that production costs were decreasing with each protoype iteration.
