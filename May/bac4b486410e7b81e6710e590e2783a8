Samsung announced it is hosting the final meeting of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) working groups to complete the 5G wireless standard. The meeting is being held in Busan, South Korea. The company said it expects about 1,500 standards experts from chipset, handset, and equipment vendors – including Samsung and Qualcomm. It also expects attendees from major mobile operators such as Verizon, AT&T, NTT DoCoMo, KT, and SK Telecom. At the meeting, all working groups which develop 5G wireless technology assemble to confirm the final technologies for 5G commercialisation. This includes 5G technology providing ultra-high speed data and ultra-low latency, and the conformance testing method for 5G terminals. The 3GPP first approved the 5G Non-Standalone standard in December 2017. It uses existing LTE technology as the anchor for connecting to 5G. The 5G phase one standard will be officially approved at the 3GPP plenary during June 2018, which will be held in the United States.
