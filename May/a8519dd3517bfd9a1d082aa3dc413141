Georgia in the US is considering a new law that will allow companies to “hack back” when cyber attacked, Threatpost reported. Opponents have criticised the bill, warning that allowing companies to go on the offensive may encourage a new kind of corporate warfare. The criminalisation of activities like vulnerability research and penetration testing is also a concern. Google and Microsoft are among the law’s opponents, and have asked the governor of Georgia to veto the bill. They argued that the bill will make Georgia a laboratory for offensive cybersecurity practices that have not been authorised in other jurisdictions, which may have unintended consequences. Microsoft and Google warned that the provisions in the bill could lead to abuse and be deployed for anti-competitive purposes.
