CipherWave provides cloud, connectivity, and voice services, and has a national footprint with branches in Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban. Its local network and data centres are fully owned and managed by CipherWave, providing the company with better control and the ability to offer excellent customer service. “CipherCloud gives customers the ability to move away from traditional on-premise services into a locally-hosted cloud, which gives them unlimited compute resources for their business applications,” says Wayne D’sa, CipherWave Managing Director. “This offers customers redundancy and removes the headaches of managing physical hardware and power – along with the other factors that need to be considered when hosting their own physical services. Our cloud gives customers the ability to minimise business risk by removing the threat of on-site server failure, ensuring business continuity.” In the video below, D’sa outlines CipherWave’s National Fibre Network, Hosted Voice, which powers its services and discusses its cloud offering in more depth.  CipherWave’s Midrand data centre is housed inside a category 5 vault – the first of its kind on the continent – and some of the key features include CCTV monitoring, independent dual power feeds, dual standby generators, dual UPSs, biometric iris access control, redundant firewalls, and much more. “CipherCloud is built on the back of our core network infrastructure and located across two data centres,” says Casper van der Walt, CipherWave Technical Manager. “The primary data centre is in Midrand and the secondary data centre is in Isando, with three dark fibres connecting the two sites.” The virtual machines are replicated on an hourly basis to the secondary data centre, and backups to disk are performed daily as well. In the video below, van der Walt provides more technical details around CipherWave’s public cloud services.  This article was published in partnership with CipherWave.
