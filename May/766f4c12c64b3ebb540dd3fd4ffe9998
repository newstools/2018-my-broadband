Facebook announced that it will launch group calling on WhatsApp “in the months ahead”. The company said voice and video calling are popular on WhatsApp, which makes group calling a logical next step. WhatsApp director Mubarik Imam said the platform now has over 450 million unique users per day, who make over 2 billion minutes of calls daily. Imam showed that the new group calling feature will allow four people to join a group call simultaneously. WhatsApp also announced that stickers are coming to the messaging platform, following the example of Facebook Messenger and WeChat. Stickers are similar to emojis, but are often larger and more unique than the usual set of emoticons available by default to users.
