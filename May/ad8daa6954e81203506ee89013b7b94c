Cell C has started rolling out a new logo with a new colour scheme – orange and white. The new logo has been used on the company’s website, media channels, and in TV advertisements, and will continue to be rolled out in the coming months. A Cell C spokesperson told MyBroadband that the move to orange – away from its previous black and white logo – is part of it evolving its brand identity. “Following the recapitalisation transaction, Cell C has started to evolve its strategic focus and its overall image as a brand,” said the company. “The company began the rollout of the new colour last year through its current brand and marketing materials, as well as through the introduction of the colour scheme on its campus.” Cell C said orange is an “unowned and vibrant” colour that will help it stand out from the crowd. “It represents the newly-invigorated Cell C culture and shows the energy that we bring to our products and services.” The logo design itself has also been tweaked, and is now more “crisp and clean”. Cell C has also introduced a new slogan “Connect your way”. Its previous slogan was “The power is in your hands”. The old and new Cell C logos are shown below.
