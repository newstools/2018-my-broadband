The Department of Education recently announced plans to implement a new history curriculum in local schools over seven years, which may reportedly become compulsory. According to a report by the Sunday Times, the new history curriculum could be made compulsory for all Grade 10-12 learners. The report added that certain academics have welcomed the proposed changes to the history subject in South Africa, as they say the current syllabus downplays aspects like slavery and racism. The destruction of ancient African civilisations has also been omitted, they added. The Sunday Times quoted local academics who said current history textbooks glorified “racists” like Charles Darwin, and do not provide enough exposure to people like Nyakane Tsolo, who was at the forefront of the Sharpeville march in 1960. A team has reportedly been appointed by the education department to investigate the possibility of implementing the new requirements, added the report. The news follows reports that the department has announced the withdrawal of the “designated subject” list for high school students, which places learners at risk of not developing the skills required to excel at university.
