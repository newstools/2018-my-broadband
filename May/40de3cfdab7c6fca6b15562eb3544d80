Applications are key to business success, and to ensure long-term success, companies are required to adopt a DevOps approach that promotes rapid feature releases while ensuring application quality. One of the main challenges developers face is time-consuming deployment, due to a lack of tools to manage and orchestrate systems effectively. In a commissioned Forrester study, focused on developers’ priorities, processes, and platforms, it was found that between 30%-50% of a developer’s time is spent coding, while the rest of their time is spent on application releases. Red Hat in collaboration with XebiaLabs helps customers accelerate and orchestrate application releases efficiently to Red Hat Native Cloud through containers and Kubernetes to better enable collaboration between business, IT development, and operations teams. According to Coert Baart, EVP EMEA/Apac and cofounder at XebiaLabs, they wanted to make a maintainable, reputable solution that is easily deployable for faster application release. The XebiaLabs DevOps platform is designed to scale application releases and container deployments, applying the industry’s best release orchestration to complex container scenarios. It allows users to handle multi-container and hybrid deployments – and multiple interdependent release pipelines – with ease. XebiaLabs is solely focused on helping companies around the world accelerate software delivery and improve release quality at enterprise scale. “By creating a configurable Red Hat OpenShift-certified container for our DevOps platform, we make it seamless for our customers to orchestrate and automate their software delivery pipelines and to migrate to a fully containerised world,” said Baart. XL Release, which is part of the market-leading XebiaLabs DevOps Platform, is now certified as a configurable Red Hat OpenShift Docker container. The certification makes it easy to run XebiaLabs in a container on all Red Hat OpenShift platforms, including Online, Dedicated, and Origin. Red Hat OpenShift is powered by proven open source technologies, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, OCI-standard containers, and Kubernetes for orchestration and management. OpenShift automates source code management, container and application builds, deployments, scaling, as well as health management. “Kubernetes operators simplify application development for Kubernetes platforms by abstracting away complexities and coding human operational knowledge into applications, creating services that can function without human intervention,” said Jonathan Davidson, Red Hat Senior Middleware Solutions Architect. Using this platform, developers can focus on writing code and allow OpenShift to build, run, and scale their apps in the cloud. The certified XL Release container for Red Hat Open Shift is available for download from the Red Hat container catalog. For more information, visit the Red Hat website.
