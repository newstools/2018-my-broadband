South African PC retailer Wootware has started selling customisable gaming laptops online. The laptops are branded as Wootware WootBooks and are aimed at hardware enthusiasts or gamers who would like to have more control over their components. The chipset, CPU, and graphics card are not modifiable, but buyers can choose exactly which RAM, hard drive, SSD, and operating system they would like in their machine. Wootware also allows customers to purchase the laptops without RAM, storage, or an OS, if they wish to buy individual components separately. MyBroadband spoke to Wootware founder Rory Magee about the retailer’s customisable laptops to find out more. Magee said Wootware is working in partnership with Clevo, which is the OEM for the WootBook-branded units, to deliver the product. “We wanted the ability to allow full customisation on notebooks, along with high-quality panels, chassis, keyboards, and trackpads,” said Magee. “We also wanted to be able to make sure that we could offer a very high-level of after-sales service and warranty support, without customers having to deal with third-party repair centres.” He said Wootware handles all warranty claims for the devices, delivering faster service than standard repair centres. “It also gives us the ability to offer better warranties.” The RAM and SSDs in the laptops maintain their original manufacturer warranty, and customers who know how to remove the hardware can send individual components to Wootware for replacement in the event of failure. “Given our experiences with various manufacturers locally and their repair agents, we thought that this would be an area where we’d be able to delight customers with an excellent product at a great price, with the best return for repair/replacement warranty service,” said Magee. The Wootware WootBook laptops listed in its online store are detailed below. These devices do not include RAM, HDDs, SSDs, or an operating system.
