The University of Exeter Center for Graphene Science has found a technique to use graphene in the production of concrete, Inhabitat reported. With the help of nano-engineering technology, concrete with graphene incorporated into it is twice as strong and four times as water resistant as existing concretes. The scientists added that their method also drastically reduces the carbon footprint of conventional concrete production methods. “By including graphene, we can reduce the amount of materials required to make concrete by around 50%, leading to a significant reduction of 446 kilograms per tonne of the carbon emissions,” said the researchers.
