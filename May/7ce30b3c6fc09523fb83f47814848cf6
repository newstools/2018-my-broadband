It’s Mother’s Day this weekend, according to my Mac’s calendar. I keep seeing all these Mother’s Day adverts on the websites I visit, with “special deals” on gifts for moms. I don’t think the ads’ tracking software is working properly, however, because most of it is stuff I want with the words “Mother’s Day Gift” pasted over it. If the online ads are anything to go by, my mom wants a PlayStation 4 Pro, Rogue Russian Olympic barbell, and flowers from Net Florist. The last one may sound correct, but I bought flowers for my girlfriend’s birthday the other day – so it may think there’s a good chance I will splash out for Sunday. I’ve always thought the best gift I could give was being happy and healthy, and I need a PlayStation 4 Pro and Rogue Russian Olympic barbell to accomplish that – not flowers.
