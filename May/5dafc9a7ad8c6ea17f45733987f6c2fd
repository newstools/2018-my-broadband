Google announced that it will launch a third-generation tensor processing unit (TPU) with much higher AI performance, VentureBeat has reported. Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the new processing unit at the company’s Google I/O event in Mountain View, California on 8 May 2018. Tensor processing units are chips designed to provide efficient performance for artificial intelligence applications. The chips have been used in Google’s data centres since 2015 to power various AI-based applications. Pichai said the new chips will be eight-times faster than the previous generation and have required Google to implement liquid cooling in its data centres for the first time.
