Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub said the company sees high potential for continued growth in South Africa, speaking at the company’s financial results presentation at Vodacom World in Midrand on 14 May 2018. Joosub said the potential for growth in data revenue in particular remains high. “The opportunity for data growth in South Africa is strong,” said Joosub. Vodacom’s total subscriber base in South Africa now sits at 41.6 million, of which 18.7 million use data bundles. The operator’s 4G customer base is now at 7.3 million. Joosub added that data growth potential is high across its international operations as well. The company has seen a year-on-year data traffic increase of 43.7%, following capital investment in its network throughout the past year. Vodacom said the increase in data usage and revenue has coincided with a 21.6% reduction in the price-per-MB of data and a 10.4% reduction in price-per-minute for voice charges. The average data usage per smart device on the network has increased 18.4% to 784MB, and Joosub said data pricing remains a key focus for them. He added that access to spectrum is crucial if networks are to continue lowering data prices in South Africa, and for improving customer access to online services. ICASA’s latest data regulations would also have an impact on data pricing, but Vodacom plans to offset this with increased product elasticity.
