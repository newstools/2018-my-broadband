Cool Ideas recently announced it will slash pricing for its uncapped home fibre packages that run on Openserve’s infrastructure. The pricing promotion will run from 1 May to 30 September, and is aimed at getting customers to convert from ADSL to fibre by making it more affordable. “We’ve decided to cut our Openserve pricing very aggressively over the next five months to try and get more subscribers on the Openserve network,” said Cool Ideas. The new pricing from Cool Ideas makes the ISP more attractive to consumers, especially considering its promise that its uncapped accounts are truly uncapped – and lines will not be shaped or throttled. To see how Cool Ideas’ new pricing compares to other ISPs, we have ranked its 100Mbps package on Openserve against competing offers. It must be noted that ISPs offer a variety of uncapped packages, which all have different shaping and throttling policies. Not many ISPs offer true unshaped, uncapped access, and you should consult with the ISP about is fair usage policies before taking out a package. Users must also be aware that ISPs may brand their uncapped packages with terms like “Home Uncapped” and “Professional Uncapped”, which have different shaping and throttling rules. The table below details the 100/50Mbps (download/upload) uncapped fibre packages on Openserve on offer from the country’s top ISPs.
