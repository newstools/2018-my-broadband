The latest WhatsApp update allows users to play videos from Instagram or Facebook within WhatsApp when they receive a link to them. With WhatsApp’s picture-in-picture functionality, users can also keep watching the video while they navigate to another chat. The functionality is currently rolling out to WhatsApp iOS users. The latest iOS WhatsApp update also brings improvements to group admin functionality on the chat platform. Group admins can now remove admin rights from other participants by selecting the admin in “Group Info” and tapping “Dismiss As Admin.” Group admins can also choose who can change a group’s subject, icon, and description by going to “Group Info” and tapping “Group Settings.”
