Fortnite developer Epic Games has announced it will provide $100 million towards Fortnite esports tournament prize pools. Epic Games said it will use the money to fund competition prize pools throughout the 2018-2019 season. “We’re getting behind competitive play in a big way, but our approach will be different – we plan to be more inclusive, and focused on the joy of playing and watching the game,” said an Epic Games spokesperson. Fortnite’s official competitive scene will launch this year, although it is unclear exactly how the game modes for professional play will work. The investment in Fortnite’s esports scene far exceeds the investment of other developers into professional tournaments for their games, including the $3.5 million Blizzard is offering through its Overwatch League prize pools.
