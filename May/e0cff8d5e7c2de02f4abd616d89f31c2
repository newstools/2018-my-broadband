Samsung expects to have AI features in all of its devices by 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported. The company said it would reach this goal by building a team of 1,000 AI specialists in the same amount of time. Samsung told The Wall Street Journal that devices like dedicated smart speakers would not be so important if the majority of devices could interact with users in the same way. Six months ago, the company purchased South Korean AI startup Fluenty to help improve its Bixby digital assistant. Samsung is also expected to unveil an overhauled Bixby 2.0 assistant in the second half of 2018, adding new features and improved functionality.
