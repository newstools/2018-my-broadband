Samsung has introduced a new 16MP ISOCELL Slim 3P9 image sensor. The company also unveiled a “Plug and Play” solution, which consists of a “pre-optimised turnkey camera module made up of an ISOCELL image sensor and preferred partner components”. “Samsung’s ISOCELL image sensors take advantage of various technologies to deliver innovative imaging experiences in mobile devices,” said Samsung. The new module is a 1.0μm 16MP image sensor with Tetracell technology. This allows for “bright and vivid pictures in today’s sleekly-designed smartphones”. It added that Tetracell technology merges four neighbouring pixels, and the 3P9 can function as a 2.0μm image sensor for front-facing cameras. “In addition, the sensor significantly stabilises pictures and videos taken while in motion with a gyro-synchroniser that syncs frame exposure time from the sensor with movement data from the device’s gyroscope.”
