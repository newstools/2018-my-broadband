A class action lawsuit has been filed against Apple in California over the butterfly switches it uses in its MacBook keyboards, with claims the company knows they are defective, AppleInsider reported. According to the complaint, the butterfly mechanism Apple launched with the 2015 MacBook is prone to failure. The same switches were introduced to the MacBook Pro range in 2016. It stated that when dust or other particles build up beneath keys, the switch fails in certain cases, forcing owners to take their computer in for repairs. Due to the design of MacBooks, a single broken key means the whole upper casing needs to be replaced, which includes the keyboard and battery. If the device is no longer covered by Apple’s warranty, this can cost thousands of rand. The repair can also leave users without a computer for a week or more. The lawsuit echoes a similar class action complaint launched in California earlier this month over the same issue. Plaintiffs are asking for class certification, restitution, damages, and legal fees. Apple has not acknowledged there is a widespread problem, according to the report, but has recognised customer complaints as it published a support document with fix suggestions.
