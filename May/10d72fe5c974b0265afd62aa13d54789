Google will soon add three new phones to Project Fi – the Moto G6, LG G7 ThinQ, and LG V35 ThinQ. Project Fi is a mobile virtual network operator which aims to offer a simplified product across the infrastructure of multiple cellular carriers. Key features of Google’s network includes mobile data that doesn’t expire and international roaming at no extra cost. Project Fi runs on Sprint, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular, and has roaming agreements in over 170 countries. According to Google, the new devices offer a variety of features and price points, but have large screens, portrait mode-equipped cameras, and expandable storage. Google said the Moto G6 is available for pre-order, and the LG G7 ThinQ and LG V35 ThinQ will come to Project Fi next month.
