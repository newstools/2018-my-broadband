Major automobile manufacturers – including Ford, BMW, and Renault – have backed a project called the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI). The initiative includes major players across the blockchain and automobile industries, including Hyperledger, IBM, and IOTA. MOBI aims to use blockchain technology to “make mobility safer, greener, and more affordable”, beginning with vehicle identity and history tracking. Other possible uses for the technology include autonomous machine payments, congestion fees, and ride-sharing. MOBI board members include Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf and Ethereum cofounder Joseph Lubin.
