MyBroadband recently partnered with Afristay and Samsung to launch South Africaâ€™s largest-ever mobile network testing project. The project will provide a comprehensive look at cellular network quality in South Africa and will include mobile network test results from MyBroadband Speed Test App users. You can become part of this project by conducting mobile speed tests in your area using the MyBroadband Speed Test App. By doing a speed test you stand a chance to win R5,000 in cash and other prizes. To form part of the test group and enter the giveaway, here is what you must do: Please note that mobile data used for speed tests on your mobile network will count towards your monthly usage allowance, and these speed tests can use a lot of data when testing a high-speed network. Good news is that MTN has zero-rated the MyBroadband Speed Test App, which means MTN subscribers will not be charged for the data used when running speed tests. The giveaway winners will be selected and announced on 21 May.
