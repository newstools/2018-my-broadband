Cell C’s Black online streaming service has weighed in on the debate surrounding the threat posed by international streaming services to local pay TV companies. Black Chief Executive Surie Ramasary stated that while it acknowledges Netflix as a competitor, the hype around the international service is exaggerated and it will not prevent media companies from thriving locally. Ramasary said the platform is experiencing good growth, in spite of competition from Netflix, Showmax, and DStv. “Netflix has built up a global brand by offering customers movies that are no longer in the rental pay window,” said Ramasary. “This means content on our platform will actually have movies before they are on Netflix,” she said. Ramasary added that Netflix also does not offer the same level of local content as South African services. Black expects that as more content players enter the market, customers will have increasing choice and will subscribe to more than one service. “Much will depend on how well you treat your customer and look after their needs. Media companies who are poor at this will see a decline in their subscribers.”
