Vodacom Internet of Things managing executive Deon Liebenberg is leaving the company and plans to join a company in Australia. Liebenberg is known for heading up BlackBerry in Africa during its boom, and making BlackBerry smartphones the premier brand in the region. He left BlackBerry to serve as Samsung managing director in 2012, and later headed up Telkom Business Mobile. In February 2013, Liebenberg moved to Vodacom as the CEO of Vodacom Business Africa and served as the Vodacom executive vice president for Africa until March 2016. In April 2016, Liebenberg took the position of managing executive for Internet of Things at Vodacom, which he held until his resignation. Vodacom could not immediately answer questions about Liebenberg’s departure, while Liebenberg said he will discuss the issue at a later stage.
