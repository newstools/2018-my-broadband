Brendan Armstrong’s dream in the nineties to “have a server connected to the Internet” paid off handsomely – it was the reason why he started Afrihost with his best friend Gian Visser. What began as a project in 1997 to register a few domain names and host a handful of websites on their own server grew into the largest independent ISP in South Africa. Although Armstrong started Afrihost when he was still young, it was not his first job. He worked part-time at Megaweb as a support agent in the nineties, where he earned R10 per hour. While tech support is one of the toughest jobs around, Armstrong said he still misses the positive feedback from people whose problems he helped to resolve. Over the years, Afrihost has achieved many milestones, which include launching the country’s cheapest ADSL products in 2009 at R29 per GB. The proudest moment for Armstrong, however, was moving Afrihost onto its own network through a partnership with Echo.  Linux, Windows, or macOS? Mac laptop, Windows desktop.
