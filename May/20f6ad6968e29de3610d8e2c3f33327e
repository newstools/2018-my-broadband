MyBroadband has partnered with Afristay and Samsung to launch South Africa’s largest-ever mobile network testing project. The project will provide a comprehensive look at cellular network quality in South Africa, and include three main components: This project will run over 3 months, cover over 10,000km, and an overview of the results will be published in a series of articles on MyBroadband. MyBroadband has partnered with Samsung, which provided us with Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy S9 was selected as it is currently the best smartphone in the world, with the latest connectivity options and excellent support for local networks. The smartphones, which are mounted on a test bench, run custom MyBroadband Speed Test App software – which tests the mobile networks at regular intervals while driving. MyBroadband’s Speed Test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure a neutral testing environment. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to the MyBroadband Speed Test platform.  To do speed tests across South Africa means the drive testers have to sleep over in various locations – from big cities to small towns. Afristay, which has properties across South Africa and is known for its excellent service (and has no guest booking fees), was a logical choice for MyBroadband. The accommodation portal makes it very easy to organise your stay, from planning where you want to spend the night to booking, arrival, and departure.
