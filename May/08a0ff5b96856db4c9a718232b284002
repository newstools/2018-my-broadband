Vox has partnered with Veeam and cloud services brokerage First for Cloud to launch a cloud-based backup solution for South African companies. The rapid growth of cybercrime makes it critical for businesses to back up their data, said Vox. “This is usually done with the backup information being stored on a server that sits within the same data centre or premises,” said Vox Executive Head for Cloud and Managed Services Craig Freer. “However, if you look at best practice, you need to have multiple copies of a backup, including one that is stored off-site to ensure a higher level of protection against data loss.” Vox’s cloud backup product includes incremental backups, GFS retention policies, and the ability to recover data and track consumption. The product is available for purchase online and is easy for administrators to install and configure, it said. Primary support for the cloud service will be provided by Veeam.
