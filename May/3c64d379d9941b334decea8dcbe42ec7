The Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASA) has ruled that a recent discount promised by online shopping website One Day Only was misleading. One Day Only advertised a Berlinger Haus 6-Piece Knife Set for R259, and listed the regular retail price as R1,700. One consumer felt that the subsequent promised discount of 85% was misleading, as the same knife set was available in other shops for between R450 and R499. The consumer lodged a complaint with the ASA, arguing that One Day Only was tricking people into purchasing their product thinking it was a great special – when it was not. One Day Only responded, stating that the price reflected on its website was sourced from the official supplier of the product, which was R1,695. At the time of the listing, it was also not aware of a lower price in any traditional retail outlets. The ASA looked for the advertised product on the Berlinger Haus website, as advised by One Day Only, and found that the regular price for the knife set was R770 – with a current sale price of R440. The ASA therefore found that One Day Only inflated its retail price, and that its advertising was misleading.
