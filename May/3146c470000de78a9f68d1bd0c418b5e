Telkom Chief Information Officer Len de Villiers is retiring, a Telkom spokesperson told MyBroadband. “Telkom has not yet appointed a new CIO, however, a recruitment process is underway to do so,” said Telkom. Telkom appointed Len de Villiers, a veteran of the banking sector, as CIO in November 2013. De Villiers has almost 30 years of experience in the IT industry, and in 2009 he was voted “the most admired CIO in South Africa”. He began his career in 1978 in IT management positions at BP, Metro Cash and Carry, and Gencor. He joined FNB as GM of IT in 1986, followed by three years as MD of Microdata, and as an executive director at Datakor Holdings. De Villiers was appointed MD of Nedbank’s Group Operations in 2003 and as MD of Nedbank’s Group Technology and Support Services in 2004. During the 15 years he spent with Nedbank, he won several top achiever awards. De Villiers retiring from Telkom follows the recent departure of Telkom’s head of its consumer division, Attila Vitai.
