SuperSport has officially launched its new website, featuring a new design and a focus on video content. “Among the major changes is a seamless experience between platforms, chiefly mobile and desktop, where the user experience will now be similar. There is also a significant shift towards video, where user numbers have exploded in recent years,” said Johan Huyser, product development manager at SuperSport. “We’ve worked hard on making the site more visually appealing, but also more user-friendly. News, previews, and reviews will feature strongly, and big events of the day or major breaking news will be placed in its “billboard” section on the page. “The reshaping of the site has been 10 months in the making and was informed by the requirements of sport fans who want information and video presented in an easy, elegant style,” said Huyser. A new TV guide has also been included on the site. An image of the new website is posted below.
