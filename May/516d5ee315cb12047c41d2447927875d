Tesla has taken its first step towards compliance with the GNU General Public Licence (GPL) by releasing some of its source code. The car maker has opened two GitHub repositories which contain the buildroot material used to build the system image on its Autopilot platform, and the kernel sources for the boards and the Nvidia-based infotainment system in the Model S and Model X. The repositories can be found here: Tesla has not released the source code for the proprietary applications it runs on these system, such as its Autopilot software or Nvidia applications. The Software Freedom Conservancy said it has been working with Tesla since June 2013, and is pleased to see Tesla acting towards GPL compliance.
