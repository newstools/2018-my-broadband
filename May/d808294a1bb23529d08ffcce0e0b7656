Vodacom will soon increase the peak speed of its fibre-to-the-home and fibre-to-the-business products to over 100Mbps. The company will also launch higher-speed fibre products on its 11 partner networks – Vumatel, Openserve, Frogfoot, SA Digital Villages, and others. Vodacom has fibre coverage in all the major provinces, including Gauteng, the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, the Eastern Cape, and the Free State. The company said it continues to roll out fibre in these areas and is also focusing on outlying regions such as Nelspruit, Witbank, and Polokwane. Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub recently stated that the company wants to become a bigger player in the fibre-to-the-home market. As part of this strategy, Vodacom plans to increase its investment in the fixed-line arena – which includes fibre infrastructure. In addition to its Vodacom fibre network, it plans to grow its wholesale network partners. “We plan to launch Vodacom Fibre on at least three additional wholesale networks this year,” said Vodacom.
