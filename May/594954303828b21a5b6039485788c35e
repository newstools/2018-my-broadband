HTC has announced it will unveil its new Android smartphone on 23 May, The Verge reported. This is despite selling the majority of its phone business to Google at the beginning of the year. While the device has not been confirmed, the report stated it will likely be the HTC U12+. According to the report, the tagline for the device is “a phone that is more than the sum of its specs.” Industry leaker Evan Blass reported in March that the HTC U12+ would feature a 6-inch WQHD+ resolution display. He said the device will also pack twin 8MP front-facing cameras, and a dual-camera system on the back – with 16MP and 12MP sensors. The HTC U12+ is expected to run on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 with 6GB of RAM, powered by a 3,420mAh battery. It will have either 64GB or 128GB of internal storage, and support a microSD card.
