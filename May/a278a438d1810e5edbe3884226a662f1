Samsung will not bring the 256GB versions of the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ to South Africa. The company told MyBroadband the models will not be available in the country, following their launch in the US. Samsung launched 128GB and 256GB storage options of the Galaxy S9 and S9+ in the US at the following prices: “The new phones will offer Galaxy users the freedom to capture more images, download more apps, and enjoy more content than previously possible on the Galaxy S9 and S9+,” said the company. In South Africa, many retailers only stock the 64GB model of the Galaxy S9, and the 128GB model of the Galaxy S9+. The announcement may not affect many South African users, however, as the Galaxy S9 and S9+ support a microSD card. The microSD slot on the smartphone can take a card up to 400GB in size, providing ample space for most users. Support for microSD cards by smartphone manufacturers is not ubiquitous, and high-end devices like the iPhone X do not support expandable storage.
