Google has increased its efforts to push back into China and has now brought its ARCore technology to Xiaomi smartphones. The company announced on Twitter that its ARCore applications are now available on Xiaomi Mix 2S smartphones. Google said ARCore applications are accessible through the Xiaomi App Store in China, adding that it plans to add more partners in China in the near future. While many of Google’s services remain blocked in China, ARCore applications can run – as they use onboard processing and do not rely on Google’s cloud servers. “Starting today, #ARCore apps are available on Mix 2S devices from the Xiaomi App Store in China. More partners coming soon,” said Google on Twitter.
