Google’s Duplex voice technology will identify itself as an AI assistant when speaking to humans, CNET reported. Duplex will be used with the Google Assistant to improve the AI’s voice technology, making it sound like a human speaker. The technology will allow Google Assistant to call up humans and book appointments or reservations, a feature which Google showed off during its I/O developer conference. Duplex has caused controversy due to its accurate reproduction of human speech, including its use of lifelike pauses and verbal ticks like “uh” and “um”. Google has now confirmed that the technology will be designed with disclosure built in, and will identify itself when talking to humans. “We understand and value the discussion around Google Duplex – as we’ve said from the beginning, transparency in the technology is important,” said Google. “We are designing this feature with disclosure built in, and we’ll make sure the system is appropriately identified. What we showed at I/O was an early technology demo, and we look forward to incorporating feedback as we develop this into a product.”
