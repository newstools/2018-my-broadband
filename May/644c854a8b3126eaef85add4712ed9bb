Artist Tim Easley was recently commissioned by the record label Albert’s Favourites to create unique artwork for their latest release by Modified Man called Modifications: Set 2. Modified Man creates electronic tracks, combining vintage instruments and live performances. “The idea behind the cover was how the modified men of the future may make artwork out of ancient circuit boards,” said Easley. “For this I created a design with representations of computer chips and wires.” The 50x50cm artwork was sculpted out of plasticine and took around 80 hours to complete. To create the Modifications: Set 2 album cover, Easley photographed the circuit board artwork from different angles. “From this I created the cover and did the design for the rear. The artwork will be used in various other guises for other Modified Man releases in the set.”
