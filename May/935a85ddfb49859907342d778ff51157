Logitech has unveiled the G305 Lightspeed wireless gaming mouse, which features Logitech G’s Lightspeed wireless technology and its High Efficiency Rated Optical (HERO) sensor. The Lightspeed wireless technology promises a gaming experience that’s faster than most wired mice, at a report rate of 1ms. Logitech G’s HERO sensor has 10-times the power efficiency of the previous generation of mice, which results in far better battery life, added the company. “You can get 250 hours of continuous gameplay at a 1ms report rate in performance mode on just one AA battery,” said Logitech. Users who want to extend their battery life can switch to endurance mode, which changes the report rate to 8ms and extends the battery life to nine months on a single AA battery. The HERO sensor also provides responsiveness and accuracy at 400 IPS (inches per second) precision and sensitivity up to 12,000 DPI (dots per inch), with no acceleration or smoothing. The G305 mouse is expected to be available at US retailers in May 2018 for $59.99. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
