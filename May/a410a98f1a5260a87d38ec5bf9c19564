Google has announced that its Lens AI-powered image processing software will be integrated into the camera app on select Android smartphones. The company also revealed three new Lens features at its I/O event in California. Smartphones which will feature Lens integration include devices from LG, Motorola, Xiaomi, Sony Mobile, Nokia, OnePlus, ASUS, and Google. A new smart text selection feature allows users to copy text from images of real documents such as menus or signs and paste it into other applications. Smart text also brings up recommended information depending on the words highlighted in the scanned document. Lens will further include a style match feature, which will allow users to take an image of decor or clothing and be presented with similar styles. The biggest change is that Lens now works in real time and proactively delivers information on objects within your camera frame. It uses both on-chip processing and cloud-based machine learning to perform this function, said Google. Google said its new Lens features would start rolling out over the next few weeks.
