MTN recently released its quarterly update for the period ended 31 March 2018, showing good data revenue growth. The company spoke about its network investments and how they have resulted in improved performance, too. MTN Group CEO Rob Shuter also made a comment about its use of ZTE equipment in its network, after ZTE was banned from purchasing American technology for seven years by the US government. “Following the recent denial order issued by the US Department of Commerce, we are assessing both the impact and contingency planning given our exposure to ZTE in our networks,” said Shuter. The US imposed the ban after ZTE violated the terms of a sanctions settlement, and paid full bonuses to employees who shipped telecommunications equipment to Iran and North Korea. The ban means ZTE cannot purchase components needed for its products, including chips from Qualcomm and Intel. MTN told MyBroadband it uses ZTE products mainly as radio equipment on certain base stations. “Networks that use ZTE equipment include South Africa, Nigeria, and Uganda. Some smaller networks such South Sudan, Republic of Congo Brazzaville, and Republic of Guinea Conakry also use ZTE in locations,” it said. “Currently, we are fully focused on monitoring and managing the situation to ensure that our customers continue to experience the best service.”
