The Competition Commission has recommended to the Competition Tribunal that Cell C’s acquisition of GloCell’s postpaid subscriber base be approved without conditions. Cell C told MyBroadband it is in discussions with GloCell for the acquisition of its postpaid subscribers. The transaction is subject to several conditions and approvals, with the Competition Commission one of them. The Competition Commission found that the proposed transaction is unlikely to substantially prevent or lessen competition in any market. “In addition, the proposed transaction does not raise significant public interest concerns,” it said. Cell C said it cannot provide further details until all conditions are met.
