Carbon dioxide levels in the Earth’s atmosphere have exceeded 410 parts-per-million (ppm) averaged across a month. The measured concentration for April 2018 was the highest concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere in the past 800,000 years, according to Scripps Institute. The result was measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii using the Keeling Curve measurement series. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which traps solar radiation in the atmosphere, and is produced by the burning of fossil fuels. Before the industrial revolution and increased burning of fossil fuels, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere never exceed 300ppm. “We keep burning fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide keeps building up in the air. It’s essentially as simple as that,” said the Scripps Institute.
