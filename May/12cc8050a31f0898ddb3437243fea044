Former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama have entered a multi-year agreement to produce films and series with Netflix. A Netflix spokesperson said in a statement that the Obamas will produce “a diverse mix of content, including the potential for scripted series, unscripted series, docu-series, documentaries, and features”. The content will be produced by Higher Ground Productions, which was established by the Obamas. Netflix said the content produced by Higher Ground Productions will be available to all subscribers, including in South Africa. Obama said he is excited to partner with Netflix. “We hope to cultivate and curate the talented, inspiring, creative voices who are able to promote greater empathy and understanding between peoples,” said Obama. Comments on social media were divided on the announcement, ranging from “I’ll drink to that” and “Take my money”, to “Netflix just lost my business”.
