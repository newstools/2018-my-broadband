StumbleUpon – a website founded in 2001 to help people discover new webpages – will shut down on 30 June 2018. Its content was personalised to the tastes and interests of the user, thanks to peer-sourcing and social-networking. The website showed very strong growth after its launch and was acquired by eBay for $75 million in 2007. In 2009, StumbleUpon was bought back by cofounders Garrett Camp and Geoff Smith, with the help of several investors. The platform launched a mobile application and a redesigned website in 2012, but it started to decline. In early 2014, StumbleUpon confirmed it laid off 30% of its staff – and in August 2015 StumbleUpon was in financial debt. Camp has now announced “we’ve made the decision to focus fully on building Mix and transition StumbleUpon accounts into Mix”. Mix is also a discovery platform, which Camp said incorporates all of the lessons learned from StumbleUpon to take content discovery to the next level. “Creating StumbleUpon has been an amazing experience. It was the first project I worked on back in college in 2002,” he said. “But it’s now time to focus on the future and create the next discovery platform that will uncover hidden gems we would never think to search for.”
