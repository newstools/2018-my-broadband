Amazon has launched its new Marketplace Appstore, which provides a curated selection of third-party apps to professional sellers, CNET reported. The store will start rolling out this week to sellers and will be available in North America through Amazon’s Seller Central hub. Included in the app store are tools to aid professional sellers with pricing, advertising, and inventory management. “Many developers have innovated and created applications that complement our tools and integrate with our service,” said Amazon. “We created the Marketplace Appstore to help businesses more easily discover these applications, streamline their business operations, and ultimately create a better experience for our customers.”
