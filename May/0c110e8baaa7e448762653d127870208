Uber recently promised certain users in South Africa a discount of 50% on three rides, but these discounts did not apply for the full trip value. The Uber message stated: “Keep going with 50% off 3 of your Uber rides from 5 March 2018 until 11 March 2018”. “The discounts are automatically applied to your account, so all you need to do is to request and enjoy your discounted rides until 11 March 2018. T’s and C’s apply”. When one user took up the offer of a 50% discount and made two trips of R401.77 and R434.02, however, he only received a discount of R60 on each ride. The user then lodged a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASA), arguing Uber’s advertising was misleading. He said the R60 discount maximum, as referred to by Uber, was a crucial piece of information that cannot be hidden in the terms and conditions and should have been clearly stated next to the 50% discount advertising. Uber responded, stating it is not a member of the ASA, but as a gesture of goodwill, it will remedy the situation by providing the complainant with a full refund for the two rides. It added that it will clearly reflect any redemption or maximum discounts in the body of its promotional offers in future. The ASA accepted Uber’s undertaking to amend its advertising, which addressed the complainant’s concerns.
