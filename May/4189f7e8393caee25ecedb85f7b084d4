Google Registry has announced that its new .app top-level domain (TLD) is now open for general registration. The TLD is built for app developers and includes added security to help users showcase their applications. “Because .app will be the first TLD with enforced security made available for general registration, it’s helping move the web to an HTTPS-everywhere future in a big way,” said Google. Users can visit the get.app website to choose a registrar partner and claim their domain name. Google said many early adopters have already registered domains for their applications, including grocery delivery app Picnic and travel app Sitata.
