Uber announced it is rolling out a feature which will allow riders to rate drivers in the middle of a ride. The ride-hailing company said it is introducing the ability for riders to rate, compliment, tip, and share feedback during their trip. Previously, riders could only rate their driver after their trip. This could result in users forgetting to rate their driver and having the rate request for their trip appear the next time they order an Uber. “Your positive feedback will be used to recognise top-quality drivers and encourage continued outstanding service through a new programme launching in June,” said Uber. It added that it also uses the feedback provided by users to improve its technology and identify technical problems with navigation and pickups.
