NASA has successfully conducted full-power tests of its portable nuclear reactor, Engadget reports. The Kilopower nuclear reactor could be used as a power supply for powering habitats on planets such as Mars. NASA announced it had started testing the portable reactor at the beginning of 2018, and its fully-powered tests have exceeded researchersâ€™ expectations. The advantage of the portable nuclear reactor is that it does not rely on the Sun for power and can function in extreme conditions. NASA said the Kilopower reactor takes it one step closer to being ready for long-term space exploration.
