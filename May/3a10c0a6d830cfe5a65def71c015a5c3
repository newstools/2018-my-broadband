Twitter’s advanced search functionality makes it possible to see what your timeline would have looked like 10 years ago, if you followed the same people you do today. The feature was highlighted by Andy Baio, former CTO of Kickstarter, who posted a link to the search query on Twitter. TechCrunch reported that looking back in time reveals a different kind of Twitter, with fewer likes and retweets, and more links to services that were once major players in social media like TwitPic and TinyURL. The search parameters of Baio’s query may be adjusted to change the date – Twitter launched on 16 July 2006 – limit the search area to near you, and specify a language. An example of the search is shown below.
