Google has overhauled its consumer storage plans, announcing an upgrade to Google Drive’s paid plans – now called Google One. Google One paid storage products feature lower prices in addition to benefits in other Google products, such as Google Play. The upgraded storage plan options range from 100GB to 30TB, with pricing starting at $1.99 per month for 100GB of storage. Google has also dropped the 1TB package and lowered the price of its 2TB plan from $19.99 per month to $9.99. Storage plans will also be shareable with up to five people using family sharing. Google said it would start upgrading paid Google Drive users to Google One over the next few months, and will continue to offer 15GB of free storage to Drive users.
