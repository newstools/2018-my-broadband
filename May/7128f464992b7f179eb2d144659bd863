The Wi-Fi Alliance has unveiled a new Wi-Fi standard which aims to let users easily create mesh Wi-Fi systems using multiple routers. EasyMesh from the alliance delivers a “standards-based approach” to deploying Wi-Fi networks consisting of multiple routers or access points from different vendors. This “extends uniform Wi-Fi coverage and enhances performance throughout a larger service than is possible with a single access point”, it said. “Wi-Fi EasyMesh allows users and service providers to select interoperable devices across different brands to ensure fast, wide, and reliable Wi-Fi coverage,” said the Wi-Fi Alliance. It said access points will organise themselves and establish high-performance Wi-Fi network connectivity with minimal effort from the user. Wi-Fi EasyMesh access points require support for 802.11n Wi-Fi devices, and support for 802.11ac is optional.
