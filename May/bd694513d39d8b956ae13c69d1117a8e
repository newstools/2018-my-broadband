While mainstream hype around cryptocurrencies is generally concerned with price movements and ICOs, developer interest has been on a steady upward trend. Loom Network, a blockchain development startup which aims to create decentralised applications (dApps) built on Ethereum, is one of the most prolific forces in dApp development. The company has created everything from Solidity coding tutorials combined with Zombie games, to a functional side-chain infrastructure which allows apps to scale while remaining tied to the immutability of Ethereum. The first functional implementation of a dApp built on Loom’s DAppChain is DelegateCall, which was created to showcase the benefits of decentralised applications over traditional web apps. DelegateCall is similar to a message board or Q&A website, except that the karma points or upvotes users earn for answering questions and engaging are real tokens – which can be redeemed on the Ethereum blockchain. DelegateCall works similarly to apps like Steemit, where users are rewarded for posting engaging content with upvotes that can be redeemed for tokens with real value. However, DelegateCall forgoes long blog posts in favour of a Q&A format more similar to Stack Overflow. Most content on the website is currently based around dApp development and blockchain use cases. DelegateCall runs fully on a Loom DAppChain, which is tethered to the Ethereum blockchain via a smart contract. This allows the two blockchains to communicate and transfer tokens across while allowing the DAppChain to run orders of magnitude faster than the Ethereum main network. Loom Network has also built a block explorer for its DelegateCall dApp, which allows users to see the transactions running on the DAppChain. The company said DelegateCall is the first of many demonstrations it is building to showcase the type of dApps which can be built on Loom Network.  Loom Network broke into the spotlight through the development of its CryptoZombies platform, which taught aspiring blockchain developers how to build a game using Ethereum’s programming language Solidity. The programme comprised weekly episodes which introduced new concepts and slowly built up to a clone of the popular CryptoKitties decentralised app. Loom Network focuses quite a lot on decentralised game design and has created its DAppChain to run applications which require faster block verification times than Ethereum can deliver. This could eventually allow for games which are almost real-time to run exclusively as decentralised applications. The company has also released an SDK which will let developers build games and dApps on its DAppChain through a simple interface. Loom Network has been busy since its creation in 2017, releasing three major products within the first six months of its operations – with plans to continue its rapid development pace.
