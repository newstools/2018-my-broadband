Valveâ€™s latest beta client has activated the Bluetooth Low Energy functionality of the Steam Controller. This allows players to use the controller with Android and iOS devices once the upcoming Steam Link app is launched. The controller also features a wireless connection mode paired with a receiver that offers lower latency and a faster connection. When streaming games to Android or iOS devices following the launch of the Steam Link app, users will need to connect to their device using the Bluetooth functionality. Users who opt in to the latest Steam Client Beta can update the firmware for their device after connecting their Steam Controller to their PC.
