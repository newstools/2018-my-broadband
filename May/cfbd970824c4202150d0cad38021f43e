Twitter has announced it will shut down its TV apps on Roku, Android TV, and Xbox One starting from 24 May 2018. “To get the full Twitter experience, visit https://twitter.com on your device or desktop,” the social media platform said. The Twitter apps for these platforms were not popular, as they prevented users from logging in and tweeting, causing the Xbox One version of the app to receive a rating of 1-and-a-half stars out of 5 on the Microsoft Store. Twitter for Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV will continue to be available.
