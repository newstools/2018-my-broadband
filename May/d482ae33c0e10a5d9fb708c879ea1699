Telkom’s LIT Music package offers zero-rated music streaming across a variety of services, including Google Play Music, Apple Music, and Simfy Africa. The service is included for free with Telkom FreeMe 2GB or higher packages, and can be purchased through Telkom’s USSD menu. Telkom has not yet added support for Spotify, however, following its launch in South Africa. MyBroadband asked Telkom whether it planned to support Spotify South Africa in LIT Music, but the operator declined to confirm the move. “Telkom is constantly engaging with content providers to add to our bouquet of content offerings and ultimately to offer a wider variety of music genres,” Telkom told MyBroadband. “Telkom will announce new content providers as and when we secured a partnership with them.”
