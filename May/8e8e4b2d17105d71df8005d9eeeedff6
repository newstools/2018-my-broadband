MTN has published a trading update for the quarter ended 31 March 2018, detailing its mobile subscriber numbers in South Africa. As listed companies, it is a requirement for Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom to release these figures. MTN’s latest results reflect its mobile subscriber numbers based on recently-reviewed subscriber definitions – which only count subscribers who recharge on the network, and not all active MSISDNs. The company implemented its new subscriber definitions in its financial results for the year ended 31 December 2017. MTN’s latest update showed it had 29.8 million mobile subscribers in South Africa, but did not reflect its postpaid and prepaid subscriber share. Vodacom’s trading update for its latest quarter showed it had 41.6 million local subscribers. Telkom’s latest financial results reflected an active mobile subscriber base of 4.4 million. Cell C’s financial results for the year ended 31 December 2017 show it had 16.3 million active subscribers.
