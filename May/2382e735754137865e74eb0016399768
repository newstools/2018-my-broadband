A Tesla sedan in autopilot mode has crashed into a parked police SUV in Laguna Beach, with the Tesla driver suffering minor injuries. Laguna Beach police sergeant Jim Cota said the police officer was not in his vehicle at the time of the collision. According to CBS Los Angeles, the crash was severe enough to push the two passenger-side wheels of the stationary police SUV onto the sidewalk. Earlier this year, the National Transportation Safety Board started investigating an accident involving a Tesla Model S that rear-ended a firetruck on a freeway near Los Angeles. The inquiry was the second by the safety agency involving Tesla’s autopilot feature. The autopilot system combines advanced cruise control and automatic steering systems, but Tesla said the human driver should pay attention to the road at all times.
