HTC is developing a blockchain-powered smartphone named Exodus. The device will run Android and will include built-in support for blockchain applications as well as a universal cryptocurrency wallet. Exodus is being developed by a team lead by Vive creator Phil Chen, who is overseeing the cryptocurrency and blockchain initiatives at HTC. HTC said it will also launch its own blockchain network, with each Exodus smartphone acting as a node and facilitating transactions. “Through Exodus, we are excited to be supporting underlying protocols such as Bitcoin, Lightning Networks, Ethereum, Dfinity, and more,” said Chen. Blockchain-powered smartphones further feature integrated cold wallet storage and trade directly with other wallets without third-party interfaces. HTC did not reveal any pricing information for its Exodus smartphone, but said it will accept payment in cryptocurrency.
