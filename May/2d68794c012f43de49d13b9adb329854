Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the carmaker’s upcoming Model Y electric vehicle will start production in 2020, Electrek reported. Musk said the vehicle will bring “a manufacturing revolution” and confirmed the vehicle will be produced in a new factory. Tesla said it will announce the location of its new factory by the end of 2018. The Model Y will not be manufactured on the same platform as the Model 3, and will be built on a new platform. The platform will reportedly drop the 12-volt battery architecture, reducing overall wiring and making automated production easier.
