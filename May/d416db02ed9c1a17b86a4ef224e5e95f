The South African Post Office’s website is down – again. The website – https://www.postoffice.co.za – was not accessible when navigated to by MyBroadband on laptop and mobile browsers this evening. According to a MyBroadband reader, they have been unable to access the website for several days. Google Chrome delivered the following message when attempting to access the domain. This site can’t be reached. www.postoffice.co.za’s server IP address could not be found. The most recent Google cache of the site was on 18 May 2018, at 14:26 GMT. It appears the downtime extends beyond the website, however, as emails to multiple @postoffice.co.za email addresses bounced when MyBroadband attempted to contact them. This included the email addresses of the “Manager” and IT Support” contacts listed on the domain’s whois registration page, and SA Post Office CEO Mark Barnes. The following mail delivery notification was returned to MyBroadband when mails were sent. A message that you sent could not be delivered to one or more of its recipients. This is a permanent error. The following address(es) failed. [address]@postoffice.co.za

It was discovered that main reason for the downtime in March was the suspension of its domain due to non-payment. There were reportedly several additional errors with the “postoffice.co.za” zone set-up, too.
