Cell C has launched eight new Pinnacle and Pinnacle Premium contracts. The company said the contracts bring “more data without compromising on choice”, and start at R149 per month. “Our new data-centric Pinnacle plans provide customers with exactly what they are looking for,” said Cell C CEO Jose Dos Santos. The new Pinnacle plans also include free streaming data for its Black platform, with contracts starting at a 2GB per day fair-usage limit – going up to 4GB. “That is a potential 124GB of data per month without using your inclusive data to watch your favourite shows,” said Dos Santos. Cell C stated that the contracts also include any-network minutes, SMSs, and standard mobile data allocations. The new products will be available from 1 June 2018 from Cell C stores, Cell C Direct, and the Cell C online store. Cell C’s new Pinnacle contracts are detailed in the table below. Cell C has also introduced TopUp versions of these contracts, which range from Pinnacle 300MB TopUp to the Pinnacle 3GB TopUp. The TopUp contracts are detailed in the table below.
