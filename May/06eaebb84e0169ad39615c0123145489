Vox will launch a 200Mbps uncapped fibre package to Openserve users very soon, the company has told MyBroadband. The 200/100Mbps basic uncapped bundle will retail for R1,999 per month, it said. The new package from Vox follows Openserve upgrading its fibre infrastructure to support download speeds of 200Mbps and upload speeds of 100Mbps. Openserve said allÂ its current fibre users are able to receive 200Mbps speeds, and clients can upgrade through a relevant ISP.
