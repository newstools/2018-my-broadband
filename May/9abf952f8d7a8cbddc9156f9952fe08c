Acer’s Predator X27 G-Sync monitor with HDR support is now available for pre-order from Newegg. The monitor is the first PC display to feature both Nvidia’s G-Sync technology and HDR support, and is priced at $1,999. Nvidia HDR G-Sync monitors promise high variable refresh rates in addition to exceptional contrast ratios and colour quality, all while delivering high brightness and low response times. G-Sync eliminates screen tearing by syncing the refresh rate of the monitor according to the frame rate outputted by the computer’s graphics card. This results in a smoother gameplay experience without any screen tearing or other artefacts. The Acer Predator X27 boasts a Quantum Dot IPS panel with a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160, a 144Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of 1,000 nits. The impressive display also sports full 10-bit colour support and a 4ms response time. It should be noted that G-Sync monitors are generally more expensive than other variable refresh rate solutions, due to the cost of the proprietary Nvidia G-Sync module.
