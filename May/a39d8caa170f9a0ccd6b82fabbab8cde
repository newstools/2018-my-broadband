Telkom said it is offering new Night Surfer data bundles to customers, following the conclusion of its 500GB for R50 LTE promotion. Telkom’s 500GB for R50 SmartBroadband Wireless LTE promotion gave users 500GB of Night Surfer LTE data for R50, valid for 31 days. It was brought to an end on 5 May 2018. Customers who purchased the 500GB for R50 deal received an SMS from Telkom stating they should “keep an eye out” for new offers, however. “Dear customer, a reminder that you only have until the 4 May 2018 to purchase the 500GB night surfer bundle for R50. Telkom Mo’Nice will soon have a night surfer offer available on *123#,” stated the SMS. A Telkom spokesperson told MyBroadband that its Mo’Nice *123# platform provides customers with customised offers based on their usage behaviour. “The customised offers range from airtime offers to minutes or data bundles and surprise gifts. Customers who tend to use data during the night may periodically be offered customised Night Surfer bundles on *123#,” said Telkom. “The details of these offers are competitive in nature,” it added. The company said it will take what it has learnt from the 500GB LTE Night Surfer promotion and apply it to new product innovations for consumers.
