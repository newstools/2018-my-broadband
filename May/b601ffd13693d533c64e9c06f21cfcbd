The Ford Focus and Fiesta are performing well in South Africa, Ford South Africa has told MyBroadband. The statement from the company comes after Ford in the US announced it would end production of the Focus and Fiesta for North America by mid-2019. Ford will stop producing the Focus for North America this month. It will stop Fiesta production in May 2019. According to reports, the reason for the models being dropped is declining consumer demand and product profitability. This was attributed to an increase in ride-sharing services, and apps like Uber, and the increase in popularity of SUVs. In South Africa, however, the Focus and Fiesta continue to do well. Ford South Africa said the announcement in North America will not affect the South African product line-up. “We are launching the new Fiesta in two weeks’ time, and the Focus at the end of the year. Both models continue to do well in our local line-up,” said the company.
