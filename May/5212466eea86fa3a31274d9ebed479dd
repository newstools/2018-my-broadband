Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced that the ride-hailing company would resume testing its self-driving cars in the next few months, The Verge reported. Uber halted its self-driving car tests following a crash in Tempe, Arizona which resulted in the death of a pedestrian. A video of the incident showed the Uber safety driver was distracted moments before the collision and was unable to intervene. Speaking at the Uber Elevate conference in Los Angeles, Khosrowshahi said Uberâ€™s self-driving vehicles should be back on the road after the National Traffic Safety Board releases its report regarding the incident. Uber is also conducting its own internal safety review of the incident.
