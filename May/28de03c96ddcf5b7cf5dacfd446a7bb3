I own a 2017 MacBook Pro 15-inch, and I love it – but if I had to venture back to Windows, the latest ASUS ZenBook Pro 15 would be at the top of the laptop list. ASUS has kitted the ZenBook Pro 15 with the latest high-end Intel 8th-gen Core processor, the Intel Core i9-8950HK. It packs six cores, and the CPU has been paired with 16GB of RAM, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU, and a 1TB SSD. This powers a 4K display, all housed in a sleek full aluminium unibody. This is important, as once you have owned a metal-body laptop, you cannot go back to plastic-bodied devices. Images and specifications of the new ZenBook Pro 15 are posted below. Pricing for the laptop is yet to be announced.
