Acer has unveiled a selection of its laptops that will ship with Amazon Alexa pre-installed, Engadget reported. Alexa support will allow users with smart home devices to control their network of gadgets from their laptop, instead of addressing an Echo smart speaker. Supported laptops include the latest Spin 3 and Spin 5, in addition to the Nitro 5 Spin – which is set to launch next month. Acer’s Switch and Swift lineups will also offer built-in Alexa support to users over the coming weeks. Users with compatible models can receive Alexa support in updates delivered through Acer’s Care Centre, starting from 23 May, added the report.
