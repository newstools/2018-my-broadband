Movie ticket prices have increased at Ster-Kinekor and Nu Metro cinemas around the country. Although increases at Ster-Kinekor were mostly below inflation, certain cinemas saw hikes of 10% or more for 2D shows. Nu Metro ticket prices also received significant hikes for the second year in a row. The prices for its VIP cinemas remain cheaper than Ster-Kinekor Prestige theatres, but for the first time in years, Nu Metro’s standard shows (2D and 3D) are more expensive than those of its competitor. “An annual price increase is normal for most companies operating within the entertainment and service industry sectors,” a Ster-Kinekor spokesperson previously told MyBroadband. Ster-Kinekor’s ticket prices vary by cinema complex, and the figures below show the prices of the most expensive and mid-tier theatres. “Like any business, supply and demand plays a role in how Ster-Kinekor determines which titles are scheduled at which sites, and what the ticket prices are at these sites,” said Ster-Kinekor. “This exercise includes an audience analysis.” 2D and 3D movie prices across its theatres since 2005, plotted against inflation, are shown below.  The Nu Metro graph for 2D ticket prices shows how the brief price war between the two cinema chains affected increases between 2005 and 2007. Ster-Kinekor launched its cheaper Junction cinemas, where you bought a ticket but didn’t book a seat, and Nu Metro dropped its prices across the board to compete. Since then, Ster-Kinekor has stopped using the brand names “Classic” and “Junction”, although signage referring to the cinemas as such can still occasionally be seen outside malls. Like the Ster-Kinekor prices, we plotted Nu Metro’s ticket prices since 2005 against inflation.
