Telkom’s latest Night Surfer special which offers 450GB of LTE data, valid for 30 days, for R59 will not be made publicly available. A Telkom spokesperson made the statement to MyBroadband after we were flooded with queries on how users could access the great deal. The 450GB Night Surfer special was launched on the operator’s Mo’Nice platform recently, accessible via *123#, following the ending of Telkom’s 500GB for R50 SmartBroadband Wireless LTE promotion. The new Mo’Nice Night Surfer data bundle, which can be used between midnight and 07:00 every day, is not automatically available to all customers, however. A Telkom spokesperson previously told MyBroadband that its Mo’Nice platform provides users with customised offers based on their usage behaviour. “The customised offers range from airtime offers to minutes or data bundles and surprise gifts. Customers who tend to use data during the night may periodically be offered customised Night Surfer bundles on *123#,” said Telkom. A Telkom spokesperson has now told MyBroadband there are no plans to make the 450GB Night Surfer special publicly available. “Telkom’s current strategy is to retain this offer as part of Telkom’s customised offering on the Mo’Nice platform,” said Telkom. “Customised offers on the Mo’Nice platform are based on a number of factors, including customer usage behaviour. A customer’s unique usage pattern determines the type of offers made available to them.” The news may be disappointing to many Telkom LTE users, who not only praised the the 500GB for R50 Night Surfer deal, but were keen to get their hands on the 450GB for R59 deal. Telkom also offers smaller data bundles via the Mo’Nice platform, including 1GB of Telkom anytime mobile data, valid for 30 days, for R12.
