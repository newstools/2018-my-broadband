Ster-Kinekor and Nu Metro have increased movie ticket prices. A 3D movie at one of Ster-Kinekor’s top-tier cinemas went from R97 to R98, while Nu Metro’s prices went from R95 to R100. Other than tickets for a Nu Metro 4DX movie, the prices at all other cinemas were adjusted. Prices on 3D movies at Ster-Kinekor’s theatres in Parow and Maponya decreased by 6.9% to R67, but otherwise ticket prices increased across the board. While Ster-Kinekor’s increases peaked at 10.7% for a 2D movie at Sterland, Nu Metro increased its prices by up to 40% in certain cases. An interesting anomaly in Nu Metro’s price adjustments is that it appears Scene VIP prices are the same for 3D and 2D shows – except at Woodlands in Pretoria. Woodlands Nu Metro did increase its prices, but by much less than other cinemas. A 3D Scene VIP ticket at Woodlands is now R125 (up 8.7%), while a 2D Scene VIP ticket is R110 (up 10%). Ster-Kinekor previously told MyBroadband that annual price increases are normal for most companies operating within the entertainment and service industry sectors. South Africa’s inflation rate for 2017 was 5.3%, and most of the price increases at Ster-Kinekor’s cinemas are well below that. It should also be noted that Nu Metro and Ster-Kinekor have loyalty and partner programmes that offer discounts on tickets. The changes to full ticket prices across the cinemas are summarised below.
