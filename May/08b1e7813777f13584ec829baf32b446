Imgur announcedÂ it is evolving from a platform focussed purely on GIFs and images, and is launching video support. All the videos will be muted by default, with users able to unmute them by clicking a sound icon in the corner of their frame. The ability to upload videos to Imgur is currently only available on Imgur for iOS, but will come to other platforms soon. iOS users can upload, trim, and share videos up to 30 seconds long, and choose whether to include sound with their post. Users can also create posts using a mixture of GIFs, images, and video.
