Snapchat has started showing six-second commercials which cannot be skipped on its live network, AdAge reported. The first forced-view ads reportedly began appearing on 14 May 2018, and included commercials for Deadpool 2 and the Samsung Galaxy S9. Snapchat’s six-second un-skippable ad spots are only available in the app’s Shows section, which hosts episodic content from media partners. Additionally, clicking on the adverts does not link to longer videos or other ecommerce experiences. This is the first time the company has implemented ads which cannot be skipped.
