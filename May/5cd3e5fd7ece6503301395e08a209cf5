MyBroadband recently conducted its latest South African broadband survey, which showed that Cool Ideas is the countryâ€™s top-rated Internet service provider. The survey was completed by 7,078 South African broadband subscribers between 9-30 April 2018. The users were typically IT professionals and tech-savvy individuals with a strong knowledge of the local broadband market. The survey participants rated their broadband connection, their fixed-line ISP, and their mobile provider. The results show how happy subscribers are with their ISP or mobile operator, and can therefore be seen as a customer satisfaction ranking. Fibre users were the happiest with their broadband connections, followed by VDSL and LTE users. The ratings appear directly related to the speed of the broadband connections. In the ISP segment, Cool Ideas reigned supreme as the best fixed-line ISP, followed by Axxess and Vox. The top-rated mobile operator was Telkom Mobile, followed by MTN, Vodacom, and Cell C. The tables below provide an overview of the results of the latest South African broadband survey.
