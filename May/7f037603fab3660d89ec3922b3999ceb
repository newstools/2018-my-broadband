Apple has blocked Valve’s Steam Link app from being released on its App Store. Steam Link allows users to stream gameplay from their PC and play on supported devices with minimal latency. SteamDB posted a tweet containing Valve’s press statement concerning the rejection of the app. The Steam Link app was initially approved for iOS release on 7 May, but following the announcement, Apple revoked its approval for the app – citing business conflicts not originally realised by the original review team. Valve then appealed the decision, stating that the app is similar to many remote desktop applications which exist on the App Store. Apple denied the appeal, blocking Valve’s Steam Link app from releasing on iOS. “The team here spent many hours on this project and the approval process, so we’re clearly disappointed,” said Valve.
