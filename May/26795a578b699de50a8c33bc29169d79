Twitter has a “secret conversation” option hidden in the code of its Android app, TechCrunch reported. No details about the launch date and functionality of the feature have been announced, but screenshots of the code in action suggest Twitter is prototyping it. Based on the screenshots, Twitter Secret Conversations will work similarly to Telegram’s, where you must first open a secret conversation with another user before it will be encrypted. The discovery comes a year and a half after NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden suggested on Twitter that the feature be added, and received a response from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Twitter declined to comment about testing Secret Conversations on the platform.
