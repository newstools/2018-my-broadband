The Treasury Secretary of the United States, Steve Mnuchin, said the Justice Department needs to take a look at whether Google is abusing its market dominance, The Register reported. He argued that companies like Google have a big impact on the economy and it is important to look at the power they wield. Mnuchin is among several government officials calling for anti-trust probes into large tech companies. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager recently said they can prove Google was acting illegally to promote its own services and downgrade its competitors. Vestager said her staff used over a billion Google searches as a research sample and found the company was manipulating its algorithms to promote its own products and push competitors down its search rankings. “It’s very difficult to find the rivals, because on average you’d find them only on page four in your search results,” said Vestager.
