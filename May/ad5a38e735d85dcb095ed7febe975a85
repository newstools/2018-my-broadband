An Android smartphone user recently stated that typing “the1975..com” (with two dots) into the Google app caused the device to return a list of recent SMS messages received, CNET reported. The user said they tried to reach the website of the band The 1975 by typing the URL, but accidentally typed two dots instead of one. According to reports, the bug affects Pixel, OnePlus, Samsung, LG, and Huawei devices which run versions of the Google assistant. Other users found that the search query “vizela viagens” caused the same bug to occur. In MyBroadband’s testing, the “1975..com” query returned a list of recent SMS messages, but searching for “vizela viagens” in Google’s launcher returned the details of a travel agency in Portugal.
