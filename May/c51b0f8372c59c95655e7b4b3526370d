Oculus Research has been renamed to Facebook Reality Labs, the division’s chief scientist Michael Abrash announced. “While our name is new, our focus on the future hasn’t changed,” said Abrash. “Facebook Reality Labs brings together a world-class R&D team of researchers, developers, and engineers with the shared goal of developing AR and VR across the spectrum.” Abrash said there are difficult challenges in virtual and augmented reality, all of which are solvable. On the hardware side, this includes panel resolution, pixel density, field of view, and depth of focus. “I can’t think of a better challenge to undertake, and that’s why I personally am doing this. It is pretty clear to me that when we look back in 20 or 30 years, AR and VR will be the technologies that made the future.” <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
