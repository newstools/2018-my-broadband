Reddit has announced it is rolling out a much-requested Night Mode feature. The company said it has collected feedback about its recent redesign, and many users requested a Night Mode for desktop. Reddit said that before it could implement Night Mode on its redesigned website, it had to fix the way its application handled colours. The company’s design team created a smaller colour system and slowly implemented it across the website. After rolling out the Night Mode theme for testing to its employees, Reddit released the option to public users. Users can switch to Night Mode by clicking on their user name in the top-right of the Reddit interface and toggling the option.
