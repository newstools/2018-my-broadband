Boston Dynamics has posted new videos to its YouTube channel showing its Atlas robot running outside, while its four-legged SpotMini is shown walking up stairs. While the first video doesn’t show Atlas doing anything we haven’t seen it do before, it puts together several skills the company previously demonstrated for the robot – walking outside, running, and jumping over an obstacle. In its second video, Boston Dynamic shows SpotMini navigating autonomously, as well as walking up and down stairs. It also provides a view of the robot’s navigation systems, and how it detects nearby objects and paths to walk. The videos from Boston Dynamics are embedded below. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
