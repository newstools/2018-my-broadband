Microsoft has expanded its digital game gifting programme to include PC games and in-game content. The company previously supported digital gifting for selected Xbox One titles, but now covers PC titles, PC downloadable content, and all Xbox One games. To purchase a game as a gift, users navigate to their chosen title in the Microsoft Store on Windows 10, select the “Buy as Gift” option, and enter the email address of the recipient. Xbox One purchasers can also enter the Gamertag of the recipient. Recipients will then receive a product registration code along with instructions on how to redeem the title. Gift purchasers are limited to two discounted products every 14 days, but there are no limits for gift purchases made at full price.
