Kia has announced that its Stinger GT will come to South Africa, and will be available for R859,995. The car aims to take on the high-powered four-door sedans from the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz, and packs impressive performance on paper. Kia’s most powerful and fastest-accelerating production car ever made, the Stinger GT features a 3.3-litre twin-turbocharged V6 engine. This produces 272kW at 6,000rpm, and 510Nm of torque between 1,300-4,500rpm. Its 0-100km/h time clocks in at 4.9 seconds, and it will top out at 270km/h. “The Stinger GT is comprehensively engineered to complement its thoroughbred power plant,” said Kia. It is equipped with a mechanical limited-slip differential, is rear-wheel drive, has an eight-speed-automatic transmission, and a Centrifugal Pendulum Absorber torque converter. “Drivers can let the gearbox manage shifts on its own or may selectively run through the gears via paddle shifters mounted aft of the steering wheel.” Kia said the car comes with an unlimited kilometre, 5-year warranty, and a 5-year/90,000km maintenance plan. Due to the limited number of Stinger GT models available, the vehicle will only be sold locally through www.kiastinger.co.za.
