Facebook has overhauled its Certificate Transparency Monitoring Tool to help developers fight phishing attacks. The tool can alert website owners to malicious domains that are created to implement phishing attacks against visitors. Facebookâ€™s Certificate Transparency tool previously kept a record of valid security certificates issued for domains owned by the company, but it is now being extended to aid other domain owners in combating phishing attacks. The tool analyses each certificate issued and checks it against common spoofing techniques, notifying the owner of the legitimate domain if an attempt at phishing is detected. Developers can enable free phishing domain monitoring through the Facebook developers portal.
