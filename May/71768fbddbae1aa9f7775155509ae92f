Rolls-Royce launched its first-ever SUV at the automaker’s headquarters in Goodwood, England today. Named the Cullinan, the new vehicle boasts a 6.75-litre twin-turbo V12 Rolls-Royce engine which delivers 420kW of power and 850Nm of torque. The four-wheel drive SUV also features an all-wheel steering system, which the automaker says turns it into a capable off-roader. Rolls-Royce built the Cullinan using a three-box design, featuring a glass rear partition wall separating passengers from the luggage compartment. It is the second vehicle to be built on the carmaker’s all-new aluminium architecture. The Cullinan is the carmaker’s first foray into the SUV market, and is expected to turn heads in South Africa. Rolls-Royce named the new SUV after the world-famous 3,106-carat Cullinan diamond, discovered in South Africa on 26 January 1905. The Cullinan is a luxury vehicle which will appeal to a niche market in South Africa, and will have a heavy price tag. According to the GM of Rolls-Royce Sandton, Marek Letowt, four Cullinans will arrive in South Africa in November 2018.
