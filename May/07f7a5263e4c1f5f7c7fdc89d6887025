Microsoft has unveiled the Surface Hub 2, a large-format display aimed at the workplace. “Surface Hub 2 was designed from the ground up to be used by teams,” said Panos Panay, Microsoft Chief Product Officer. “The gorgeous 4K+ 50.5-inch multi-touch display (3×2 aspect ratio) creates an inviting canvas to co-create, harnessing the power of Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Whiteboard, Office 365, Windows 10 and the intelligent cloud.” It also features 4K cameras that rotate with the device, integrated speakers, microphone arrays, and the ability to link multiple displays. “Surface Hub 2 scales and adapts to your space through tiling up to four screens together in portrait or landscape view,” said Panay. Additionally, the display can be moved around thanks to Microsoft’s partnership with Steelcase to create a system of rolling stands. “In 2018, we will begin to test Surface Hub 2 with select commercial customers. It will be available for purchase in 2019,” said Microsoft. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
