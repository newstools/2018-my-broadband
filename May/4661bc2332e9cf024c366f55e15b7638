Facebook has partnered with camera manufacturer RED to develop a professional VR camera system. The 6DoF (six degrees of freedom) camera will record 3D video footage that can be explored in virtual reality. The camera will be able to recored high-quality images with over 16-stops of dynamic range, allowing for improved realism and depth estimation. The images it produces will require a 6DoF VR headset like the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive to be fully experienced, added the company. There is currently no information on an expected launch window for the camera.
