Plex has overhauled its Android and iOS applications, and implemented a number of new features. The company has launched podcast support in beta across its iOS, Android, Roku, and Plex Web platforms. Podcasts are free for all users and do not require a Plex Media Server to be set up on a user’s device. To help users browse and play podcasts, Plex has overhauled its player to allow for variable speed playback and has implemented new discovery features. “Podcasts are also a great fit for the media platform we’ve built here at Plex, which is probably why people have asked us to add them for years,” said Plex. The Home Screen in the Plex Android and iOS apps is now customisable, and tabs have been added at the bottom of the interface for easier navigation.
