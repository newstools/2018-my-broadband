Apple has issued a support document to its retail stores and service providers which details a new repair process when customers have problems with Face ID on the iPhone X, 9to5Mac reported. The document states that tech support employees should first run a diagnostic test to see if the problem with Face ID can be fixed by repairing the rear camera of the iPhone X. While it may seem strange to resolve an issue with Face ID by repairing the rear camera, 9to5Mac stated that the new Apple support document confirms reports of the issue that have appeared online. When an iPhone X owner experienced problems with FaceID and the rear camera shortly after launch, they were informed the front-facing True Depth camera and the rear telephoto camera were connected.
