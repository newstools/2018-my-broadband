Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub has confirmed the company will launch a new content service which will offer a wide selection of media. Speaking in an interview with MyBroadband, Joosub said the platform would launch in the coming weeks. “We will be launching a new video service in the coming weeks or so, which will include a variety of content,” said Joosub. The platform will offer multiple genres and types of content, and will include access to third-party services. Unlike most streaming services, Vodacom’s platform will offer access to other streaming services – including Netflix and Showmax. Joosub said the company would also have its own video service on offer, and users will be able to purchases a subscription or access to individual titles. When asked how Vodacom’s platform will differentiate itself in the content market, Joosub said the company is approaching the product from a different angle. “We are approaching it differently in that we are not trying to create content ourselves,” said Joosub. “We are ensuring that we provide the best third-party content in the best way to our customers,” he said. Joosub said the service would offer rich video content at attractive price points, and confirmed that Vodacom would make the platform more accessible to customers through discounted data usage options. The launch of the video platform has taken a bit longer than expected to finalise, but it will be compelling, said Joosub. The announcement from Joosub follows Vodacom recently launching its Social Ticket multimedia bundles, which provide discounted data usage for Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Showmax, YouTube, Apple Music, and more. The bundles promise discounts of up to 50% on data used for the services. Joosub said these bundles would provide added value to customers after Vodacom’s content service is officially launched.
