Gridhost has rebranded to 1-grid, following its separation from Webafrica in November 2017. The hosting company said the move last year was part of its vision to grow into a specialised web hosting business for SMEs. “We know this was not a smooth transition and we apologise to those of you that experienced unacceptable service levels during this time,” it said. With Gridhost.co.za now changing to become 1-grid.com, the company said it will have the space to innovate locally and globally. The changes are not just in the name, it added, and include a refreshed product range. A request to update payment details to the new 1-grid bank accounts will also be required from customers. “Please note that no changes are required on your end and all service login details will remain the same,” it added.
