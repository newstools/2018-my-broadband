Cell C has launched new voice minute bundles for customers. The company stated that contract customers have shown a “strong preference for the ability to customise their plans”, and the calling bundles complement its existing data bundles. The voice bundles can be bolted onto select voice contracts and are available in on-network or any-network varieties. “The bundles offer a range of inclusive minutes and validity periods, and offer our customers great value,” said a Cell C spokesperson. The new bundles, detailed in the table below, will be available from 1 June 2018.
