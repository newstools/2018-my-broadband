Canal+ subscribers in France now have the option to rent an Apple TV 4K for €6 per month, Variety reported. The French pay TV provider charges the same fee for its cable TV set-top boxes. To watch content included in a Canal+ package, subscribers will have to download the MyCanal app for the Apple TV. Subscribers will also receive access to the Apple tvOS App Store, Siri voice control, and first-party applications such as Apple Music. “Apple TV is the perfect showcase for our premium content exclusives, in particular cinema, sport, and our original creations,” the deputy general manager of Canal+ France, Frank Cadoret, said in a statement.
