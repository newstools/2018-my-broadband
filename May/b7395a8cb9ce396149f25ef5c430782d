Telkom has revealed the number of high-speed broadband customers who are on its network, during its financial results presentation for the year ended 31 March 2018. Speaking at the company’s presentation in Centurion, Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko outlined the migration of the company’s high-speed broadband customers to newer technologies such as LTE and fibre. The number of Telkom ADSL customers has decreased substantially in the past year, while the number of fibre and LTE customers has increased significantly. Total high-speed broadband customers have also increased by 36.4% over the last year, to just under 1.2 million. The number of Telkom ADSL, VDSL, LTE, and fibre customers for its 2016, 2017, and 2018 financial years is shown below. It must be noted that these numbers reflect customers who use Telkom as their Internet service provider. For example, the fibre number does not reflect all fibre subscribers with an active Openserve line – only users who subscribe to Telkom fibre products. Maseko said Telkom is seeing significant growth across high-speed broadband services, with an increasing number of customers adopting faster alternatives to ADSL. The 10Mbps user base on Telkom fibre has increased by 25%, with Telkom seeing a 54.5% growth in the take-up of its uncapped fibre offering. The company also attracted 255,000 LTE prepaid customers in the second half of the financial year. Maseko noted that the figures detailing Telkom LTE customers exclude the prepaid component of its LTE broadband division. He said that Telkom will increase its focus on high-speed broadband alternatives, including fibre, VDSL, and LTE going forward. “We will be quite smart about how we manage the migration away from copper technologies to newer technologies that provide a better broadband experience,” he said. “A desire of mine is that the entry-level speed across our suite of broadband offerings should be a minimum of 10Mbps,” said Maseko.
