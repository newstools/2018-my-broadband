Google has announced it is launching its new .app top-level domain (TLD). The company said the .app TLD is built for apps and app developers, and includes added security to help users showcase their applications. Google requires HTTPS to connect to all .app websites, helping to protect developers and users. “Because .app will be the first TLD with enforced security made available for general registration, it’s helping move the web to an HTTPS-everywhere future in a big way,” said Google. The .app domains are available to register through Google’s Early Access Programme until 7 May, after which they will become available to the general public. Users can visit the get.app website and select a registrar partner to purchase a .app domain name.
