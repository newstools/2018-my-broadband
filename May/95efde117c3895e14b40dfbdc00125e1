SYSPRO is a global, independent provider of industry-built ERP software designed to simplify business complexity for manufacturers and distributors. SYSPRO offers more than just a software solution, however. The company provides a global team of industry experts committed to ensuring the success of their clients. “Optimising value from ERP is more than just buying the software,” says Doug Hunter, SYSPRO Head of Professional Services Africa. “The real value starts coming from the relationship you have with SYSPRO or the partner you are dealing with.” Focused on delivering optimised performance and complete business visibility, the SYSPRO solution is highly-scalable, agile, and responsive – and it can be deployed on-premise, in the cloud, or accessed via a mobile device. “An ERP system should be an evolving thing,” says Deirdre Fryer, Regional Product Manager Africa. “As businesses are changing in today’s times, they need to be flexible, agile, and adaptive. ERP systems need to adapt along on that journey as well.” SYSPRO’s strengths lie in a simplified approach to technology, expertise in a range of industries, and a commitment to future-proofing customer and partner success. “SYSPRO has been a partner-centric organisation since inception,” says Mark Wilson, Managing Director Africa. “We have a strong belief in building an ecosystem of partners that are able to deliver to our customers – as this gives us unparalleled reach and coverage.” The video below provides more details about SYSPRO, and the value its ERP product suite can offer South African businesses.
