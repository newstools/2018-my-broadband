Facebook is making changes to political ads on Facebook and Instagram to fight abuse during elections in the United States. All election-related ads on Facebook and Instagram in the US must be clearly labelled. This labelling must include a “Paid for by” disclosure from the political advertiser at the top of the ad. “This will help ensure that you can see who is paying for the ad – which is especially important when the Page name doesn’t match the name of the company or person funding the ad,” said Facebook. When you click on the label associated with political ads, you’ll be taken to an archive with more information. Another change is that political advertisers will need to verify their identity and location. “We believe that increased transparency will lead to increased accountability and responsibility over time – not just for Facebook but advertisers as well.”
