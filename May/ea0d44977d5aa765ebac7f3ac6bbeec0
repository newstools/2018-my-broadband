Facebook fired an employee this week for allegedly using their privileged access to stalk women online. Motherboard reported this is not the first time this has happened. Citing former employees, the report stated that several employees have been fired for mishandling users’ personal information. One source said that multiple people had been fired for abusing their access, including using it to stalk former romantic partners. While concerns have been raised regarding the amount of non-public information Facebook employees and contractors have access to, a former Facebook employee told the publication there are consequences to abusing access. Employees are prompted whenever accessing non-public data, asking whether they are authorised to view the information and whether what they were doing was for work purposes. Facebook chief information security officer Alex Stamos said employees who abuse the security controls put in place are fired.
